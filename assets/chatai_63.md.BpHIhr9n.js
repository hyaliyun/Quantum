Q: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other., Now Is the Time is the second studio album by Alanis Morissette, released only in Canada on August 1, 1992. It was the final album for MCA Records Canada. Morissette recorded the album with Leslie Howe, who produced her debut album, \\"Alanis\\" (1991)., Leslie Howe is a Canadian musician and record producer based in Ottawa, Ontario. He has been a member of the bands One to One, Sal's Birdland and Artificial Joy Club, and produced Alanis Morissette's early pop music albums, \\"Alanis\\" (1991) and \\"Now Is the Time\\" (1992)., Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk)., \`\` An Emotion Away '' is a pop - dance song co-written by Alanis Morissette , Leslie Howe and Serge C√¥t√© , and produced by Howe for Morissette 's second album Now Is the Time ( 1992 ) . Its protagonist tells someone who \`\` completely took ( her ) heart by surprise '' that \`\` love is just an emotion away '' . It was released as the album 's first single in 1992 ( see 1992 in music ) and reached number twenty - four on the Canadian singles chart . \`\` An Emotion Away '' was the most successful single from Now Is the Time , which sold moderately . Leslie Howe engineered and mixed the song . The B - side on the cassette single was \`\` When We Meet Again '' , another track from Now Is the Time . The song , along with \`\` Too Hot '' and \`\` Feel Your Love '' ( from Morissette 's 1991 debut album Alanis ) , was used on the soundtrack of the 1993 film Just One of the Girls , in which Morissette appeared ., Jagged Little Pill is the third studio album and international debut album by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, first released on June 13, 1995, through Maverick Records. Morissette had released two successful albums in Canada, after which she left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began work on her next album after moving from her hometown, Ottawa, to Toronto; she did not make much progress until she traveled to Los Angeles, where she met Glen Ballard. Morissette and Ballard had an instant connection, and began co-writing and experimenting with sounds., A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. , Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is the fourth studio album and second internationally released album by singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released by Maverick Records in the United States on November 3, 1998., Dance-pop is a pop and dance subgenre that originated in the early 1980s. It is generally up-tempo music intended for nightclubs with the intention of being danceable but also suitable for contemporary hit radio. Developing from a combination of electronic dance music and pop music, with influences of disco music, post-disco, new wave, synthpop, electropop and house, it is generally characterised by strong beats with easy, uncomplicated song structures which are generally more similar to pop music than the more free-form dance genre, with an emphasis on melody as well as catchy tunes. The genre, on the whole, tends to be producer-driven, despite some notable exceptions., Alanis Nadine Morissette (born June 1, 1974) is a Canadian-American alternative rock singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actress. Morissette began her career in Canada in the early 1990s, with two commercially successful dance-pop albums. Afterwards, she moved to Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, and in 1995 released \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", a more rock-oriented album which sold more than 33 million units globally and is her most critically acclaimed work.

Answer the following question: Information: - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris. - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"√°sphaltos\\". - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and D√ºsseldorf. - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills. - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971. - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams. - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m¬≥ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb L√∂ffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\"). - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways. - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.

Vice-President Nicolas Maduro told mourners Mr Chavez, who led Venezuela for 14 years, remained \\"undefeated, pure, living for all time\\". Mr Maduro was due to be sworn in as acting president later on Friday. He has to call elections within 30 days. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles condemned Mr Maduro's imminent inauguration as \\"fraudulent\\". He said that \\"nobody elected\\" Maduro president and that the government was \\"abusing\\" its powers. Opposition parties are boycotting Mr Maduro's swearing-in, arguing that under the constitution the speaker of the National Assembly should be the one to take over as acting president. But, in a decision made public as the funeral went ahead, Venezuela's Supreme Court ruled in Mr Maduro's favour. In pictures: Hugo Chavez funeral Hugo Chavez, 58, died on Tuesday after a two-year battle with cancer. The vice-president began the funeral ceremony by presenting Mr Chavez's coffin with the sword of Simon Bolivar - the 19th-Century independence leader he claimed as his inspiration. In his eulogy, Mr Maduro said no other leader had been as vilified as Mr Chavez, but no-one had been able to stop him or his socialist \\"revolution\\". \\"The humble, the poor, the oppressed - we are his living testimony\\", Mr Maduro said. He also praised Mr Chavez's work for Latin American unity, and said he worked for \\"a world without empires\\". More than 30 world leaders attended the ceremony, including Cuban President Raul Castro, Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. A message was read out from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. By Irene CaselliBBC News, Caracas People lined up outside the military academy for the second consecutive day to see Hugo Chavez's body. The atmosphere was festive, with live music blasting through speakers. At the same time, foreign dignitaries from more than 30 countries, including Cuba's Raul Castro and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, started arriving for the state funeral. The ceremony started with the national anthem played by Venezuela's famous Simon Bolivar National Youth Orchestra, directed by Gustavo Dudamel, director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Vice-President Nicolas Maduro placed a replica of the sword used by Simon Bolivar, the 19th-Century revolutionary, on top of Mr Chavez's coffin. All presidents were then called one by one to stand by the coffin in groups of eight for a minute of silence. Mr Castro went first. Mr Ahmadinejad kissed the coffin. The ceremony ended with a speech by Mr Maduro on Mr Chavez's legacy. \\"Chavez lives. The fight goes on,\\" he said. Honour guards were made up of prominent Venezuelans, including student leaders and baseball players, Formula One driver Pastor Maldonado and conductor Carlos Dudamel. Mourners inside the venue chanted \\"Chavez did not die, he multiplied!\\" Ecumenical prayers were led by three religious leaders, including the American civil rights activist, Rev Jesse Jackson, who called for reconciliation between Venezuela and the US. \\"We share the same hemisphere, we play ball together, we trade resources together, we share dreams together,\\" he said. Outside, huge crowds dressed in the red sang \\"Chavez lives!\\" and \\"The struggle continues!\\" More than two million people have filed past Mr Chavez's coffin, and his body is to be put on permanent display. On Thursday, Mr Maduro said that Mr Chavez's body would be embalmed \\"like Lenin and Mao Zedong\\". The body will be moved to the Caracas military museum where in 1992 Mr Chavez - as an army officer - was captured after leading a failed coup. The building will be converted into a new \\"museum of the revolution\\", Mr Maduro said. Supporters want him eventually interred in Venezuela's national Pantheon alongside Simon Bolivar. However, under Venezuela's constitution, people may only be admitted to the Pantheon 25 years after their death. Mr Chavez, 58, was re-elected for a fourth term as president last October after saying he had recovered from his illness. He named Mr Maduro as his preferred successor following the recurrence of his cancer. The vice-president is to be sworn in as acting president after the funeral in a special session of the National Assembly. Under Venezuela's constitution, elections must be called within 30 days and the government has said it will abide by this. Mr Maduro will be the candidate for the governing United Socialist Party (PSUV).

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which island experienced more environmental degradation? Two islands of identical size with similar ecosystems experienced different destinies. Caribu island, inhabited by more natives, hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few. People from Hiji island, were pescotarian, and hardly ever fished. Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","completion":"A: Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Caribu Island experienced more environmental degradation. The inhabitants of Caribu Island hunted a few of the animal species there, contributing to the extinction of a few, while people from Hiji Island were pescotarians and hardly ever fished, implying a lesser impact on the ecosystem.

Article: ORLANDO -- The Orlando Police Department on Monday released audio from the 911 calls made by Omar Mateen the night he went on a rampage at Pulse nightclub, killing 49 people and injuring more than 50 others. Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber on Monday ordered that calls made by Mateen, who died during the massacre, be made public immediately. The city previously released a transcript of the calls. In the first call, made at at 2:48 a.m. on June 12, Mateen can be heard calmly pledging allegiance to ISIS. His voice rises in anger when he talks about the bombings in Iraq and Syria. Mateen emphatically tells a police negotiator that he needs to tell the U.S. government to stop bombings in Syria and Iraq. ‚ÄúWho am I speaking with, please?‚Äù the negotiator from the Orlando police asks. ‚ÄúYou are speaking with the person who pledges allegiance to the Islamic State of (inaudible),‚Äù Mateen responds. The negotiator then asks Mateen to tell him where he is located. ‚ÄúNo. Because you have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq,‚Äù Mateen says quickly. ‚ÄúThey are killing a lot of innocent people. So what am I to do here? When my people are getting killed over there. You get what I‚Äôm saying?‚Äù ‚ÄúI do. I completely get what you‚Äôre saying,‚Äù the negotiator answers. ‚ÄúWhat I am trying to do is prevent anyone else from getting ...‚Äù ‚ÄúYou need to stop the U.S. airstrikes,‚Äù Mateen interrupts. ‚ÄúThey need to stop the U.S. airstrikes, okay?‚Äù Later in the call, the dispatcher asks Mateen to tell him what he did. ‚ÄúYou already know what I did,‚Äù Mateen answers. The negotiator tells Mateen he is trying to keep him safe, and get this situation resolved peacefully. Mateen responds by saying there are vehicles outside with bombs in them. ‚ÄúYour people are going to get it and I‚Äôm going to ignite it if they try to do anything stupid,‚Äù Mateen says. The negotiator asks what vehicle, ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt want to see anybody get hurt.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. But I‚Äôll tell you this, they can take out a whole city block almost,‚Äù Mateen responds. In the call, Mateen also calls the Boston Marathon bomber his ‚Äúhomeboy.‚Äù He refers to himself as an Islamic soldier, and a Soldier of the God. Mateen also indicates that he is wearing a vest, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what they used in France,‚Äù he says. But later, he tells the dispatcher he is not wearing a vest after all. The call continues with Mateen ranting about Iraq and Syria, and demanding the bombings stop. At one point, he seems to hang up the call. The judge who ordered the release of the tapes said Monday she can‚Äôt make a decision on whether 232 other calls can be released until she has heard them. Media groups want the calls released so the public can evaluate the police response to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The city of Orlando says the calls depict suffering and shouldn‚Äôt be made public. The calls made by Mateen can be heard below, via CBS affiliate WKMG. ||||| The man on the phone said he was the person who had just opened fire June 12 inside Pulse nightclub, but Orlando police could not be sure. The caller, later identified as Omar Mateen, repeatedly hung up on the Orlando police negotiator who had to call him back more than a dozen times. From about 3:15 a.m. to about 3:20 a.m., officers could be heard in the background trying to pinpoint where Mateen might be. The background noise was \\"sterile,\\" said one officer, as if he were in an office. Or a bathroom, said another. \\"I'm still not convinced this guy's in there,\\" the negotiator said as Mateen's phone rang. Law enforcement officers were going to Mateen's address in Fort Pierce to check whether he was home, and Orlando police pinged his cellphone to establish his location. Despite his misgivings, the negotiator, who identified himself as Andy, treated Mateen seriously when they talked. He spoke calmly but with a sense of urgency as he tried to pry information from Mateen: where in the club he was, whether there were injured people with him, whether he had explosives or accomplices, what would get him to surrender. At the Orange County Regional History Center's private warehouse, archival specialists work on restoration, preservation and cataloguing items collected from the various memorials honoring the victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre, Friday, Sept. 1, 2016. (Joe Burbank) (Joe Burbank) The nearly 30 minutes of audio of Omar Mateen's 911 calls were released Monday. The written transcripts of the calls were made public in September. The attack on the LGBTQ nightclub left 49 people dead and at least 68 injured. Orlando police and Orange County deputies killed Mateen during a shootout just after 5 a.m. Mateen was the one who first made contact with police, calling 911 and pledging his allegiance to the Islamic State. He recited part of a prayer in Arabic before telling the dispatcher in English that he \\"did the shooting.\\" Throughout the calls, Mateen repeatedly said he committed the attack to \\"stop the U.S. airstrikes\\" on Iraq and Syria.

Write highlights for this article: British troops dressed in red jackets and black bearskin hats put on a military spectacle in London on Saturday to mark Queen Elizabeth's official birthday. They marched to music as other troops sat on horses for the annual ceremony, known as Trooping the Color. It took place on the Horse Guards Parade, the marching ground within sight of the queen's residence at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a lilac outfit and hat decorated with bow of pink and green, sat front and center to watch what many consider the most celebrated event on the British royal calendar. The queen, who turned 84 this year, was born on April 21 but celebrates her birthday on a Saturday in June when the weather is better. Trooping the Color dates at least to the early 18th century, when the colors -- or flags -- of the battalion were \\"trooped\\" down the ranks so they could be seen and recognized by all the soldiers, according to Buckingham Palace and the British Army. Since 1748, the ceremony has also marked the sovereign's official birthday, the palace said. Queen Elizabeth has attended it every year except for 1955, when a national rail strike canceled the event, the palace said. A limited number of tickets are available to the public to watch the event at the Horse Guards Parade. It is also shown live on TV, and others can watch the troops go by on The Mall, which leads from the palace to the parade. The ceremony is carried out by fully operational troops from the Household Division of the British Army. Only one color can be trooped at a time, and the five Household Regiments -- Grenadier, Coldstream, Scots, Irish, and Welsh Guards -- take their turn each year. This year it was the turn of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, who recently returned from Afghanistan. At the end of the ceremony, the queen climbed into an open-top horse-drawn carriage for the ride back to Buckingham Palace. The crowds along The Mall, lined with Union Jacks, cheered as she went past. The queen then stood on the palace balcony to watch a military fly-past that ended with aircraft trailing red, white, and blue, the colors of the British flag. She waved to the crowds and was joined by other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip; her son, Prince Charles; and her grandson, Prince William.

Given the question: Information: - The guanaco (\\"Lama guanicoe\\"), a camelid native to South America, stands between at the shoulder and weighs . Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears. - Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicu√±as, and guanacos. - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicu√±a and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicu√±a , not the guanaco . - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance. - The vicu√±a (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicu√±as produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicu√±a's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicu√±as highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicu√±a garments; today the vicu√±a is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms. - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18¬∞ south and 20¬∞ south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

Question: Process: - They expand to take the air in - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the climate improves happens, how will it affect oxygen in the air is absorbed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The process of respiration and the absorption of oxygen in the lungs is primarily based on a well-established mechanism within the human body. The process, as described in the prompt, involves the expansion of lungs, holding air, extracting oxygen, and expelling bad air. However, the perturbation hypothesis raises a thought-provoking question about the potential effects that an improved climate might pose on this process. In this context, we must first understand what an improved climate entails and then examine its direct or indirect effects on oxygen absorption. An improved climate can be interpreted in a few different ways. Generally, it could refer to reduced air pollution, decreased carbon dioxide concentrations, increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere, or a combination of these factors. Assuming this interpretation, we can then examine how these changes might affect the oxygen absorption process in the lungs. 1. Reduced air pollution: Air pollution consists of harmful particulate matter and gases that can pose health risks when inhaled. One potential benefit of reduced air pollution is that the lungs can efficiently perform their role in oxygen absorption. The presence of particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, can hinder the process by embedding themselves in lung tissues, which may cause inflammation, obstruct the airways, and impair the alveoli's ability to absorb oxygen effectively. Therefore, in an improved climate with reduced air pollution, the lungs may function more effectively, leading to improved oxygen absorption without direct changes to the process itself. 2. Decreased carbon dioxide concentrations: High levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere can not only contribute to climate change but also impact human health by causing a build-up of CO2 in the blood. When CO2 concentrations in the blood rise, it affects the delicate balance between oxygen and CO2 exchange in the lungs. An improved climate with lower CO2 concentrations can help maintain that balance, thus indirectly supporting the proper functioning of the oxygen absorption process in the lungs. 3. Increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere: An improved climate may also lead to increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere due to higher photosynthesis rates, particularly in forests and oceans. Higher levels of oxygen availability can contribute to improved lung function and oxygen absorption. However, it is essential to note that the atmosphere already contains a sufficient amount of oxygen (around 21%) for healthy breathing, so any increase may not necessarily have a significant impact on the human respiratory system. The oxygen absorption process itself may remain consistent, with no direct changes to the mechanism. In conclusion, an improved climate can have several positive effects on human health and the efficiency of the lungs in terms of oxygen absorption. While these improvements may not directly alter the process of respiration itself, they could contribute to an enhanced environment for the lungs to function, ultimately leading to better oxygen absorption and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to Fox News producer Nicole Busch, Romney's director of operations stood with the media the entire time they waited to catch a glimpse of the former Massachusetts Governor...only to tell reporters and cameras after an hour that Romney had already come and went. \\"Chicken Mitt!!\\" DNC spokesperson Brad Woodhouse wrote in a rapid fire email to reporters upon learning the Romney aide had misled the press while the candidate departed another exit. \\"Bwok-Bwok!\\" he continued. But in contrast to the DNC's caricature of Romney's actions, Donald Trump told Fox News Channel anchor Neil Cavuto afterwards that he and Romney had a \\"really had a great hour together\\" and that he was \\"impressed by certain things\\" Romney said during their meeting. \\"I thought he was very good at the debate, I think he did a good job, I did tell him that,\\" Trump said, although he has yet to endorse a candidate. Mitt Romney requested the one-on-one meeting with Donald Trump, their first since Romney declared a run for the Oval Office; fellow Republican hopefuls Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry have already met with the reality television host. Herman Cain has a meeting scheduled next week. In the interview with Cavuto, Trump walked back from less than flattering comments he has made about Romney in the past. \\"Mitt Romney is a basically small business guy, if you really think about it,\\" Trump said of his potential rival in April as he pondered the idea of a presidential run. \\"He was a hedge fund. He was a fund guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. He worked there. He didn't create it.\\" The hither-to lack of fuzzy feelings between the two men did not stop the DNC from trying to lump the two men together in a web video released Monday morning, entitled \\"Trump, Romney: You're Fired!\\" You can watch the DNC web video here. ||||| Fresh off a victory in the Michigan straw poll, Mitt Romney will be reaching out to another sizable part of the Republican base Monday -- Donald Trump Romney will be meeting with His Trumpness in New York on Monday afternoon, becoming the latest GOP presidential aspirant to court the developer/TV host/former potential candidate/birth certificate investigator. Rick Perry dined with Trump earlier this month at pricey, exclusive Jean-Georges in Manhattan. (You might recall that in June, Trump and Sarah Palin shared some slices of pizza in Times Square . Read into that what you will.) Michele Bachmann has also met with the Donald and plans to do so again.Why court the blessings of Trump? That‚Äôs a good question. Well, for one thing, there are still those out there who believe Trump should be president of the United States. There‚Äôs a whole website and everything. (It includes items such as ‚ÄúTrump Answers Boy‚Äôs Prayer for New Bike.‚Äù) For another, say what you will about the man, but he has a platform. He can pretty much show up on Piers Morgan ‚Äôs CNN show or Fox News just about whenever he likes. (And don‚Äôt forget ‚ÄúCelebrity Apprentice‚Äù on NBC . Don‚Äôt worry. He‚Äôs not going to let you forget it.) Third, he has money. And he knows other people with money. Presidential candidates like money.But Democrats are just as eager to associate Trump with the GOP, as the candidates seem to be to meet with him. Part of it is that it makes Perry, Romney and the like look a little less, well, serious. The other is that Trump is sort of the epitome of the fatcatness that Democrats argue the GOP protects. (This is what GOP calls \\"class warfare.\\")The Democratic National Committee, in fact, has released a video in advance of the Romney-Trump summit, imaginatively titled ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Fired‚Äù that paints both men as uber-capitalists who care little about the middle-class, education, Medicare or Social Security.Romney is on a small roll. He was widely viewed as handily winning the Fox News- Google debate Thursday night while his top rival, Perry, turned in a shaky performance. Then Perry lost a Florida straw poll he had been expected to win to Herman Cain . On Sunday, Romney trounced Perry and all others in a straw poll in his home state of Michigan.But can he win the coveted Trump endorsement? If there‚Äôs one thing to be sure of, it‚Äôs that Trump will keep America in suspense as long as possible before answering that question. ||||| Summary:","completion":"In September 2011, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney met with business mogul Donald Trump in New York City.

We were also told that even if they did do a refund it would be for the pizza only. Apparently they don't do complete refunds, which makes 0 sense. When the pizza did arrive, it was cold and the box was smashed. The garlic bread was bland and cold. The Caesar salad was soggy, and you could tell they had packaged it 45 minutes ago.

Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Recognize the Spanish sentence, 'Wicked no me importa, s√≥lo a d√≥nde ir.' Step 2: Identify the words in the sentence. The words are 'Wicked', 'no', 'me', 'importa', 's√≥lo', 'a', 'd√≥nde', and 'ir.' Step 3: Based on my understanding of Spanish, translate each word or term for its English equivalent: 'Wicked' is an English word so it remains 'Wicked'. 'no' means 'not' in English. 'me' translates to 'me' in English. 'importa' translates to 'matter' in English. 's√≥lo' translates to 'only' in English. 'a' is a preposition that can be translated to 'to' in English. 'd√≥nde' translates to 'where' in English. 'ir' translates to 'go' in English. Step 4: Now, let's put all of these translations together. However, the literal word-for-word translation might not make sense because Spanish and English have different sentence structures. We need to rearrange the words in a way that would sound natural in English. Literal translation: \\"Wicked not me matter, only to where go.\\" Adjusted, natural-sounding translation: \\"Wicked doesn't matter to me, only where to go.\\" So, the solution is: The Spanish sentence 'Wicked no me importa, s√≥lo a d√≥nde ir.' translates to 'Wicked doesn't matter to me, only where to go.' in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter / Updated By Lisa Flam Enormous flat-screens are in millions of homes, but come with a risk that many parents may not realize: children can be seriously hurt in a TV tip-over. The number of kids injured by a TV falling on them grew 125 percent between 1990 and 2011, according to a new study of emergency room records that calls for greater prevention efforts. Overall, more than 17,000 children under age 18 were treated each year for various TV-related injuries in ERs across the United States ‚Äì that‚Äôs one child every half hour ‚Äì during that time period, the study released Monday in the journal Pediatrics found. Between 2000 and 2011, 215 children died from injuries caused by a falling TV. ‚ÄúThis is a serious problem,ÔøΩ? said the study‚Äôs senior author, Dr. Gary Smith, a pediatrician at Nationwide Children‚Äôs Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told NBC News. ‚ÄúA child‚Äôs dying once every three weeks from a TV tip-over. The numbers are going up. This is a call to action. These are 100 percent preventable injuries.ÔøΩ? The increase is from a combination of more TVs in homes and a growing number of injuries from televisions falling from furniture that was not designed to hold them, Smith said. Forty-six percent of the tip-overs involved a TV falling off a dresser or armoire, while 31 percent were due to a TV falling from an entertainment center or TV stand, according to the study. The rising number of injuries ‚Äúdispels that myth that as flat-screens came onto the market, we would see a decline in TV tip-overs,\\" Smith said. \\"We‚Äôre seeing the opposite.ÔøΩ? The new research used national data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, tracked from 1990 to 2011. The lighter, top-heavy design of flat-screens could actually make them easier for a child to pull over, the study found. The number of kids under age 18 who were injured specifically in a TV tip-over rose to 12,300 in 2011, a 125 percent increase in 22 years. The rate of injury from TV tip-overs increased 95 percent. Children under the age of 5 were the most at risk -- accounting for 64 percent of the injuries -- because young kids can‚Äôt get out of the way as quickly as older children, Smith said. Almost 61 percent of the injured children were boys. Other than falling TVs, children were also hurt by striking or hitting the TV. The head and neck were the most commonly injured body parts, Smith said, noting that injuries ranged from bruising to death. Other injuries included lacerations, fractures and sprains. Some injuries are minor, but, ‚ÄúI have seen kids with major traumatic brain injuries as a result of this,ÔøΩ? said Smith, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance. The study did not differentiate between injuries caused by falling flat-screen televisions and the older, heavier cathode ray tube sets. But Smith speculated that injuries may be increasing as families buy new TVs, and move older ones onto unsuitable furniture. ‚ÄúWhat we think is going on is as families purchase a new flat-screen TV, the older TV is being displaced to other parts of the home where it‚Äôs placed in a less-safe position, such as on top of dresser, chest of drawers or armoire,ÔøΩ? Smith said. The study, he said, is a call for parents to secure their televisions and for a strengthening of stability standards for TVs. There are various products to make TVs safer ‚Äì straps, Velcro, L braces and mounts for flat-screens. ‚ÄúThe overriding recommendation is that all TVs, whether it‚Äôs a flat-screen or CRT, must be anchored to the wall to prevent tip-overs and if it‚Äôs on a piece of furniture, the furniture needs to be anchored to the wall as well,ÔøΩ? Smith said. Parents are urged against putting the remote control or toys on top of the television or the furniture it sits on, so kids won‚Äôt try to climb up after them. The Pediatrics study backs up previous research on the dangers of TV tip-overs. But the continued rise in injured children suggests many parents simply aren‚Äôt getting the message. ‚ÄúI think a lot of people think it‚Äôs not going to happen to them,ÔøΩ? said Dr. Ryan Stanton, an emergency physician at MESA Medical Group in Lexington, Ky., and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Stanton, a father of two kids ages 3 and 5, said his own flat-screen TV is bolted to the wall and other televisions are secured as well. ‚ÄúEverybody knows that after kids get to be 2 ¬Ω years old, there‚Äôs nothing too high,ÔøΩ? he said. ‚ÄúYou have to look at it from the point of a child. Just grab it and pull, if it starts to tip over and is unstable, your kid‚Äôs going to do that, too.ÔøΩ? Tips from SafeKids.org on how to stabilize any TV in your home: Mount flat-screen TVs to the wall to prevent them from toppling off stands. Follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions to ensure that you have a secure fit. If you have a large, heavy, old-style cathode ray tube (CRT) TV, place it on a low, stable piece of furniture. Use brackets, braces or wall straps The Consumer Electronics Association has also developed a flyer on TV placement safety to be included in TV instruction manuals, according to its website. NBC News associate producer Stacey Naggiar andsenior writer JoNel Alecciacontributed to this report ||||| More US children injured by falling televisions - study Most US households own at least one television set Falling television sets have injured nearly 200,000 children in the US over 20 years, a study has found. Most injuries were not serious, and only 2.6% required hospital admission, the study in the journal Pediatrics says. But the injury rate has climbed substantially for these accidents, it says. Researchers say changes in the location of TV sets in the home may be responsible for the figure. Most injuries occur in children under five, with head and neck wounds the most common. The researchers looked at national figures for non-fatal television-related injuries to children in the period from 1990 to 2011. In 2011, 12,300 children nationwide received emergency treatment for TV-related injuries, compared with 5,455 in 1990, the study said. According to the study, 99% of US households own at least one television, and 55% have three or more. Researchers say the number of TV sets may not be the only reason for the increasing number of injuries. \\"We speculate that changes in the location of TV placement in the home may be responsible,\\" said the study. \\"Older TVs may be relegated to less safe locations in the home, such as on dressers or other unsuitable furniture.\\" The increasing popularity of flat-screen TVs may be another key factor. \\"Lighter weights coupled with a less bulky design may make flat panels more easily tipped than CRTs (cathode ray tube) and may be contributing to the observed increase in the rate of injuries associated with falling TVs,\\" the study said. |||||","completion":"A study published in the journal Pediatrics has revealed that the presence of large flat-screen TVs in homes poses a significant risk of injury to children in the event of a TV tip-over. Between 1990 and 2011, the rate of children injured by a falling TV grew by 125 percent, with more than 17,000 children under the age of 18 being treated annually for TV-related injuries in emergency rooms during this time. The study also showed that between 2000 and 2011, 215 children died from injuries due to a falling TV. Dr. Gary Smith, a pediatrician at Nationwide Children's Hospital and the study‚Äôs senior author, described this as a \\"serious problem\\" and a \\"call to action,\\" pointing out that these accidents are entirely preventable. The increase is attributed to a rise in the number of TVs in homes, coupled with more injuries from TVs falling from furniture not intended to bear their weight. According to the study's findings, 46% of these tip-overs involved a TV falling off a dresser or armoire, while 31% resulted from a TV falling from an entertainment center or TV stand. Contrary to the belief that the influx of flat-screen TVs would reduce the incidence of TV tip-overs, Smith pointed out that the opposite is happening. The lighter, top-heavy design of flat-screens can indeed make them more prone to tipping over when pulled by a child. By 2011, the number of children under 18 who were injured specifically by a falling TV rose to 12,300. Kids under the age of 5 were found to be most at risk, accounting for 64 percent of these injuries. These children might not be able to avoid the falling object as effectively as older children, and almost 61 percent of the injured children were boys. Besides falling TVs, children also got hurt when striking or hitting the TV. Smith recommended anchoring all TVs to the wall, regardless of their type, to prevent tip-overs. If a TV stands on a piece of furniture, that furniture should also be secured. Devices such as straps, Velcro, L braces, and mounts for flat-screens can help ensure TV safety. Furthermore, parents should avoid placing toys or remote controls on top of the TV or the furniture it rests on to discourage children from trying to reach for them, reducing the risk of a tip-over. Despite studies highlighting the risks of TV tip-overs, the continuing rise in the number of injured children implies that the message isn't reaching all parents. The study used national data from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, covering the period from 1990 to 2011. It did not differentiate between injuries caused by falling flat-screen TVs and older, bulkier cathode ray tube sets, but Smith speculated that the number of injuries might be increasing as families buy new TVs and place older ones on unsuitable furniture. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of parents securing their televisions and bringing about a reinforcement of stability standards for TVs to ensure child safety. This is aligned with the recommendations from SafeKids.org: secure flat-screen TVs to the wall as per the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions and put heavy, old-style CRT TVs on low, stable furniture.

Summarize the following: If you begin to experience pain associated with back labor, ask your partner, birthing coach, or anyone else who may be in the room with you to give you a back massage. This can help ease some of the pain associated with back labor. Have your partner apply counter pressure to your lower back with a balled up fist. Rolling something along the back, like a tennis ball, can also help. The double hip squeeze is a massage position that many women find helpful during back labor. Lean forward and have two people apply pressure to your hips. Moving during labor can help ease the pain of back labor. This could also improve fetal position, making back labor less acute. Most hospitals will let you walk in the hallways during labor, provided there are no specific complications related to your pregnancy that would make walking difficult. Shifting how you are sitting during labor can help shift fetal position and ease the pain of back labor. If possible, try straddling a chair and leaning forward slightly. You could also kneel against a pile of pillows or, if available, a birthing ball. You can also get on your hands and knees temporarily as this eases pressure on the spine, a major contributor to the pains and discomforts of back labor. Try lying on your side instead of your back when lying down as this can help change your baby's position and ease pains of back labor. Applying heat to the back, hips, and sides can help soothe pains associated with back labor. You can use a heating pad, as long as your hospital allows this and there is somewhere in the labor room to plug it in. You can also bring in a homemade hot compress. You can usually just apply warm water to a towel until it's damp and apply it to the area that's experiencing pain. A nurse may be able to provide a compress for you. Cold also helps ease the pain. If applying heat is not working, try an ice pack or a cold, damp towel.","completion":"If you have back pain during labor, you can try a few things to feel better.

Plot title: Evil Dead II Movie plot: The film begins with a simplified recap of the events of the first film. Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archaeology Professor Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis (or Book of the Dead), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and later possesses Linda. Ash is then forced to decapitate his girlfriend with a shovel in self-defense, and buries her near the cabin. The film then picks up where the first film left off, where a spirit is seen hunting for Ash. Ash becomes briefly possessed by the demon, but when day breaks the spirit is gone, and Ash returns to normal. Ash finds little chance of safety, however, as the bridge leading to the cabin is destroyed. Linda's revived head attacks Ash by biting his hand. Ash brings Linda's severed head to the shed, where her headless body attacks him with a chainsaw. Ash gains the upper hand and slashes the relentless zombified Linda to death, killing her a second and final time. Later, Ash is forced to sever his bitten right hand, which has become possessed. While Ash deals with this force, the professor's daughter, Annie, and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with more pages of the Necronomicon in tow, only to find the destroyed bridge. They enlist the help of Jake and Bobby Joe to guide them along an alternate trail to the cabin. The four of them find an embattled Ash, who is, seemingly, slowly being driven insane due to his encounter with the demon, such as hallucinating that the room comes to life and begins laughing hysterically at him.

Paul Starks speaks to the media in the parking lot outside the Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, Md., Friday, May 6, 2016. A woman was killed and three people... (Associated Press) SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) ‚Äî The shooting spree began with a domestic slaying in an unusually public place. According to police, Eulalio Tordil, a federal security officer, shot and killed his estranged wife as she waited to pick up her children in the parking lot of a suburban Washington high school on Thursday afternoon. He also shot and wounded a bystander who tried to intervene, police said. Detectives worked through the night, trying to use cellphone technology to pinpoint Tordil's location. But they weren't able to catch him. The next day, according to police, he struck again, this time apparently choosing his victims at random. On Friday morning, police said, Tordil shot three people outside an upscale mall in Bethesda, 15 miles away from the high school. One man died and two others were wounded, one of them critically. Then, he drove to a supermarket five miles away in Silver Spring, where he fatally shot a woman who was sitting in her car, police said. The attacks were reminiscent of the D.C. sniper shootings, which paralyzed the nation's capital and its suburbs in 2002. In an eerie coincidence, the supermarket slaying occurred just a few hundred feet from where the snipers fired their first shots. Unlike with the snipers, however, police had an idea about who was responsible. Plainclothes officers spotted Tordil's car at a strip mall across the street from the supermarket, and they watched him for more than an hour as he moved from store to store, eating at Boston Market and getting coffee at Dunkin' Donuts, police said. Fearing that he wanted to provoke officers into shooting him, police waited him out until he returned to his car. Then they boxed him in and drew their guns. He emerged from the car with his hands up. \\"We did not want to endanger anyone and have a shootout when we took him into custody,\\" Montgomery County Police Chief Thomas Manger said. \\"That may have been what he wanted.\\" Instead, Tordil will have to answer in court for the string of carnage attributed to him: three people dead and another three wounded in roughly 20 hours. He was charged Friday evening with murder in the death of his wife, Gladys, a high school chemistry teacher. Charges are pending in the other shootings, and he'll likely face his first court appearance Monday. Hank Stawinski, the police chief in neighboring Prince George's County, where the school shooting took place, lamented that his detectives couldn't find Tordil sooner. \\"It's tragic that we were not able to intervene prior to additional individuals being harmed,\\" Stawinski said. Tordil worked for the Federal Protective Service, which provides security at federal properties. He was put on administrative duties in March after a protective order was issued against him when his wife said he had threatened to harm her if she left him, The Washington Post reported (http://wapo.st/1WOrwyg). Tordil subjected their children to \\"intense-military-like discipline,\\" like pushups and detention in a dark closet, according to the order. The protective service said Tordil's weapon, badge and credentials were taken when he was placed on leave. Police found a weapon in his car but did not describe it. The arrest occurred in full view of dozens of witnesses who were working, shopping, eating lunch or getting their nails done. \\"They had a bunch of guns pointed at him, and he was coming out of the car with his hands up,\\" said Dominique Lee, who was walking out of the flower shop where she works when Tordil was arrested. \\"He just got out of his car. He gave up,\\" said Jason Palmer, a private investigator who lives nearby and had started to search for the gunman himself. \\"They pinned him in.\\" The arrest took place just steps away from a Michaels craft store that was the first target of D.C. sniper John Allen Muhammad. Muhammad's shot into the store did not hit anyone, but he killed a man about a mile away less than an hour later, kicking off a three-week killing spree that left 10 dead. Tordil ate at the same Boston Market as Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo, who was also convicted in the sniper attacks. \\"They ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance here today, which was an irony that was not lost on me,\\" said Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy, who prosecuted Muhammad. \\"I think it's a coincidence.\\" ___ Associated Press contributors include Jessica Gresko, Sarah Brumfield and Alex Brandon. ___ Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols.

(Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) A string of deadly shootings in suburban Maryland led police to the same man. Here's what we know about the investigation. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) When Gladys Tordil went to court in March to plead for protection against her husband, she portrayed him as a man who had menaced her and her two daughters for at least a decade. Eulalio ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù Tordil, 62, a career law enforcement officer and former Army reservist with a black belt in aikido, subjected his stepdaughters to ‚Äúintense-military-like discipline ‚Äî push ups, detention in dark closet‚Äù and used violence against his wife, Gladys Tordil said in a petition for a restraining order filed in Prince George‚Äôs County District Court. During one fight in 2010, she told the court, ‚ÄúHe slapped me so hard during our altercation, my glasses broke on my face.‚Äù On March 2 of this year, she said, ‚ÄúHe threatened to harm me if I leave him.‚Äù The protective order was granted. Eulalio Tordil‚Äôs superiors at the Federal Protective Service took his gun and badge as a result of the complaint and put him on administrative duty. But that didn‚Äôt save Gladys, a 44-year-old chemistry teacher at Parkdale High School.

May 5, 2016 Parents and relatives gathered outside the High Point High School cafeteria in Beltsville, Md., to pick up students in the wake of a shooting that left one person dead and one wounded. Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. He is charged with first-degree murder and related charges in connection with his wife‚Äôs slaying. [Suspect in custody in string of shootings in suburban Maryland] He may have meant to be the final fatality, allegedly telling colleagues that he wanted to commit ‚Äúsuicide by cop,‚Äù according to two people in law enforcement. In the hours after the first shooting, a picture of the twice-divorced Tordil emerged of a longtime ‚Äî and well-armed ‚Äî police officer with a history of domestic turmoil. The recent protective order included allegations that Tordil physically abused his two stepdaughters and his wife over the course of a decade. It detailed a personal arsenal that included a .40-caliber handgun, a .45-caliber handgun, an M4, a revolver and a ‚Äúhunting gun‚Äù at home. His favorite quote, according to his Facebook page, is the misspelled: ‚ÄúYou can ran, but you can‚Äôt hide.‚Äù Tordil created a Youtube channel where he posted videos of his stepdaughters performing concerts in Arizona and he also made a playlist of his favorite songs including musicians playing covers of Nowhere Man by the Beatles, Green Day‚Äôs Time of Your Life and Poison‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvery Rose Has Its Thorn.‚Äù Tordil is originally from the Philippines, and he still has ties there. Gladys Tordil moved her daughters to Maryland from the Philippines in 2006, according to the protective order. Surveillance footage recorded Maryland shooting suspect Eulalio Tordil, 62, a federal police officer as he was barricaded by authorities after leaving a Boston Market restaurant. Tordil was quickly arrested. (WUSA9) Tordil served 15 years in the Army reserve, according to the database Nexis. Montgomery police said he was an Adelphi resident. He began his federal employment in October 1987 as a police officer with the General Services Administration, according to a federal employee database. Later, he joined the Department of Homeland Security and was paid a salary of more than 90,000. Almost a decade ago, Tordil was accused of misusing a housing program that aimed to help law enforcement officers. Tordil obtained a 26,500 discount on HUD-owned property in Hyattsville, Md., under a Good Neighbor program but didn‚Äôt live at the residence, according to a 2008 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General. The report said that Tordil agreed to pay HUD 15,900 as part of a civil settlement. At least once in 1995, he helped teach a women‚Äôs self-defense course to staffers at the National Institutes of Health, Md., one of the agencies that was put on lockdown during the manhunt for Tordil. Tordil was working in Phoenix in 2005 when Stephen Jeckel met him at a martial-arts studio where both were students. Tordil, who was more advanced in the craft, became a second teacher to Jeckel, who is now an aikido instructor himself. He described Tordil as kind and family-oriented. ‚ÄúThe man I knew wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly,‚Äù said Jeckel, who remained in touch with Tordil after he returned to the Washington area. But Thursday night, police said, Tordil went to the Beltsville, Md., high school where he knew his estranged wife was picking up her daughters. Gladys Tordil was a popular chemistry teacher known to dote on her children and her students alike. Chris Mejia, a friend of Tordil‚Äôs two daughters at High Point High, remembers her paying for bowling and pizza for students who couldn‚Äôt afford to pay their own way. ‚ÄúShe was always happy, always singing, always dancing,‚Äù said ¬≠Mejia, the school‚Äôs senior class president, who has started a ¬≠GoFundMe page to raise scholarship money for the two daughters, both seniors preparing to start college in the fall. One of the daughters was leaving the school‚Äôs band room Thursday night just as her mother was shot, according to Mejia, who has talked with a student who was with her at the time. The other student had to pull the girl back from the scene, he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the whole school panicked,‚Äù Mejia said. The violence continued Friday when Tordil allegedly opened fire outside the Macy‚Äôs at Westfield Montgomery Mall, killing one man and wounding two other people. Then he allegedly drove to a nearby Giant in Aspen Hill and shot a woman sitting in her car. Police said they have no evidence Tordil knew any of Friday‚Äôs victims. Tordil ended his alleged killing spree with a strangely calm visit to a shopping plaza. According to Montgomery State‚Äôs Attorney John McCarthy, Tordil parked, bought a cup of coffee at Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, went to a Michaels craft store to ‚Äúbrowse around,‚Äù and then ordered lunch at Boston Market. Whatever plans he might have had to go out with further violence were interrupted by as many as 100 police officers who were waiting as he left the restaurant. Officers rammed his car and surrounded him. Asked why the suspect didn‚Äôt shoot himself or the police, McCarthy said, ‚ÄúThat was the fear everyone had. He didn‚Äôt.‚Äù Theresa Vargas, Michael S. Rosenwald, John Woodrow Cox, Alice Crites, Martin Weil and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A shooting spree took place in suburban Washington D.C., beginning with Eulalio Tordil, a federal security officer, killing his estranged wife in the parking lot of a high school. After eluding police overnight, Tordil then shot three people outside a shopping mall in Bethesda, Maryland, killing one and critically wounding another. His next attack was at a supermarket in Silver Spring, where he fatally shot a woman sitting in her car. For over an hour, plainclothes officers watched Tordil's movements, eventually boxing him in and taking custody of him. He is charged with first-degree murder and related charges in connection with his wife's slaying."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

First, he promoted Confucian orthodoxy and reversed what he saw as his father's laxness by cracking down on unorthodox sects and by decapitating an anti-Manchu writer his father had pardoned. In 1723 he outlawed Christianity and expelled Christian missionaries, though some were allowed to remain in the capital. Next, he moved to control the government. He expanded his father's system of Palace Memorials which brought frank and detailed reports on local conditions directly to the throne without being intercepted by the bureaucracy, and created a small Grand Council of personal advisors which eventually grew into the emperor's de facto cabinet for the rest of the dynasty. He shrewdly filled key positions with Manchu and Han Chinese officials who depended on his patronage. When he began to realize that the financial crisis was even greater than he had thought, Yongzheng rejected his father's lenient approach to local landowning elites and mounted a campaign to enforce collection of the land tax. The increased revenues were to be used for \\"money to nourish honesty\\" among local officials and for local irrigation, schools, roads, and charity. Although these reforms were effective in the north, in the south and lower Yangzi valley, where Kangxi had wooed the elites, there were long established networks of officials and landowners. Yongzheng dispatched experienced Manchu commissioners to penetrate the thickets of falsified land registers and coded account books, but they were met with tricks, passivity, and even violence.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who is the sister of the woman that the flight sergeant asks to marry him? , can you please find it? Celia Crowson and her family go on holiday to the south coast of England in the summer of 1939. Soon afterwards the Second World War breaks out and Celia's father joins what was to become the Home Guard and her more confident sister Phyllis joins the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Fearing her father's disapproval if she moves away from home, Celia hesitates about joining up but eventually her call-up papers arrive. Hoping to join the WAAF or one of the other services, Celia instead gets posted to a factory making aircraft components, where she meets her co-workers, including her Welsh room-mate Gwen Price and the vain upper middle class Jennifer Knowles. Knowles dislikes the work they have to do at the factory, causing friction with their supervisor Charlie Forbes which eventually blossoms into a verbally combative romance. A nearby RAF bomber station sends some of its men to a staff dance at the factory, during which Celia meets and falls in love with an equally shy young Scottish flight sergeant Fred Blake. Their relationship encounters a crisis when Fred refuses to tell Celia when he is sent out on his first mission, but soon afterwards they meet and make up, with Fred asking Celia to marry him. After the wedding they spend their honeymoon at the same south coast resort as the Crowsons went to in 1939, finding it much changed with minefields and barbed wire defending against the expected German invasion.

Given the question: Bob just came from a hot air balloon ride. On his way home he saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, but balloon B was inflated. He was wondering how balloons go up so effortlessly. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would balloon B have higher or lower inside pressure than balloon A? Hint: Many people enjoy riding in hot air balloons. Some use them for romantic picnics and marriage proposals. Others race in competitions. Being above the earth gives a whole new perspective on the world around us. As the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of those air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. After a while the balloon is completely expanded and the flight is ready to take off. The answer is:","completion":"Balloon B would have higher inside pressure than balloon A. Step 1: Identify relevant information from the paragraph. The paragraph states that at the beginning of a hot air balloon ride, the balloon is flat because the pressure inside the balloon equals the pressure outside. When the air inside the balloon is heated, the speed of movement of air molecules increases and the pressure goes up. Step 2: Apply the information to the question. Bob saw two balloons, balloon A and balloon B. Balloon A was flat, and balloon B was inflated. Since balloon B is inflated, it is likely that the air inside it has been heated and has higher pressure compared to the flat balloon A, which has its inside pressure equal to the outside pressure. Step 3: Conclude the answer based on the analysis. Given the increased pressure inside the inflated balloon B due to the heated air, balloon B would have higher inside pressure than balloon A."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Derek also wakes up to find that he landed in a seagull's nest. He also finds that his brain is leaking out the back of his head, so he stuffs it back in and uses a hat to hold it in place.That night, Frank, Ozzy, and Barry sneak into the aliens' house and find a room filled with bloody cardboard boxes. They kidnap an alien and Frank wears its shirt to infiltrate an alien meeting. He finds out that the residents of Kaihoro have been harvested for alien fast food for this intergalatic fast food chain called 'Crum's Country Delights'. Robert vomits into a bowl, which the aliens dine on, including the disguised (and disgusted) Frank. He escapes and tells the team members of the plan. They sneak out to save Giles as the aliens sleep.At sunrise, they try to leave but are attacked by the aliens. A long and climatic gun battle breaks out with dozens of ailens (wieling AK-47 assault rifles and various automatic weapons) battle the four humans.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2). The Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989 encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.\\"?","completion":"Question: What is the difference between the Scooter and the Small Dark Spot in terms of their observed characteristics and movements during the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989?

After the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city. The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later. Qinzong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to Huining , where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like \\"Muddled Virtue\\" and \\"Double Muddled\\". In 1128 the Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural.

So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4‚Äì5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know‚Ä¶ it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth ‚Ä¶and he kept rolling his tongue on mine.

Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione (Wanda Hendrix), young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for a hundred ducats.

We have the problem: -2 = 3*n + 13 Our goal is to find the value of \\"n\\". To do that, we need to get \\"n\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. So let's move the other pieces away from \\"n.\\" 1. First, let's take the 13 away from the right side. To do this, we'll subtract 13 from both sides of the equation: -2 - 13 = 3*n Now let's simplify: -15 = 3*n 2. Next, we need to get rid of the 3 that is next to the \\"n.\\" Since 3 is multiplied with \\"n\\" (3*n), we can remove it by dividing both sides of the equation by 3: -15 √∑ 3 = 3*n √∑ 3 Let's simplify it: -5 = n So, the value of \\"n\\" is -5.

Write a text based on this summary: rural social security computer system being tried out in china Text:","completion":"Title: Pioneering the Rural Social Security Computer System in China Introduction: In recent years, China has been focusing on improving the quality of life for its vast rural population. With ongoing advancements in technology, the Chinese government has adopted innovative measures to ensure that rural inhabitants receive proper social security benefits and services. As part of this initiative, China has implemented a trial of the Rural Social Security Computer System, aiming to revolutionize the way rural communities access and benefit from social security. Rural social security in China: In China, the rural population constitutes a significant percentage of the country's total population. With the urban-rural income gap expanding over the years, delivering adequate social security benefits to rural residents has become a critical area of focus for the government. The primary goals include eradicating poverty, ensuring healthcare access, providing old-age security, increasing employment, and offering other essential social services, thereby enhancing the quality of life for millions of rural inhabitants. The inception of the Rural Social Security Computer System: Understanding the dire need to reform its social security framework, the Chinese government has launched the Rural Social Security Computer System. This new approach centers around using advanced technology to improve the delivery and efficiency of social security services in rural regions. The Rural Social Security Computer System will integrate various databases and management systems related to rural social security, such as healthcare, employment, and pension funds. Moreover, this integrated system will provide a single platform catering to multiple functions, enabling a seamless and streamlined process for rural inhabitants to avail social security services. Benefits and features of the Rural Social Security Computer System: The Rural Social Security Computer System comes with numerous benefits and features designed to revolutionize the social security landscape in rural China. Some of these benefits include: 1. Enhancing efficiency: By consolidating multiple databases and systems under one unified platform, the Rural Social Security Computer System will significantly improve the efficiency at which social security services are delivered to rural residents, reducing delays and bureaucratic hurdles. 2. Improving access and convenience: With the Rural Social Security Computer System, rural inhabitants will no longer need to visit multiple government offices to access social security services. The computer system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, enabling residents to avail benefits from the comfort of their homes or local community centers. 3. Promoting transparency and accountability: The Rural Social Security Computer System streamlines the process of tracking the allocation and distribution of government funds. This transparent system will allow both officials and recipients to monitor the utilization of social security resources, promoting accountability and eliminating potential corruption. 4. Facilitating data-driven decisions: With the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data, the Rural Social Security Computer System will empower policymakers with valuable insights to inform and shape future social security policies, benefiting rural Chinese citizens in the long run. Challenges and future prospects: The implementation of the Rural Social Security Computer System is not without challenges. As it is a pilot program, there may be teething issues during implementation, such as inadequate infrastructure, lack of digital literacy among rural residents, and potential cyber threats. However, the Chinese government is committed to addressing these concerns, providing training to local officials, and investing in rural digital infrastructure to ensure the successful deployment of the system. In conclusion, the Rural Social Security Computer System is a pioneering initiative that holds great promise in transforming social security services in rural China. By embracing technology and striving for innovation, China is taking a significant step towards bridging the urban-rural divide and improving the lives of millions of rural inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

Movie title: The Whales of August Context: The Whales of August tells the story of two elderly widowed sisters near the end of their lives, spending a summer in a seaside house in Maine. The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations. In flashbacks, actresses Margaret Ladd, Mary Steenburgen and Tisha Sterling (Sothern's real-life daughter) play respectively Libby, Sarah, and Tisha as young women.

Write a title for this article: Another woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of touching her inappropriately. Kristin Anderson alleged to The Washington Post on Friday that Trump reached his hand up her skirt, uninvited, during a night at a Manhattan club in the early 1990s. She said that she was in her 20s at the time, and was sitting with friends on a red velvet couch when she allegedly felt Trump‚Äôs fingers graze her inner thigh and touch her vagina through her underwear. She claimed that she immediately pushed the hand away and left the couch before turning back to allegedly see Trump. ‚ÄúHe was so distinctive looking ‚Äî with the hair and the eyebrows,‚Äù she told the Post. ‚ÄúI mean, nobody else has those eyebrows.‚Äù The incident, she said, left her ‚Äúvery grossed out and weirded out.‚Äù Multiple friends confirmed Anderson‚Äôs story to the Post, but one said they laughed off the alleged encounter at the time. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a sexual come-on,‚Äù Anderson alleged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why he did it. It was like just to prove that he could do it, and nothing would happen. There was zero conversation. We didn‚Äôt even really look at each other.

Trump has strongly denied all of the allegations, asserting during a Florida speech on Thursday that the claims are ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù and ‚Äúabsolutely false.‚Äù In response to Anderson‚Äôs claims, Trump‚Äôs spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement, ‚ÄúMr. Trump strongly denies this phony allegation by someone looking to get some free publicity.

She said she decided to speak out after reading the accounts shared in The New York Times by two women who claimed Trump also groped them, and a story by a PEOPLE writer who alleged the businessman sexually assaulted her.

Given the question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose eat more healthy food happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of eating more healthy food can have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's functioning process. Let me explain step-by-step: 1. Consuming healthy foods can lead to better nutrient absorption: Eating a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients can assist in improving the overall function of the liver. This is because the liver can more effectively process these nutrients into forms that the body can use. 2. Reduced exposure to toxins: By consuming healthier food options and avoiding unhealthy, processed, and fried foods, the number of toxins entering the body is minimized. This results in the liver not having to work as hard to remove these harmful substances from the blood. Consequently, it may allow the liver to function more efficiently and softer. 3. Better fat processing: Eating healthy fats, such as those found in fish, nuts, and olive oil, can protect the liver from damage and help process fat more effectively. The liver can then produce bile more efficiently, which aids in the absorption of fat into the bloodstream. 4. Improved glycogen storage: Eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates and avoiding excessive simple sugars can help maintain stable blood sugar levels. This allows the liver to store extra carbohydrates as glycogen more efficiently, providing the body with the fuel it requires when needed. Therefore, the perturbation of eating more healthy food will likely have a positive effect on the liver, allowing it to work more efficiently and softly while performing its essential functions. This improvement in liver function can directly contribute to overall better health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a premise, a hypothesis, and an update. The premise sentence describes a real-world situation and is always assumed to be true. The hypothesis sentence describes an assumption or inference that you might make about that situation having read the premise. The update provides additional information about the situation that might weaken or strengthen the hypothesis. A weakener is a statement that weakens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much less likely to believe the hypothesis is true. A strengthener is a statement that strengthens the hypothesis, that is, it makes you much more likely to believe the hypothesis is true. Your task is to answer with 'strengthener' or 'weakener' if the update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis, respectively.

Update: Other students around her practice the same move Solution:","completion":"Strengthener Explanation: Premise: An Asian woman is practicing martial arts in a pink uniform. Hypothesis: The woman is at a self-defense class. Update: Other students around her practice the same move. Based on the given premise, hypothesis, and update, let's see how the update affects the hypothesis. 1. The premise tells us that a woman is practicing martial arts in a pink uniform. 2. The hypothesis assumes that she might be at a self-defense class. 3. The update provides additional information that other students around her are practicing the same move. This update strengthens the hypothesis because it's more likely that the woman is at a self-defense class if other students are also practicing the same move. It implies a group setting typically found in classes, where multiple people learn and perform the same techniques. Therefore, the update is a strengthener."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A lean-to is a simple outdoor construction, and only requires something for branches or a tarp to ‚Äúlean‚Äù against. Long boulders or fallen trees can be ideal for acting as a horizontal brace to lean other sticks or brush against. Any large, immobile object can work. If you have a tarp and some rope, you can make a lean-to between two trees. These sticks should be somewhat sturdy, as they will form a side of the shelter. Be sure that there is enough room between them, the brace, and the ground for you to crawl inside comfortably. You should have just enough space under your brace for you and anyone else with you to crawl into. The more extra space you have there, the harder it will be to keep yourself warm. If you can, keep the lean-to‚Äôs profile low to ground. This will help keep you further out of the line of wind, and won‚Äôt attract attention. This is helpful if you are trying to avoid detection, or otherwise stay out of sight. You can use leaves, grass, and moss to build a wall on the outside of your lean-to. These will provide further insulation and protection from the elements. Nearly any small forest debris will work. Just make sure to pack it tightly on the wall frame so it won't blow away readily. You can pile more of this debris on the floor and interior of your lean-to to provide extra insulation. Another way to help keep warm under your lean-to is to build a fire. Dig a small hole for your fire on the open side of your lean-to. Be sure to keep it a safe distance from any underbrush and your shelter. If you do build a fire, keep an eye on it at all times. If you want to go to sleep, make sure someone will be able to stay up to watch it, or just put it out completely. Put a ring of stones around the fire pit to help rein it in.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In 1554 the Pechenga Monastery was raided by the Swedes. The governor of Novgorod Paletsky sent Nikita Kuzmin to Stockholm to ask for an explanation, but the Russian representative was imprisoned. In response Russia mounted an organized attack with up to 20,000 soldiers in March 1555. With its initially 1,000 men, Finland could not stand against the invading troops, but soon, reinforcements consisting of 3,700 infantrymen and 250 cavalrymen arrived from Sweden. The Finnish nobility had also been engaged in the war, contributing with its cavalry. The goal of the Swedish-Finnish troops was to conquer Oreshek, Korela and Koporye. The siege of Oreshek was badly planned by the Swedish side and failed since the Russians had destroyed the areas surrounding the town and the Swedish troops had insufficient supplies to be able to maintain the siege until the town surrendered. While admiral Johan Brigge besieged and bombarded Oreshek, the Swedish diplomats tried to find support for their cause in Livonia, Poland-Lithuania and England. Early the following year, 1556, Russia made a new attack, this time with an army almost 20,000 men strong. The attack was aimed at the town of Viborg , and the Swedish troops were unlikely to withstand an army of that considerable size. However, after a few days of pillaging in the area around Viborg, the Russian forces left. The reason for this has not been made clear. Conceivable reasons might be bad discipline or a raging disease among the Russian soldiers. Perhaps it was never the aim to conquer Viborg, only to ravage the areas surrounding the town as a demonstration of power.

The shortest proposed route would be 126 kilometers--more than twice the length of the English Channel Tunnel.And the longest proposed route would be 207 kilometers. A recent conference in xiamen,Fujian Province brought together more than 70 experts.The event was cosponsored by universities from Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.Fujian is the province where both proposed mutes would begin. There is no direct passenger access between the mainland and Taiwan by air or sea at the moment. Experts say that it is better to start research sooner rather than later,although there is a lack of government funding .There are no technical problems t0 build a Taiwan tunnel.But it will require an improved political relationship across the Straits. A professor of TsinghHa University said,\\"A special feature of huge projects is that the period of preparation is longer than the period of construction.\\" For example,he said,the English channel Tunnel took 14 years of planning and had been discussed for two centuries.And preparations for the huge Three Corges dam on the Yangze River began in the 1950s. The xiamen conference focused on the longest southern route,which would use the Taiwan-controlled islands of Jinmen and Penghu as steppingstones. The first stage of the new project could be a bridge to cross the five kilometers between Xiamen and Jinmen.This would mean that traveling from Xiamen to Jinmen by car would only take five minutes.

EBC) unites autonomous Roman Catholic Benedictine communities of monks and nuns and is technically among the oldest of the 18 congregations that are affiliated in the Benedictine Confederation (the oldest being the Camaldolese). - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition. - A tithe (from Old English: \\"teogo√æa\\" \\"tenth\\") is a one-tenth part of something, paid as a contribution to a religious organization or compulsory tax to government. Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes. - Downside School is a co-educational Catholic independent school for children aged 11 to 18, located in Stratton-on-the-Fosse, between Westfield and Shepton Mallet in Somerset, south west England, attached to Downside Abbey.

It is part of the ceremonial county of Somerset. - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented. - The Mendip Hills (commonly called the Mendips) is a range of limestone hills to the south of Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. Running east to west between Weston-super-Mare and Frome, the hills overlook the Somerset Levels to the south and the Chew Valley and other tributaries of the Avon to the north. The hills give their name to the local government district of Mendip, which administers most of the area. The higher, western part of the hills, covering has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), which gives it a level of protection comparable to a national park. - Norton Radstock is the former name of the small conurbation covering Midsomer Norton, Radstock and Westfield, in the English ceremonial county of Somerset. It was formerly a large civil parish in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, south west of Bath, and the same distance north west of Frome.

It consisted of the towns of Midsomer Norton and Radstock and the parish of Westfield. The parish was north of the Mendip Hills. It included the smaller settlements of Clandown, Westfield and Haydon. Following a Governance Review in 2010, it was abolished in 2011 and replaced by three smaller councils. - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement. - A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Radstock is a town in Somerset, England, south west of Bath, and north west of Frome.

Located at the eastern end of the Mendip Hills, the town is built on uneven high ground, and centres on the River Frome. The town is approximately south of Bath, east of the county town, Taunton and west of London. In the 2011 census, the population was given as 26,203. The town is in the Mendip district of Somerset and is part of the parliamentary constituency of Somerton and Frome. - A tithe barn was a type of barn used in much of northern Europe in the Middle Ages for storing rents and tithes one tenth of a farm's produce which was given to the Church. Tithe barns were usually associated with the village church or rectory and independent farmers took their tithes there. The village priests would not have to pay tithesthe purpose of the tithe being their supportand some had their own farms anyway, which are now village greens in some villages. - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government. - Somerset is a county in South West England which borders Gloucestershire and Bristol to the north, Wiltshire to the east, Dorset to the south-east and Devon to the south-west. It is bounded to the north and west by the Severn Estuary and the Bristol Channel, its coastline facing southeastern Wales. Its traditional border with Gloucestershire is the River Avon. Somerset's county town is Taunton. - Midsomer Norton is a town near the Mendip Hills in Bath & North East Somerset, England, south-west of Bath, north-east of Wells, north-west of Frome, and south-east of Bristol.

Write the answer: Who was killed when a helicopter crashed in dense fog on 27 August 1990 in East Troy, Wisconsin?","completion":"The individual tragically killed in the helicopter crash on 27 August 1990 in East Troy, Wisconsin was the highly acclaimed blues-rock guitarist, singer, songwriter, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Vaughan, one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s, was just 35 years old at the time of his death. Born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, Stevie Ray Vaughan had become an iconic figure in the music industry. He was widely known for his expressive singing and impressive guitar playing, which were profoundly infused with jazz, rock, and country musical idioms, yet firmly rooted in the blues. Stevie Ray Vaughan and his backing band Double Trouble had just finished their concert performance at the Alpine Valley Music Theater alongside Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and his older brother, Jimmie Vaughan. Stevie was part of a group that was boarding the helicopter for a short-hop flight to their next tour location in Chicago. In the wee hours of August 27, 1990, the helicopter carrying Vaughan and four others struck concern when it did not reach its destination. They departed in dense fog and limited visibility, and sadly, the aircraft collided with a ski slope. All aboard were killed instantly, including the pilot, Jeffrey Browne; Vaughan's agent, Bobby Brooks; bodyguard, Nigel Browne; and tour manager, Colin Smythe, in addition to Vaughan himself. It was later determined that the pilot was not certified to navigate solely by the helicopter‚Äôs instruments, an essential competency in low-visibility conditions like those they were operating under that dreadful night. Vaughan's death was a massive shock for the music world. He was just beginning to find mainstream success after years of hard work. His death was met with tremendous sorrow from fans and fellow musicians alike. Stevie Ray Vaughan will always be remembered as one of the great pioneers of blues music. Vaughan and his contributions to music were honored with varied awards and recognitions, including induction into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000, and then in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. He was also named the 12th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. His music continues to inspire and influence countless musicians and has left an indelible mark on the world of blues and rock music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: National Review columnist John Derbyshire doesn't write the most racist stuff on the Internet -- not even close! But Derbyshire does effectively demonstrate, year after year, exactly how racist you can be and still get published by people who consider themselves intellectuals. Derbyshire has shocked the internet -- even the conservative internet -- with an essay for Taki's Magazine about how he had a talk with his children warning them about the danger of running into black people in public places and the necessity of befriending the few nice ones out there for the public relations benefits. Gawker's Maureen O'Connor asks, \\"How can John Derbyshire even have a career?\\" The reason is because John Derbyshire is very valuable. [Update: On Saturday evening, National Review editor Rich Lowry announced that the publication was severing its relationship with Derbyshire. \\"His latest provocation, in a webzine, lurches from the politically incorrect to the nasty and indefensible. We never would have published it, but the main reason that people noticed it is that it is by a National Review writer,\\" he writes. \\"Derb has long danced around the line on these issues, but this column is so outlandish it constitutes a kind of letter of resignation. It‚Äôs a free country, and Derb can write whatever he wants, wherever he wants. Just not in the pages of NR or NRO, or as someone associated with NR any longer.\\"] Or at least up to now he has been. On Friday, fellow National Review contributor Josh Barro, writing for Forbes, is shocked that Derbyshire hasn't been fired yet. In the last hour or so, more of his National Review colleagues have been criticizing the piece. Responding to The Atlantic's Matt O'Brien's question on Twitter, \\"Does @NRO want to be associated with someone who publishes racist trash like this?\\" senior editor Ramesh Ponnuru responded, \\"I know I don't.\\" And Jonah Goldberg, the editor of National Review Online, tweeted, \\"For the record, I find my colleague John Derbyshire's piece fundamentally indefensible and offensive. I wish he hadn't written it.\\" But that has not been the case with Derbyshire's body of work up to now. And we have a theory why: The truth about intellectual magazines is that not all of their readers are as enlightened and forward-thinking and clear-eyed as the people who produce them imagine themselves to be. So the trick to pull off is how to give what those less enlightened readers want -- and thereby secure their money either through subscriptions or contributions -- while still maintaining an air of respectability. Think of how your PBS station always trots out the stars-of-the-1970s concerts and River Dance whenever pledge drive comes around. That's where Derbyshire comes in. You're probably familiar with the phrase, \\"No offense, but‚Ä¶\\" which always precedes something offensive wrapped in an \\"I'm just telling it like it is\\" attitude. In certain parts of the country, there's a similar use of the phrase, \\"I'm not racist, but‚Ä¶\\" which always signifies that the speaker is about to say something racist. Derbyshire's specialty is the fancy-pants version of \\"I'm not racist, but‚Ä¶\\" In his latest essay, \\"The Talk: Nonblack Version,\\" Derbyshire lists several key \\"fact\\"s that he thinks his kid should know. Among them: (9) A small cohort of blacks‚Äîin my experience, around five percent‚Äîis ferociously hostile to whites and will go to great lengths to inconvenience or harm us. A much larger cohort of blacks‚Äîaround half‚Äîwill go along passively if the five percent take leadership in some event. They will do this out of racial solidarity, the natural willingness of most human beings to be led, and a vague feeling that whites have it coming. (10) Thus, while always attentive to the particular qualities of individuals, on the many occasions where you have nothing to guide you but knowledge of those mean differences, use statistical common sense: (10a) Avoid concentrations of blacks not all known to you personally. (10b) Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods. (10c) If planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date (neglect of that one got me the closest I have ever gotten to death by gunshot). (10d) Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks. (10e) If you are at some public event at which the number of blacks suddenly swells, leave as quickly as possible. To present himself as a cool social scientist, every single bullet point contains a link to some sort of source based in facts. The one about not going to a theme park where there's a ton of black people is a New York Times story from 1987. The implication is that Derbyshire was close by when a shooting occurred. (Obviously he was not actually injured, or we'd never hear the end of it.) This is how he's able to give the most dated racial stereotypes the veneer of respectability. Derbyshire doesn't do the really obvious racist stuff -- the stuff that goes up at FreeRepublic.com, for example -- like post photos Obama in stereotypical tribal garb with a bone through his nose. Instead, he talks about how his East African parentage means he might be suspect to some black voters, who are more likely to be of West African heritage. From June 19, 2008: Obama‚Äôs East African origins don‚Äôt help. Most black Americans take their African descent from West Africa. The distribution of physical types in East Africa is considerably different... There is of course a lot of overlap, but enough difference in physical types to give Obama a tinge of strangeness. The minds of many nonblack voters ‚Äî and perhaps some black ones, too ‚Äî will contain, at some level well below the surface, a thought like: He‚Äôs a black guy, but is he one of OUR black guys? Derbyshire doesn't say that black people, especially women, are pathetically stupid people doomed to live on the dole (For a good example of that, check out the 1941 Looney Tunes cartoon Coal Black and the Sebben Dwarfs.) Instead, he says that the black women who work at the DMV are mean and stupid because they're genetically destined to be so. From his recent essay: The mean intelligence of blacks is much lower than for whites. The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; forty percent of blacks have IQs that low... There is a magnifying effect here, too, caused by affirmative action. In a pure meritocracy there would be very low proportions of blacks in cognitively demanding jobs. Because of affirmative action, the proportions are higher. In government work, they are very high... ‚ÄúThe DMV lady‚Äú is a statistical truth, not a myth. Derbyshire does not call Obama a hustler who has hoodwinked gullible whites. Instead, when he implies Obama is a product of Affirmative Action, he presents it as a sendup of uppity liberals consumed by white guilt. On Obama's background, November 5, 2008: He was a red-diaper baby, offspring of a love-the-world, hate-America sixties gal and an African socialist in the Mugabe mould, raised by leftish grandparents addled with ‚ÄúUncle Tim‚Äù racial guilt, and mentored by a hard-Left labor radical. On how far you can go if you're black and smart, from this week's essay: Unfortunately the demand is greater than the supply, so IWSBs are something of a luxury good, like antique furniture or corporate jets: boasted of by upper-class whites and wealthy organizations, coveted by the less prosperous. To be an IWSB in present-day US society is a height of felicity rarely before attained by any group of human beings in history. \\"Height of felicity\\" links to Obama's page at WhiteHouse.gov, naturally. On how white folks' silly political correctness means you can't study racial theory anymore, from May 24, 2004: Whole areas of academic inquiry are now out of bounds in America, for fear of what they might uncover about human nature. The human sciences are nowadays radioactive, like history or philosophy in a Communist country. Entire disciplines have ceased to exist. Physical anthropology, for example: An informative and interesting book like Carleton Coon's Races of Man could not be published nowadays. The topic is too \\"dangerous\\" and \\"insensitive.\\" Safer to go into a solid, non-controversial field: Women's Studies, perhaps, or Queer Legal Theory. And on how some easily-influenced whites will vote for a black president because the movies have conditioned them to want one. From June 19, 2008: Working in combination with other factors that I‚Äôll get to, Obama‚Äôs n√©gritude will help him with a lot of politically vague types who are neither black nor distinctively liberal, but who have been oriented the Obama way by decades of watching Numinous Negro types saving the world, or defying it with a supernatural level of dignity and gravitas, in the movies and on TV: characters played by Will Smith, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Michael Clarke Duncan, Denzel Washington, and of course the numinousest of them all, Morgan Freeman. There is probably now an entire demographic cohort of young Americans whose mental image of God is Morgan Freeman. But most important, Derbyshire lends credibility to the sense of white grievance -- that white people are the real victims of racism. He doesn't use the language Ron Paul did in his racist old newsletters, which painted a vivid picture of packs of black thugs marauding cities and infecting white women with HIV for the sheer fun of it. That was specifically to appeal to rednecks. Derbyshire is classier than that. On how we're really paying slavery reparations already -- with welfare, on August 11, 2011: Following the black riots of the 1960s, non-blacks have seen these concessions as an implicit contract or treaty‚Äîas non-black America saying to black America: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll give you this stuff if you promise not to break our windows.‚Äù Or from this week's essay: These differences are magnified by the hostility many blacks feel toward whites. Thus, while black-on-black behavior is more antisocial in the average than is white-on-white behavior, average black-on-white behavior is a degree more antisocial yet. Race-baiting is getting harder and harder to do while holding onto your job. So, who knows, maybe this will be the piece that finally costs Derbyshire his. If it is, he will no doubt be surprised after such a long career of writing outrageously racist things. He's served, for all the aspiring race-baiters out there, as the model for how it's done.

Elspeth Reeve ||||| There is much talk about ‚Äú¬Ä¬úthe talk.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù ‚Äú¬Ä¬úSean O‚ÄôReilly was 16 when his mother gave him the talk that most black parents give their teenage sons,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù Denisa R. Superville of the Hackensack (NJ) Record tells us. Meanwhile, down in Atlanta: ‚Äú¬Ä¬úHer sons were 12 and 8 when Marlyn Tillman realized it was time for her to have the talk,‚Äù¬Ä¬ù Gracie Bonds Staples writes in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Leonard Greene talks about the talk in the New York Post. Someone bylined as KJ Dell‚ÄôAntonia talks about the talk in The New York Times. Darryl Owens talks about the talk in the Orlando Sentinel. Yes, talk about the talk is all over. There is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too. My own kids, now 19 and 16, have had it in bits and pieces as subtopics have arisen. If I were to assemble it into a single talk, it would look something like the following. * * * * * * * * * * * * * (1) Among your fellow citizens are forty million who identify as black, and whom I shall refer to as black. The cumbersome (and MLK-noncompliant) term ‚Äú¬Ä¬úAfrican-American‚Äù¬Ä¬ù seems to be in decline, thank goodness. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úColored‚Äú¬Ä¬ù and ‚Äú¬Ä¬úNegro‚Äú¬Ä¬ù are archaisms. What you must call ‚Äú¬Ä¬úthe ‚Äú¬Ä¬òN‚Äù¬Ä¬ô word‚Äù¬Ä¬ù is used freely among blacks but is taboo to nonblacks. ‚Äú¬Ä¬úThere is a talk that nonblack Americans have with their kids, too.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù (2) American blacks are descended from West African populations, with some white and aboriginal-American admixture. The overall average of non-African admixture is 20-25 percent. The admixture distribution is nonlinear, though: ‚Äú¬Ä¬úIt seems that around 10 percent of the African American population is more than half European in ancestry.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù (Same link.) (3) Your own ancestry is mixed north-European and northeast-Asian, but blacks will take you to be white. (4) The default principle in everyday personal encounters is, that as a fellow citizen, with the same rights and obligations as yourself, any individual black is entitled to the same courtesies you would extend to a nonblack citizen. That is basic good manners and good citizenship. In some unusual circumstances, however‚Äù¬Ä¬îe.g., paragraph (10h) below‚Äù¬Ä¬îthis default principle should be overridden by considerations of personal safety. (5) As with any population of such a size, there is great variation among blacks in every human trait (except, obviously, the trait of identifying oneself as black). They come fat, thin, tall, short, dumb, smart, introverted, extroverted, honest, crooked, athletic, sedentary, fastidious, sloppy, amiable, and obnoxious. There are black geniuses and black morons. There are black saints and black psychopaths. In a population of forty million, you will find almost any human type. Only at the far, far extremes of certain traits are there absences. There are, for example, no black Fields Medal winners. While this is civilizationally consequential, it will not likely ever be important to you personally. Most people live and die without ever meeting (or wishing to meet) a Fields Medal winner. (6) As you go through life, however, you will experience an ever larger number of encounters with black Americans. Assuming your encounters are random‚Äù¬Ä¬îfor example, not restricted only to black convicted murderers or to black investment bankers‚Äù¬Ä¬îthe Law of Large Numbers will inevitably kick in. You will observe that the means‚Äù¬Ä¬îthe averages‚Äù¬Ä¬îof many traits are very different for black and white Americans, as has been confirmed by methodical inquiries in the human sciences. (7) Of most importance to your personal safety are the very different means for antisocial behavior, which you will see reflected in, for instance, school disciplinary measures, political corruption, and criminal convictions.

And on Monday, he complained that some people had called him a bigot for writing the column. (Note: I have contributed periodically to National Review and National Review Online.) I disagree with Lowry‚Äôs piece, but I certainly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bigoted. Here, I originally had a few hundred words about why, but that‚Äôs not really the core point of this post; I‚Äôve appended my discussion of the Lowry column at the bottom if you‚Äôre interested. It suffices to say that Lowry ought to be able to make these points without being called a bigot, even though I think he‚Äôs wrong. But Lowry is running into the problem I discussed last week: he‚Äôs probably getting called a bigot because of the company he keeps. Providing a great example, this week National Review writer John Derbyshire published a kind of unbelievably racist piece for Taki‚Äôs Magazine, describing ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù he gives to his children. In the wake of the Trayvon Martin‚Äôs shooting, many black parents have discussed the advice they give to their male children about not getting themselves shot in a misunderstanding with a white authority figure. Derbyshire‚Äôs talk, on the other hand, is about how to avoid being harmed by a black person. He gives such advice as ‚ÄúIf planning a trip to a beach or amusement park at some date, find out whether it is likely to be swamped with blacks on that date,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you are at some public event at which the number of blacks suddenly swells, leave as quickly as possible.‚Äù Derbyshire also recommends befriending some ‚Äúintelligent and well-socialized blacks‚Äù (IWSBs, for short) so that you can deflect charges of racism by noting that some of your best friends are black. Alas, he adds ‚Äúthe demand is greater than the supply, so IWSBs are something of a luxury good, like antique furniture or corporate jets: boasted of by upper-class whites and wealthy organizations, coveted by the less prosperous.‚Äù So, while Lowry is advising blacks not to worry so much about the systematic profiling of blacks as criminals due to their race, his colleague Derbyshire is writing a piece specifically urging white people to engage in such profiling, among various other racist nonsense. And this is the problem for Lowry and other conservatives who want to be taken seriously by broad audiences when they write about racial issues. Lowry wrote a column containing advice for black Americans. Why should black Americans take him seriously while he‚Äôs employing Derbyshire? If Lowry wants NR to be credible on race, he should start by firing John Derbyshire. As for my substantive take on Lowry‚Äôs column? It isn‚Äôt bigoted, though it does set up a false dichotomy. Why shouldn‚Äôt black Americans concern themselves with black-on-black crime and also with the mistreatment of innocent black men by authorities? Indeed, I think if you look closely at the politics of heavily black jurisdictions in America today, voters do care about both of those things. Lowry‚Äôs first example in his column is a young black man shot for no reason in his Detroit home in February. He complains that there is no national outrage over this, but he doesn‚Äôt note that the Detroit Police Department under Mayor Dave Bing‚Äôs administration has brought in outside experts to import policing best practices from places like New York in an effort to reduce violent crime. Reducing violent crime is absolutely high on the political agenda in Detroit. It‚Äôs just that different problems have different solutions. The problem in Sanford was that the police department wasn‚Äôt properly handling the investigation of Martin‚Äôs death, and public pressure was a useful tool to bring about intervention from the state and federal governments to improve the case‚Äôs handling. Fixing Detroit‚Äôs crime problems will require a more bottom-up solution, and the fact that there isn‚Äôt a national outcry doesn‚Äôt mean that the problem isn‚Äôt being taken seriously. Indeed, while the sharp drop in violent crime over the last two decades has had many causes, it partly reflects the fact that voters and politicians have placed greater emphasis on fighting crime than they used to. In large American cities, that very often means black elected officials and black voters. Lowry also ends the piece with this: [George] Zimmerman could be arrested, convicted, and hanged tomorrow, and it will have no effect on the lives of young black people in communities beset by social disorder. Whatever happens to Zimmerman, the drip-drip of spilled blood will continue, all but ignored except in the police blotter. In America, the lives of young black people are cheap, unless they happen to fit the right agenda. This is missing the point. The broader complaint in the Martin case is that young black men are suspected of crimes for no reason other than their race, leading to unwarranted seizures and arrests and, in some rare cases like this one, tragic deaths. And a further problem is that the non-investigation of Zimmerman (whose clothes were not even retained as evidence by the Sanford Police) sends the message that there is no consequence for killing a young black man due to a misunderstanding. It‚Äôs a perfectly valid complaint about the rule of law, and doesn‚Äôt negate Lowry‚Äôs point that black-on-black violence is an important problem. ||||| Summary:","completion":"There is a journalist named John Derbyshire who wrote some articles that people think are racist.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who has a boyfriend named Hans? ? Tom Stansfield is a researcher at a publishing company who works under the tyrannical Jack Taylor. Tom has a crush on his boss' daughter, Lisa, who is completely controlled by her overprotective father. She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees. A comedy of errors ensues, including the return of Lisa's older brother, Red, on the run from drug dealers. Red dumps drugs into the toilet, and instead returns a bag of flour to the drug dealer.

Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him.

Answer the following question: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job. However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs. Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university. The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing. Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy. In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. What did a college degree mean to people in the past? A) It was a proof of their professional skills.

Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name. - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair. - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor . - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Ta√≠no \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world. - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and Le√≥n. - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour. - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns. - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO. - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family. - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.

One of the first things you'll do when you begin to cook is actually turn on your grill. Regardless of what type of grill you have, you'll need to let the grill get nice and hot in order to start cooking.","completion":"However, this process could potentially create some hazards if not done correctly. To avoid any safety issues, there are several key steps you should follow when heating and starting your grill. 1. Read your grill's user manual: Before attempting to use any grill, make sure you have read and understood the user manual that came with the device. This will provide you with essential information on the safe operation of your specific grill model. 2. Inspect your grill before use: Regularly check your grill for any signs of damage, wear, or corrosion. Issues like broken parts, leaks, or rust can pose significant dangers. Addressing any issues before starting the grill will ensure it operates safely and efficiently. 3. Set up your grill in a safe location: To avoid potential dangers, place your grill outdoors in a well-ventilated area, away from buildings, wooden decks, and combustible materials. Also, ensure that the grill is set up on a stable and non-flammable surface to minimize the risk of tipping over or catching fire. 4. Open the lid before igniting the grill: When starting the grill, make sure the lid is open. This prevents a dangerous buildup of gas that could potentially cause an explosion. 5. Use long-handled utensils and heat-resistant gloves: Cooking on a grill exposes you to a considerable amount of heat. Utilizing long-handled utensils and heat-resistant gloves will help keep a safe distance from the hot grill and prevent burns. 6. Light the grill before turning on the gas: If you‚Äôre using a gas grill, turn the control knob to the \\"off\\" position and open the propane tank valve. Then, follow the manufacturer's instructions for igniting the burners. This ensures that any excess gas has time to dissipate before lighting the grill. 7. Keep a fire extinguisher or other fire-suppression tools close by: Accidents can happen, so it's always better to be prepared with a fire extinguisher, bucket of sand, or a garden hose nearby, in case of any flare-ups or potential fires. 8. Never leave the grill unattended: Always keep a close eye on your grill while it's in use. Leaving the grill unattended can lead to dangerous situations, such as flare-ups or spilling of hot grease, which could potentially cause an uncontrollable fire. 9. Maintain a clean grill: Regular cleaning of your grill will not only ensure its longevity but also help prevent dangerous flare-ups caused by the accumulation of grease and food debris. 10. Let the grill cool down before moving or touching: When you've finished grilling, turn off the gas and let the grill cool down for a sufficient amount of time before moving or cleaning it. Touching or moving a hot grill could result in severe burns or accidents. By following these safety measures when using your grill, you can minimize the risks associated with grilling and ensure a safe and enjoyable cooking experience.

Article: Elon Musk just announced details of Tesla's plan to start pumping out lithium ion batteries like M&Ms at its planned \\"Gigafactory.\\" Obviously, it's big news for electric vehicles as this should bring down the cost of a very expensive component. But it has equal and possibly greater significance for renewable energy. We've explained that power storage is the key to unlocking widespread renewable energy. For renewables to be truly cost competitive with existing power sources, they need to be able to provide a continuous current flow, something difficult to achieve when the wind isn't blowing or sun isn't shining. But the price to do so is currently exorbitant. Tom Leyden, the head of Solar Grid Storage, whose revolutionary container storage system on the side of a Maryland freeway we profiled a few months ago, says batteries currently represent 50% of the cost of one of his systems. Which is why he's hailing Tesla's decision. \\"If those prices comes down, our market expands, we can offer a lower priced product and put more storage in our system,\\" he told us. \\"So this is very important.\\" Solar execs are comparing the current environment to where photovoltaic costs were in the last decade, just before their prices plummeted. \\"At that point in time solar modules were very expensive, and the industry was pushing a couple of different alternatives: thin films were going to be photovoltaic of the future,\\" said Tony Clifford, CEO of Standard Solar. His company also worked on the Maryland project. But thanks to worldwide government incentives, he said, the price of traditional silicon ended up falling through the floor, paving the way for the current renewables boom. In this case, of course, the marketplace is creating the demand for lithium ion batteries. But renewables will again be the beneficiaries. \\"You're going to be able to drive costs out right across supply chain and see some significant cost reductions in storage technology.\\" A report from the Rocky Mountain Institute released prior to Tesla's announcement (spotted by GTM) was even more extreme about the possibilities for cheaper storage. \\"Whereas other technologies, including solar PV and other distributed resources without storage, net metering, and energy efficiency still require some degree of grid dependence, solar-plus-batteries enable customers to cut the cord to their utility entirely,\\" they write. \\"The coming grid parity of solar-plus-battery systems in the foreseeable future, among other factors, signals the eventual demise of traditional utility business models,\\" the authors wrote. Tesla's announcement represents a major step towards a larger, cheaper energy storage market that could have huge implications for making renewables more widespread. NOW WATCH: Here's What Really Happens At A Tesla Supercharger Station &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Please enable Javascript to watch this video&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; ||||| Bloomberg News An attendee looking at a battery charger is reflected on a Tesla Motors Inc. Model S electric vehicle displayed at the 43rd Tokyo Motor Show 2013 in Tokyo. Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA:US)‚Äôs plan to build what co-founder Elon Musk bills as the world‚Äôs largest battery factory could shake up the power industry and trigger a bidding contest between states eager for the 6,500 jobs the 5 billion investment could create. The luxury electric-car maker announced yesterday that it‚Äôs selling at least 1.6 billion of convertible notes to finance the project and exploring locations in Texas, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico for a 10 million-square-foot facility. Tesla declined to comment on whether any negotiations had begun. ‚ÄúThis would rank as the most attractive industrial project out there,‚Äù said Dennis Cuneo, president of DC Strategic Advisors LLC and a former Toyota Motor Corp. executive who helped that carmaker select manufacturing sites. Tesla has dubbed the project the ‚Äúgigafactory,‚Äù and it would make Musk a force in both U.S. manufacturing and electric power. The plant he envisions would have more capacity than any other to make lithium-ion batteries. ‚ÄúThis has a huge impact beyond Tesla,‚Äù said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ‚ÄúIt gives enormous legitimacy to battery production and the future of the electric car because that lies in the battery. It‚Äôs high stakes, high technology.‚Äù Tesla plans an investment of 4 billion to 5 billion by 2020 and will fund about 2 billion of the total, the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a presentation on its website. The convertible bond offering could grow to 1.84 billion, according to a separate statement. Power Storage The plant is key to Tesla becoming a mass-market automaker capable of producing 500,000 or more electric vehicles a year from a projected 35,000 this year, Musk has said. Its cheapest vehicle, the Model S, starts at 71,000. The 42-year-old billionaire could also get closer to achieving his goal of being a leader in the power-storage industry in the U.S., as utility customers continue to turn to batteries and solar panels to reduce electricity bills. The scale of production at the planned factory would be so immense that Tesla estimates it would drive down lithium-ion battery costs by at least 30 percent. That possibility for batteries capable of storing large amounts of electricity from wind, solar and other renewable sources is what makes the project appealing, said James Albertine, an equity analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., who rates Tesla a hold. Tesla rose 2.5 percent to 259.30 at 9:55 a.m. New York time. ‚ÄúOn the vehicle side, I am pretty steadfast in my skepticism at 200 or above. I‚Äôm a bear,‚Äù Albertine said. ‚ÄúMy bull case is in the case that the cars become ancillary.‚Äù ‚ÄòRobust Competition‚Äô Tesla, he said, would essentially become a power storage company. That would benefit SolarCity Corp., which is partly owned by Musk and may be a partner in the factory. Musk said last week that Panasonic Corp. (6752) -- now the biggest supplier of lithium-ion cells used in Tesla‚Äôs batteries -- may also be involved. Panasonic‚Äôs participation is ‚Äúnot 100 percent confirmed,‚Äù he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. While Tesla identified only four states as potential hosts, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to draw interest from many others,‚Äù Cuneo said. He predicted a ‚Äúrobust competition‚Äù where ‚Äúincentives are probably going to be a big factor.‚Äù A slide-show on the Tesla website includes a rendering of the facility in a desert landscape, with adjacent solar and wind farms to supply electricity. Construction could begin as early as this year, according to the presentation. ‚ÄúWithout question there will be a very intense bidding war -- 5 billion is a breathtaking figure,‚Äù Shaiken said. States want the jobs and ‚Äúalso the research and development related to this. That‚Äôs going to be very significant.‚Äù Up Sevenfold Tesla announced the fundraising and plans for the gigafactory after the shares closed at their highest since the company‚Äôs initial public offering in June 2010. They‚Äôve gone up sevenfold in the past year. The company will offer 800 million of notes due 2019 and 800 million due 2021. The company plans to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase as much as an additional 120 million due 2019, and an additional 120 million, due 2021, bringing the offering to as much as 1.84 billion. The coupon, conversion rate and other terms of the notes haven‚Äôt been determined, according to the statement. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG are jointly managing the offering, the company said. Previous Surge Proceeds from the note sale will also be used to produce a ‚ÄúGen III‚Äù vehicle that‚Äôs cheaper than the Model S sedan. The offering will also accelerate growth of Tesla‚Äôs business in the U.S. and overseas, as the company prepares to enter China next month. The fundraising move echoes Tesla‚Äôs sale of 1.08 billion of new shares and notes in May 2013 amid a previous surge in the company‚Äôs shares. ‚ÄúObviously, they understand the need to strike while the iron is hot,‚Äù said Alan Baum, an analyst at Baum & Associates in West Bloomfield, Michigan, who tracks alternative-powertrain technologies. ‚ÄúWhat they are doing is taking advantage of being looked at as a different kind of company.‚Äù To contact the reporter on this story: Alan Ohnsman in Los Angeles at aohnsman@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jamie Butters at jbutters@bloomberg.net ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: - Slash pages from every domain on the web: -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph |||||Summary:","completion":"Tesla's announcement to start producing lithium-ion batteries at its planned \\"Gigafactory\\" is big news for electric vehicles, as this should bring down the cost of a very expensive component.

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city. My eyes darted from color to color, sign to sign, connection to connection. I floated like a ghost and thought about crying. There were few people out so I found a relative ease in that but my mind still jumped around reckless. I needed to find Kim. I saw a silent pay phone with a dangling phonebook and headed towards it until I remembered that phone books don't normally list cell phones. Kim wasn't the type of girl to list herself in the phonebook either. I had no leads but I knew I could go to a library and maybe find out her number if she had listed it on Facebook, so I kept walking.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- A 2-year-old boy and his mother have been found dead inside a Massachusetts trash bin, leaving authorities Monday to track down whomever killed the two and put them there. Police discovered Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela, 25, and her toddler son Brian Palaguachi dead in the large metal bin Sunday night in the city of Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston. Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz did not identify any suspects in the pair's killings Monday, though he did say their deaths are not a \\"random act.\\" \\"We do not believe (there) is a general threat to public safety and the community,\\" Cruz told reporters. \\"However, this investigation is focusing on an individual who has murdered a mother and her young child.\\" The investigation began Sunday around 9:30 p.m. when Brockton police got an anonymous call about a body inside a bin behind the building where","completion":"the Palaguachi family lived. Officers immediately responded to the scene and discovered the lifeless bodies of Palaguachi-Cela and little Brian in the trash container, appearing to have been brutally killed. The area was quickly cordoned off as a crime scene, and forensic experts began combing the area for evidence that could lead to the apprehension of the person or persons responsible. As the search for the murderer intensified, authorities canvassed the neighborhood, interviewing residents and gathering surveillance footage from nearby businesses and security systems. The trash bin and surrounding area were searched for any potential clues, including fingerprints, DNA samples, and distinctive items which might help identify the perpetrator. An autopsy was performed on the victims, revealing that they both had died from a combination of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. It was unclear how long their bodies had been in the dumpster before they were found, but investigators determined that they had been killed within 48 hours of being discovered. Detectives began to piece together a profile of the possible murderer, first conducting a thorough background check on the two victims, as well as their known associates. Delving into Palaguachi-Cela's personal life, it emerged that she had recently been involved in a tumultuous relationship and was in the process of separating from her partner. Investigators sought to establish whether this could be the motive behind the deaths. As authorities investigated further, they held press conferences, releasing details about the case and asking for the public's help in identifying anyone who may have had contact with the victims in the days prior to their deaths. Community members were urged to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or information related to the case. In the meantime, social media began to play a crucial role in the investigation. Friends and acquaintances of the deceased shared their shock, grief, and memories online, as well as spreading awareness and urging anyone with knowledge of the crime to come forward. The heartbreaking story garnered widespread attention, and the hashtag #JusticeForMariaAndBrian started trending on various platforms. Based on various leads gathered from forensic evidence, interviews, and tips from the public, investigators were gradually able to narrow down the list of potential suspects. In the following days, the police ‚Äì along with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies ‚Äì searched the residences and vehicles of persons of interest, looking for further clues or evidence linking them to the crime. Eventually, a breakthrough was made when a piece of vital evidence was uncovered, implicating a particular individual in the brutal murders. With sufficient evidence, an arrest warrant was issued for the suspect. The apprehension of the main suspect was made, followed by a swift and thorough interrogation to determine the motive behind the crime and, if necessary, the involvement of any co-conspirators. The Plymouth County District Attorney's Office would then proceed to file appropriate charges against the accused, ensuring that justice would be served for Maria Avelina Palaguachi-Cela and her young son, Brian Palaguachi. As the case proceeded through the judicial system, the community rallied to support the surviving family members, offering emotional and financial assistance in their time of need. In the end, the most logical way to complete this passage is to detail the diligent efforts of law enforcement and the community in bringing the perpetrator to justice, and to portray how a senseless, brutal crime forever changed the lives of a grieving family in Brockton, Massachusetts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: As any homemaker who has tried to keep order at the dinner table knows, there is far more to a family meal than food. Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families to find out just how much more. Lewis and his co-worker carried out their study by videotaping the families while they are having ordinary meals in their own homes. They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children. But as the number of children gets larger,conversation gives way to the parents' efforts to control the loud noise they make. That can have an important effect on the children. \\"In general the more question-asking the parents do, the higher the children's IQ scores,\\"Lewis says. \\" And the more children there are, the less question-asking there is. \\" The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings .

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What college is the only project Austen Harrison ever did in Britain?, using the article: Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end..., what would be the answer ?

All are volunteers for hazardous service, the sort of man of which Thompson is openly skeptical. Stringer begins by interviewing the men, one at a time, asking, \\"Why did you volunteer for hazardous service?\\" He throws out many obvious rejects and then tests the rest by dropping them by parachute 300 miles north, dressed in German uniforms with neither money nor ID, and telling them to get back to barracks in 48 hours. Eight of the men make it back, and they are the final selection.Stringer now has his crew--but the friction between him and Thompson only grows, because Stringer's methods grate on Thompson's professional sensibilities. The appalling lack of discipline of the men irk Thompson even more, but Stringer insists on doing things \\"his\\" way.Then comes an exercise to attempt to penetrate the Thames--and not a man reaches his objective, and all of them get picked up within hours.

Consider hosting a charity event.","completion":"Title: Enhancing Workplace Culture: Office Potlucks, Sports Leagues, and Charity Events Introduction: Creating a Positive Work Environment A positive workplace culture is the backbone of a thriving organization. Happy employees are statistically more productive, engaged, and less likely to seek new job opportunities. Employers looking to foster camaraderie, cultivate a sense of loyalty, and enhance the overall workplace experience should consider introducing creative initiatives that promote interpersonal connections, collaboration, and a sense of togetherness. Three such initiatives are office potlucks, sports leagues, and charity events. These activities have the potential to unite employees, create lasting memories, and even give back to the community. 1) Host Office Potlucks: Building Bonds Through Shared Meals Office potlucks offer a unique way to connect employees through their love of food and shared culinary experiences. By inviting coworkers to come together and bring a homemade dish to share, employers can create a relaxed and enjoyable environment that promotes interactions among colleagues, transcending hierarchical barriers. Moreover, potlucks provide opportunities for individuals to share their heritage, cultures, and stories through diverse food offerings, facilitating a deeper understanding and appreciation among coworkers. This increased exposure to varied perspectives encourages innovative thinking and collaboration, two essential elements of a successful workplace culture. Lastly, potlucks can improve workplace morale by facilitating regular breaks from the stress of the workday, allowing employees to recharge their mental capacities. A well-fed, satisfied team is more likely to perform optimally and remain content in their roles. 2) Start a Sports League: Boosting Health and Morale through Team Sports Company-sponsored sports leagues serve as an effective avenue for promoting teamwork, communication, and interpersonal collaboration. By organizing a sports league within the office, employers encourage employees to engage in physical activity, socialize with colleagues beyond the scope of their jobs, and build a sense of camaraderie among teammates. The benefits of a sports league extend beyond improved interpersonal relationships. Regular exercise is known to boost mental health, reduce stress, enhance productivity, and lead to healthier lifestyle choices. Furthermore, office sports leagues often inspire a gentle competitive spirit, which can spur employees to perform optimally both on the field and in the office. Employers can make the sports league experience even more enjoyable by providing team uniforms, organizing games during lunch hours or after work, and recognizing the achievements of individual players. 3) Host a Charity Event: Giving Back, Together Charity events provide employees with opportunities to engage in acts of community service and volunteerism, fostering a sense of purpose and collective accomplishment. By organizing a charity event, employers demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility and encourage employees to work together towards a common goal, while benefiting the broader community. Hosting a charity event cultivates a powerful sense of unity among employees, further enhancing the workplace experience. Examples of popular charity events include food drives, blood donations, and charity walks or runs. In addition to benefiting the selected cause, employees gain team-building experience, form connections with their colleagues, and contribute positively to their organization's public image. Conclusion: Reap the Rewards of Strong Workplace Culture By nurturing a warm, inclusive, and socially engaged workplace culture, employers reap the rewards of improved morale, increased productivity, and a more dedicated, resilient workforce. Introducing activities such as office potlucks, sports leagues, and charity events fosters a sense of camaraderie and unity within the organization, ultimately contributing to its growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the best way to: How to determine where the shape begins and ends to make a knife on a piece of iron. OPT: 1). Draw the shape of the knife on the iron before you cut or grind the iron.; 2). Analyze a picture and visualize where you should start cutting and grinding the iron.; Answer:","completion":"The best way to determine where the shape begins and ends to make a knife on a piece of iron is: 1). Draw the shape of the knife on the iron before you cut or grind the iron. Step-by-step justification: Step 1: Select the appropriate piece of iron. Choose a piece of iron that is large enough to accommodate the entire knife shape, and has the necessary thickness and strength suitable for making a knife. Step 2: Determine the knife shape and design. Before drawing the shape on the iron, plan and decide on the knife shape, size, and design. This can be done by researching different knife styles, analyzing their usage, and understanding the proportions of the blade, handle, and other features. Step 3: Clean the iron surface. To ensure that the shape is drawn accurately on the iron, clean the surface properly. This helps to remove any dirt, rust, or oil, providing a clear surface on which to draw the shape. Step 4: Draw the shape of the knife on the iron. Using a suitable marking tool, such as a metal scribe or a fine-tipped permanent marker, carefully draw the shape of the knife on the iron. This should include outlines of the blade, handle, and any other features. The drawn shape will serve as a guideline during the cutting and grinding process. Step 5: Cut and grind the iron. Using the drawn shape as a reference, cut and grind the iron to match the outlined knife shape. This includes removing excess material, refining the edges, and shaping any additional features. Step 6: Finish the knife. After shaping the knife, finish it by polishing the surface, sharpening the blade, adding any necessary handle materials, and treating the metal if required. Drawing the shape of the knife on the iron before cutting and grinding ensures that the desired shape is achieved with accuracy while minimizing the risk of mistakes during the fabrication process. Analyzing a picture and visualizing where to cut and grind can be useful for obtaining inspiration or understanding the geometry of the knife, but it does not provide the same level of precision as physically drawing the shape directly on the iron."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \\"12345678\\"or \\"QWERTY\\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \\"I don't care\\", \\"Whatever\\", \\"I love you\\" or their opposite, \\"I hate you\\". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol. Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the perfect password is easy for you and hard for others. ,,.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: Who is the elder sister of Stella Kowalski in Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire?","completion":"In Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire, the elder sister of Stella Kowalski is Blanche DuBois. Blanche is a complex and intriguing character whose background, desires, and fears drive much of the action in the play. She is portrayed as a fading Southern belle, struggling to come to terms with her new surroundings and the harsh realities of life. Blanche DuBois is a fragile and neurotic woman who, after losing the family estate, Belle Reve, is forced to move in with her younger sister, Stella, and her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Blanche's character is rich with contradictions, as she displays both delicate refinement and an apparent lack of moral boundaries. The play explores the tense relationship between the two sisters, which is ultimately destructive to Blanche as she becomes increasingly detached from reality. Blanche's story is marked by tragedy and personal failures. After losing Belle Reve due to the family's financial mismanagement and the death of her remaining relatives, Blanche experiences a period of promiscuity and scandal. She is eventually forced to leave her job as an English teacher, as well as her hometown of Laurel, Mississippi, due to an inappropriate relationship with an underage student. These experiences contribute to her constant need for escapism, which she attempts to achieve through disguises, deceit, and creating fantasies about herself and her past. Throughout the play, Blanche struggles to maintain a fa√ßade of innocence, which only exacerbates her instability and makes her more vulnerable. This theme of appearance versus reality is crucial to understanding the character of Blanche DuBois, as she consistently tries to evade her troubled past and construct a new life for herself based on illusion and lies. Her ultimate downfall comes when her deception is exposed by Stanley Kowalski, who cannot tolerate her presence in his home and marriage any longer. He brutally exploits her weaknesses and takes advantage of her vulnerability. One of the fundamental triggers for Blanche's emotional turmoil is her nostalgia for a fading, idealized vision of the South's genteel, aristocratic past. As a character, Blanche embodies the conflicts that beset the former Southern upper class in the post-Civil-War era. She mourns the decline of the antebellum South and refuses to confront the harsh present, instead clinging to the remnants of a bygone era represented by her flirting, vanity, and need to be admired by men. In conclusion, Blanche DuBois serves as a fascinating and tragic character in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. She is Stella Kowalski's elder sister, a woman caught in the turmoil of her traumatized past and the clash between the Old South and a modern, industrialized society. As a deeply flawed and vulnerable individual, she ultimately cannot escape the consequences of her actions or adapt to her new circumstances, resulting in a devastating demise that emphasizes the power of nostalgia, illusion, and self-deception in defining human experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have this problem: -3205 * u + 388 * u = -84510 First, let's see if we can add those two amounts of u together.

So, we would have: -3205 + 388 = -2817 Now our problem looks like this: -2817 * u = -84510 To find u, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2817. When we do that, we have: u = -84510 / -2817 And now let's do the division. When you divide -84510 by -2817, you get: u = 30 So, the answer to our problem is u = 30.

After the second World Trade Center crash, Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental 767 jetliners that had departed Logan Airport. Remembering the \\"we have some planes\\" remark, Boston Center guessed that Delta 1989 might also be hijacked. Boston Center called NEADS at 9:41 and identified Delta 1989, a 767 jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas, as a possible hijack. NEADS warned the FAA's Cleveland Center to watch Delta 1989. The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too. During the course of the morning, there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft. The report of American 11 heading south was the first; Delta 1989 was the second. NEADS never lost track of Delta 1989, and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it. The flight never turned off its transponder. NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked, and tracked Delta 1989 as it reversed course over Toledo, headed east, and landed in Cleveland.

Translate to English English:","completion":"The rivers were covered with ice and therefore, men couldn't catch fish. In this sentence, the speaker is describing a situation where the rivers became frozen, forming a layer of ice on their surface. Due to this, the men who were supposed to engage in the activity of fishing couldn't do so. The formation of ice on water bodies, like rivers, is a common phenomenon that occurs during winter or in cold climates. When the temperature drops below the freezing point of water, the upper layers of water in rivers gradually transform into solid ice. As a result, the aquatic life forms, such as fish, become inaccessible, thus hindering fishing activities. In many parts of the world, fishing is an important source of livelihood and sustenance for numerous communities. Every year, fishermen all over the world anticipate the arrival of the most favorable season, in terms of climate and availability of fish, for this activity. In some locations where fishing is possible all year round, they can have permanent jobs as fishermen, while others are engaged in this occupation only seasonally. In the given situation, the formation of ice on rivers makes it difficult for fishermen to carry out their primary activity, which is fishing. The ice cover can vary in thickness and strength, depending on the duration of the freezing conditions and the geographical location of the river. When the ice is strong and thick enough, it can support humans and their equipment, opening an opportunity to engage in ice fishing. Ice fishing is a popular winter sport in some countries where rivers and lakes freeze over, such as Canada, Finland, Russia, and parts of the United States. However, ice fishing typically requires specific skills, tools, and safety measures different from those for fishing in open waters. Some of the essential tools required for ice fishing include ice augers, which are used to drill holes through the ice to access the water, and sleighs, to transport equipment to the fishing site. Fishermen also need specialized clothing to stay warm and protected in freezing conditions. To summarize, the statement \\"–†–µ–∫–∏ –ø–æ–∫—Ä—ã–ª–∏—Å—å –ª—å–¥–æ–º –∏ –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω—ã –Ω–µ –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –ª–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å —Ä—ã–±—É,\\" translated to English as \\"The rivers were covered with ice and therefore, men couldn't catch fish,\\" presents a scenario where freezing conditions have impeded fishing activities by creating an ice barrier on the surface of rivers. This situation can have significant impacts on the livelihoods of fishermen, as well as the regional economy, especially if fishing plays a vital role. However, the emergence of ice fishing can provide an alternative way of catching fish during the cold season for those equipped with the appropriate skills, tools, and precautions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: With government subsidies promised, initially at 385,000 a year, and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers, Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States' Mail Steamship Company, familiarly known as the Collins Line. He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program. The first of the four Collins Line ships, SS Atlantic, was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850. Her three sister ships, Pacific, Arctic and Baltic, were all in service before the end of 1850. The four, all constructed of wood, were broadly similar in size and performance; Arctic was marginally the largest, at 284 feet (87 m) in length and 2,856 tons by American custom house measurement. The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships, and were soon outperforming them; crossings in ten days became routine. Arctic entered service on October 26, 1850. The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens, who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard's Britannia in 1840. Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped, \\"a thoroughly hopeless, and profoundly preposterous box\\", while the bleak saloon was \\"a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse\\". In Arctic, according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger, her cabins \\"in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed\\", while the main saloon had \\"an air of almost Oriental magnificence\\".Under her captain, James Luce, a 49-year-old veteran of thirty years at sea, Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships. Her record eastbound crossing, from New York to Liverpool in nine days, seventeen hours in the winter of 1851‚Äì52, earned her the title of the \\"Clipper of the Seas\\". Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship; a reporter for Harper's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly: \\"If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic, you will find in the...

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Alexisonfire (pronounced \\"Alexis on fire\\") is a five-piece Canadian post-hardcore band that formed in St. Catharines, Ontario in 2001. The band consists of George Pettit (unclean vocals), Dallas Green (clean vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass guitar), and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). They describe their music as \\"the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight\\" (a reference to their song \\"A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles\\", also the inspiration for their debut album cover art). Alexisonfire had attracted considerable attention from major record labels, due to the success of their self-titled debut. However, when they started considering making a second album, the band felt that, for artistic reasons, they should remain independent, as it would give them better chances of developing and deciding their direction. They would remain with Distort Entertainment, and instead of using a famous producer, they recorded the album with Julius Butty at his studio near Hamilton, Ontario. Watch Out! was released on June 29, 2004, and was immediately successful. It debuted at No. 6 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200, and received gold certification in Canada in twelve weeks. The good critical reception came from the fact that the band was more focused from the eighteen months of touring, helping them harness more aggression, release more emotion, and fine-tune all the tracks. This lay in comparison to their debut album, which was mostly first drafts. On June 14, 2005 Alexisonfire posted a statement on their website revealing that founding drummer Jesse Ingelevics was leaving the band. The statement explained that the band and Ingelevics had slowly grown apart, and that he wanted to spend more time with his family and his fiancee. While touring in support of the album with Johnny Truant and The Blood Roses in Glasgow, Scotland in October 2005, each member of all three bands had the word \\"Yeti\\" tattooed on themselves. On an episode of the MuchMusic program The New Music, Pettit and Green revealed that the inspiration for their \\"Yeti\\" tattoos came from the 1988 Gary Oldman film The Firm. What happened with the second album?","completion":"When it was time to make their second album, the band Alexisonfire decided to stay independent for artistic reasons.

The album was successful, reached No. 6 on the Nielsen Soundscan Top 200, and got a gold certification in Canada in twelve weeks.

Context: There are many important organozinc compounds. Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. Among important applications is the Frankland-Duppa Reaction in which an oxalate ester(ROCOCOOR) reacts with an alkyl halide R'X, zinc and hydrochloric acid to the Œ±-hydroxycarboxylic esters RR'COHCOOR, the Reformatskii reaction which converts Œ±-halo-esters and aldehydes to Œ≤-hydroxy-esters, the Simmons‚ÄìSmith reaction in which the carbenoid (iodomethyl)zinc iodide reacts with alkene(or alkyne) and converts them to cyclopropane, the Addition reaction of organozinc compounds to carbonyl compounds. The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle. Commercially available diorganozinc compounds are dimethylzinc, diethylzinc and diphenylzinc. In one study the active organozinc compound is obtained from much cheaper organobromine precursors: A:","completion":"The organometallic precursor for the Barbier reaction is the organozinc compound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Question: Sammy was a union member. He had to be. It was the only way to advance in his profession. What was his profession? Options: - workplace - science - algebra - province - construction business Explain why a human would choose \\"construction business\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"construction business\\" to answer the question above because being a union member is more relevant and common in the construction business, compared to the other options provided. In the context of the question, it is mentioned that Sammy had to be a union member in order to advance in his profession. This suggests that his profession involves an industry where union membership plays a significant role in workers' career progress and opportunities. Unions are organizations that represent the collective interests of workers in specific industries, often negotiating for better wages, working conditions, and benefits. The construction business is particularly known for having strong unions, as workers in this field often face physically demanding tasks, hazardous working conditions, and varying employment situations. Thus, union representation is crucial in addressing these concerns and ensuring that construction workers receive fair treatment from employers. In contrast, the other options provided do not fit the same description. \\"Workplace\\" is a general term referring to the place where people work, rather than a specific profession. \\"Science\\" and \\"algebra\\" refer to academic disciplines or fields of knowledge that do not necessarily require union membership for career advancement.

Step 1: Determine the difference in interest rates. Initial rate: 8% New rate: 7 3/4% = 7.75 % Difference in rates: 8% - 7.75% = 0.25% Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the difference in interest rates and the yearly income. Let the capital (principal amount invested) be P. Yearly income diminishes by Rs. 65.50 when the interest rate falls by 0.25%, so: 0.25% of P = 65.50 (0.25/100) * P = 65.50 Step 3: Solve for the capital (P). P = 65.50 / (0.25/100) P = 65.50 * (100 / 0.25) P = 65.50 * 400 P = 26,200 The capital (principal amount invested) is Rs. 26,200.

Some are only big enough to fit one or two people, while others are massive enough to include tables and chairs. If you're buying a tent for personal use, you should stick to smaller-sized tents. Bigger tents are harder to carry around, and usually take longer to put together and dismantle. Tents will usually have a recommended persons limit on the box. Although the worth of these estimates is a bit iffy (you should usually round up the number, if anything) it can give you some insight as to the approximate size.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A scientist turns out to be able to see the future by offering each of some four-year-olds a piece of candy and watching how he or she deals with it. Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment. By the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible . Actually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test. The hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul. Here comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \\"character\\". EQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use. Among the ingredients for success, researchers now generally agree that IQ counts for about 20%; the rest depends on everything from social class to luck.

Logan has been a scout through the National Parks Council in Utah, where local leaders have made accommodations for him, allowing him to progress and earn badges by doing the best he could. For his Eagle Scout project, Logan had planned to create kits for babies with special needs. While local officials approved the plan, the national organization reversed the decision and, in addition, voided all the merit badges Logan had earned up until that point. As a result, the Blythe family sued the BSA and the Utah National Parks Council for \\"outrageous and reckless conduct.\\" Although the Blythe family has argued that the decision to block Logan from earning his Eagle Scout rank and rescinding his badges is discriminatory, a spokesperson for the organization disagrees, stating that the group has offered the Blythes ‚Äúa path to earning alternative merit badges based on [Logan‚Äôs] abilities.\\" According to the spokesperson, all scouts are expected to earn badges by performing the same or similar tasks, a principle they believe promotes equity. This policy of standardization has come under scrutiny, as it may put individuals with disabilities or special needs at a disadvantage when it comes to achieving specific scout accolades. The BSA has indeed shown willingness to adapt and accept change in the past, such as the recent decision to also allow girls to join the organization. However, this lawsuit spotlights a potential gap in their inclusivity policies, especially in regards to individuals with disabilities. It is important to take into consideration both the need to ensure equal opportunities for everyone, including those with special needs, as well as upholding the integrity of the merit badge system. The balance between these two objectives is crucial for the BSA to provide a fair and positive experience for all scouts, regardless of their physical or mental abilities. In light of the lawsuit, the BSA, as well as other organizations with standardized achievement systems, might consider evaluating their policies and ensuring that they cater to different abilities, ensuring no scout or participant is left out on the basis of abilities or disabilities. Providing alternative paths to achieving merit badges, taking into consideration the individual's specific needs and capabilities, could be one way to ensure a more inclusive and equity-driven system for all scouts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are known as the \\"Flawless Four\\" who are the most popular girls in Reagan High School in southern California.

Julie was \\"doomed to be popular because of 'that face' and because she was best friends with Elizabeth Purr\\". Cold-blooded queen bee Courtney and her airheaded friend, Marcie, demand respect through terror.However, Courtney, Marcie and Julie play a mindless prank on Liz the morning of her seventeenth birthday, by performing a fake kidnapping: They surprise Liz in bed, bind her with ropes (with Courtney ramming a jawbreaker candyball into her mouth to gag her) and cover it with duct tape.

However, upon opening the trunk, they are greeted with the grisly sight of Liz dead, having choked to death by aspirating the jawbreaker into her larynx.Horrified, Julie wants to go to the police but Courtney forbids her. Instead, Courtney calls the school pretending to be Liz's mother and tells them Liz is ill and cannot attend school. To keep up appearances, Courtney, Marcie and Julie then go to school as though nothing had happened.

The single biggest strategic mistake Republicans made with the shutdown By virtually any measure, the rollout of the health-care exchanges ‚Äî a central element of the Affordable Care Act ‚Äî has been a disaster. Technical glitches abound and a new poll conducted by the Associated Press-GfK shows that just 27 percent of Americans believe the unveiling of the exchanges has gone well. A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration. REUTERS/Mike Segar That‚Äôs front page/top of broadcast sort of news. And it‚Äôs all bad for President Obama. Except that the federal government is shut down, a story so big that it has sucked up all the media oxygen that under virtually any other circumstances would be spent on the problems with a centerpiece of Obamacare. And that is Republicans‚Äô single biggest strategic misstep of this entire shutdown ‚Äî and the one that may haunt them for months to come. As we have written before, health care is a stone-cold winner ‚Äî if polling is accurate ‚Äî for Republicans in the midterm elections unless they screw it up, which they are in the process of doing. First, Republicans ‚Äî led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ‚Äî chose, literally, the one message on Obamacare that isn‚Äôt popular among the public: linking the defunding of the law to funding the federal government. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted late last month, just one in four (27 percent) respondents said they approved of tying the defunding of Obamacare to keeping the government open. That same poll showed a majority (52 percent) of Americans disapproving of the law. And now, by making good on the threat to shut down the government unless Obama and Senate Democrats agreed to revise the health-care law, Republicans have effectively obscured for the American public a grand-slam sort of issue for them. Imagine for a moment that after fighting like hell to repeal/defund/delay Obamacare, congressional Republicans cut a deal to keep the government open on Sept. 30. The next day, the health-insurance exchanges debuted ‚Äî to initial (and continuing) bad reviews. Not only would there be wall-to-wall media coverage of the problems but Republicans would be perfectly positioned to say, ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù. The struggles of the exchanges to get off the ground would be Exhibit A to reinforce the Republican argument that the program is simply not ready for prime time and needs to be delayed and/or reexamined. Instead, the problems with the rollout of the health-insurance exchanges are on the back burner. What‚Äôs on the front one? The divide within the Republican Party over the best way forward on the shutdown and the broad fiscal debate. Since it‚Äôs baseball playoff season, we‚Äôll put it in those terms: Republicans took a hanging curveball and not only didn‚Äôt swing at it but closed their eyes when it was thrown. And they will almost certainly look back with regret on that decision. Chris Cillizza is founder and editor of The Fix, a leading blog on state and national politics.

Craig didn't like having Jeffrey as a roommate, because Options are: (1). Craig never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom.. (2). Jeffrey never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom..","completion":"Craig didn't like having Jeffrey as a roommate, because Jeffrey never replaced the toilet paper in the bathroom. This seemingly insignificant oversight quickly turned into a major annoyance for Craig, causing discord between the two young roommates. Whenever Craig went to use the bathroom, he dreaded encountering the inevitable cardboard roll devoid of even a single square of tissue. This unfortunate reality occurred far too frequently in their shared living situation and began to consume an unhealthy amount of Craig's thoughts. It wasn't just the act of replacing the toilet paper that bothered Craig, but also the principle behind it. He firmly believed in the importance of cleanliness, courtesy, and respect in a shared living space. The fact that Jeffrey seemed to lack these basic qualities troubled Craig deeply. After all, roommates were supposed to make life easier, not more complicated. Yet, every time Craig found himself staring at that empty toilet paper roll, he couldn't help but feel that his roommate was making life just a little bit harder. As the situation continued, Craig only grew more frustrated. He tried subtly hinting to Jeffrey about the importance of keeping the bathroom well-stocked, making seemingly casual comments like, \\"Hey, looks like we're running low on toilet paper again.\\" However, Jeffrey either didn't pick up on these cues or simply chose to ignore them in favor of continuing his inconsiderate habits. It wasn't long before Craig decided it was necessary to bring up the issue more directly. He confronted Jeffrey about his habit of not replacing the toilet paper, explaining how it was causing friction in their relationship as roommates. Surprisingly, Jeffrey was just as disappointed to learn about Craig's irritation. According to Jeffrey, he simply kept forgetting to replace the toilet paper due to his busy schedule and often absent-minded nature. Although Craig doubted the sincerity of this excuse, he hesitantly accepted Jeffrey's apology and agreed to give him another chance. It was true that Jeffrey's life was rather chaotic - he was constantly juggling school, work, and a social life. There was a small possibility that Jeffrey's negligence might not have been entirely malicious. But Craig made one thing clear: if things didn't change, their roommate arrangement would have to be reconsidered. A few short days later, Craig held his breath as he reached for the bathroom door handle in the morning. While he hoped he had gotten through to Jeffrey during their conversation, he had also learned to maintain low expectations. As he entered the bathroom and looked towards the toilet paper holder, he was pleasantly surprised to find a brand new roll of toilet paper neatly placed on the dispenser. It appeared that Jeffrey was finally making an effort to change his negligent ways. Over time, Jeffrey showed consistency in replacing the toilet paper as needed. Although it may have seemed like a small victory for Craig, it truly represented something much larger - a triumph of communication and understanding. While the ordeal with the toilet paper may have been the major source of tension between Craig and Jeffrey, it also provided an opportunity for them to grow and learn from each other. In the end, their friendship became stronger, and they continued living together harmoniously. As time went on, Craig and Jeffrey became more than just roommates. They started to share interests and built a meaningful friendship based on mutual respect and consideration for each other‚Äôs needs. Eventually, they began to view each other as brothers, laughing when they recalled their rocky start over something as seemingly trivial as replacing toilet paper. The experience taught both of them that life is about compromise, adaptation, and being conscious of the feelings of those around them. It opened doors for important conversations about responsibility and empathy, ultimately transforming two people from mere co-inhabitants into steadfast friends who had each other's backs in an unpredictable world. Sometimes the smallest issues can reveal significant life lessons, and in Craig and Jeffrey's case, the story was no different."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who was the Emperor of Germany the first time that the Mongols invaded Eastern Europe after shattering the Kievan Rus' principalities?\\" Context: \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084‚Äì1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111‚Äì25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155‚Äì90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220‚Äì1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

George's father Sir Robert (Paul Freeman), a previous friend of King Edgaar's and an amputee following his own battle with the mother dragon, gives his son George a \\"dragon horn\\", which \\"sounds a note only a dragon can hear\\". When George encounters the princess, he attempts to destroy the egg, but she knocks him unconscious each time he tries. In company with their companions, they transport the egg by wagon back to her father. Along the way they stop at a convent; Lunna's cousin is a nun there, and one of the friars is an old friend of George.

The output should be a list of numbers that is the result of applying that logic to the input list. You should not round any decimals in the output. Zero should be counted as an even integer. Problem:[-90, 82, 62] Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the elements in the list and determine if each element is even or odd. The given list is: [-90, 82, 62] For element -90: Since -90 is divisible by 2, it is an even integer. For element 82: Since 82 is divisible by 2, it is an even integer. For element 62: Since 62 is divisible by 2, it is an even integer. Step 2: Apply the logic to each element based on its even or odd nature. For even elements: Divide by 4 For odd elements: Multiply by 4, then add 2 Step 3: Apply the logic to each element in the list. For element -90 (even): Divide by 4 => -90 / 4 = -22.5 For element 82 (even): Divide by 4 => 82 / 4 = 20.5 For element 62 (even): Divide by 4 => 62 / 4 = 15.5 Step 4: Create the output list with the resulting numbers.

Article:The East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust uncovered a series of failures and has apologised to Kim Page for the death of her husband Gary. It described the leader of the crew as \\"complacent\\" for not heeding the concerns of a more junior colleague. A coroner last month found \\"serious failings\\" in Mr Page's care. The episode has shone a spotlight on the greater use of private ambulances in attending emergency calls. Mrs Page is taking civil action against East of England Ambulance Service and Private Ambulance Service Ltd for damages. Kim and Gary Page - who was 54 - were relaxing at home in Laindon in Essex in February this year when Gary felt pains in his chest and right arm. Mrs Page looked up the symptoms on the internet and dialled 111 to seek advice. She said: \\"Gary was on his hands and knees on the sofa speaking to 111. He was able to talk but he was obviously in discomfort.\\" East of England Ambulance trust dispatched a team at the second highest level. Because they were busy, they sent a private ambulance team - a regular occurrence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The team from Private Ambulance Service Limited didn't have a paramedic on board. The most senior member of the crew was an emergency technician called Lauren de la Haye. She received her qualification certificate a few days before, although she had practised as an emergency medic under supervision for several years. Mrs Page remembers Ms de la Haye saying: \\"It is definitely not your heart, you are definitely not having a heart attack. \\"I wish all my patients were like you sitting here talking to me.\\" The team carried out two heart traces, one with four leads, the other with 12. The results showed that Gary's heart beat was abnormal. \\"Abnormal ECG\\" was written across the top of one of the traces. Ms de la Haye did not agree - even when another team member said he was worried. Mrs Page said: \\"When Gary asked, 'What do you think it could be?' Lauren de la Haye asked him what he did for a living. \\"He explained he went into lofts as part of his job and she thought he could have pulled a muscle, or that he might have indigestion. \\"Then she said, 'We can take you to the hospital but you will have a 10-hour wait.' \\"She said that three times, as if it were unnecessary for him to go.\\" Still in pain, and without his reading glasses, Mr Page signed a document that Ms de la Haye presented saying that he agreed not to go to hospital. The crew left. Mrs Page says the medics did not advise them what to do if the symptoms continued. She went to a nearby pharmacy to fetch indigestion medicine and painkillers while Gary took a shower. The couple were relieved but Gary's symptoms did not ease. They eventually went to bed and Kim fell asleep. Gary, who was 6ft 4in, moved into the spare room to get more comfortable. Just before dawn, Kim woke to hear unusually heavy snoring and snorting from the spare room. She tried to wake Gary, first gently then more forcefully. Panicking, she called 999, and this time an NHS ambulance came. It was too late. Gary took his last breath as Kim tried to revive him. He died 10 hours after his symptoms started, and was just minutes away from a specialist heart unit at Basildon University Hospital. An inquest heard the root cause of Gary Page's death was Lauren de la Haye's failure to identify an evolving heart attack, and her not contacting the clinical advice line for further support, even when prompted to do so by a more junior colleague. Ms de la Haye did not attend the inquest as she was ill. She told the BBC that an ECG could be difficult to interpret for a technician, and that Mr Page was advised to seek further help, which he did not do. She said Gary and Kim Page fully understood what they were agreeing to when signing the transport waiver. She is now a student on another medical course. The inquest also heard that the lack of a paramedic was a problem - but was not against the East of England's Ambulance Service Trust's rules. The Trust offered a formal apology to Mr Page's family and said: \\"The seriousness of Mr Page's condition was not recognised and further advice not sought.\\" In response to Mr Page's death, the rules for private ambulance crew in the East of England Trust area have been clarified. Any medic below the level of paramedic must either take a patient to a hospital, or phone the clinical advice line at East of England Ambulance Service to explain why the patient can be discharged. Spending on private ambulances to answer 999 calls in England has trebled in the past four years. In 2011-12 ambulances trusts spent about √Ç¬£22m. By this year, the figure was closer to √Ç¬£69m. The private sector offers higher pay to their staff and ambulance trusts find it harder to compete for qualified staff as there is a shortage of paramedics. The number of calls for an ambulance has also more than doubled in the last decade to more than nine million a year. Mrs Page's solicitor, Stephanie Prior, believes the general public is largely unaware of the extent to which private ambulance crews are used in emergency situations. She said: \\"They wear the same green uniforms as NHS ambulance crews and patients put their trust in them. \\"But unlike with a doctor, nurse or paramedic, emergency assistants or technicians are not on any professional register. \\"No-one but their direct employer knows how qualified they are or how experienced. \\"There is no way to record it if they make a mistake or should be struck off.\\" But the Independent Ambulance Association believes the public shouldn't be alarmed. Alan Howson, from the association, said: \\"We were very sorry to learn of this incident and our thoughts are with the victim's family and loved ones. \\"Many personnel in the independent sector are both current and former NHS staff and highly qualified. \\"Ideally technicians should be under the supervision of paramedics. \\"If they were registered separately then it would mean they are more accountable and could be 'struck off' if they were shown to have malpractised.\\" It is little comfort to Kim Page. \\"I've lost the love of my life,\\" she said. \\"He should be here with me now, because this was all unnecessary and now I've got to find a way of living without him, and I don't want to.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust has uncovered a series of failures and has apologized to Kim Page for the death of her husband, Gary Page.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: From age eight to eleven, I studied at a small school in Bath, England. It was a small school of four classes, with about twenty-five children in each class according to age. For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day.

An invisible shield, some 7,200 miles (11,600 km) above Earth, has been found blocking 'killer electrons' from bombarding our planet. These electrons can whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and damage space systems. If they hit Earth on a large scale, they could knock out power grids, radically change the planet's climate and drive up rates of cancer. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons. But while scientists know this mysterious shield exists, they are baffled as to how it formed and how exactly it works. 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker from the University of Colorado Boulder. The shield was discovered in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth that are filled with high-energy electrons and protons. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. They were discovered in 1958 and are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. Held in place by Earth's magnetic field, the Van Allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. 'Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on Star Trek (pictured) that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons,' said Professor Daniel Baker. The Van Allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around Earth. They are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. The belts are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles (40,000km) above Earth's surface. The radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are. The belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the first U.S space mission. One theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside. The second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within. Nasa sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds. Last year, Professor Baker led a team that used the twin Van Allen Probes launched in 2012 to discover a third, transient 'storage ring'. This ring is located between the inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts and seems to come and go with the intensity of space weather. This ring appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breaching the shield and moving deeper towards Earth's atmosphere. 'It's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space,' said Professor Baker. 'It's an extremely puzzling phenomenon.' The team originally thought the highly charged electrons, which are looping around Earth at more than 100,000 miles per second, would slowly drift downward into the upper atmosphere. But the impenetrable barrier seen by the twin Van Allen belt spacecraft stops the electrons before they get that far, said Professor Baker. The group looked at a number of scenarios that could create and maintain such a barrier. The team wondered if it might have to do with Earth's magnetic field lines. These lines trap and control protons and electrons, bouncing them between Earth's poles like beads on a string. They also looked at whether radio signals from human transmitters on Earth could be scattering the charged electrons at the barrier, preventing their downward motion. Killer electrons whip around the planet at near-light speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms. But neither explanation held scientific weight, Professor Baker said. 'Nature abhors strong gradients and generally finds ways to smooth them out, so we would expect some of the relativistic electrons to move inward and some outward,' he added. 'It's not obvious how the slow, gradual processes that should be involved in motion of these particles can conspire to create such a sharp, persistent boundary at this location in space.' Another scenario is that the giant cloud of cold, electrically charged gas called the plasmasphere, which begins about 600 miles (960km) above, is scattering the electrons at the boundary. In March, scientists looking at charged particles in space discovered particle hurricanes surrounding Earth. These highly-charged particles are part of the Van Allen belts. Since the belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belt. Data from Nasa's twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on Earth. This theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions. Space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high-energy radiation belts that circle Saturn and Jupiter, as well as around sun-like stars. It could be doing this with low frequency, electromagnetic waves that create a plasmapheric 'hiss'. The hiss sounds like white noise when played over a speaker, Professor Baker said. While the plasmaspheric hiss may play a role in the puzzling space barrier, Professor Baker believes there is more to the story. 'I think the key here is to keep observing the region in exquisite detail, which we can do because of the powerful instruments on the Van Allen probes,' he said. 'If the sun really blasts the Earth's magnetosphere with a coronal mass ejection (CME), I suspect it will breach the shield for a period of time.'

The shield is located in the Van Allen radiation belts - two doughnut-shaped rings above Earth filled with high-energy particles, held in place by Earth's magnetic field. 3. Scientists are not yet certain about the formation and exact functioning of the shield. However, it has been compared to force fields in the Star Trek series which repel alien weapons. 4. One theory about the shield's operation is that the plasmasphere, a large cloud of cold, electrically charged gas, could be scattering electrons at the boundary. 5. Researchers led by Professor Daniel Baker have discovered a third, transient 'storage ring' between the inner and outer Van Allen radiation belts that appears to block ultrafast electrons from getting closer to Earth's atmosphere. 6. The team is continuing to study the region in detail using the powerful instruments on the Van Allen probes to further understand the phenomenon and observe its reaction to potential breaches from solar events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: And he circled back time and again to a favorite meal served at Steak ‚Äôn Shake, an old-fashioned hamburger chain beloved in his part of the Midwest. When he wrote about it last year on his blog, Roger Ebert‚Äôs Journal, people saw that the legendary movie critic for The Chicago Sun-Times could also knock out some great food writing. ‚ÄúA downstate Illinois boy loves the Steak ‚Äôn Shake as a Puerto Rican loves rice and beans, an Egyptian loves falafel, a Brit loves banger and mash, an Indian loves tikki ki chaat, a Swede loves herring, a Finn loves reindeer jerky, and a Canadian loves bran muffins,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúThese matters do not involve taste. They involve a deep-seated conviction that a food is absolutely right, and always has been, and always will be.‚Äù He both writes and thinks about food in the present tense. Ask about favorite foods and he‚Äôll scribble a note: ‚ÄúI love spicy and Indian.‚Äù An offer to bring some New Jersey peaches to his summer home here on the shore of Lake Michigan brings a sharp defense of Michigan peaches and a menu idea. ‚ÄúMaybe for dessert we could have a salad of local fresh fruits.‚Äù ‚ÄúFood for me is in the present tense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEating for me is now only in the past tense.‚Äù He says he has a ‚Äúvoluptuous food memory‚Äù that gets stronger all the time. ‚ÄúI can remember the taste and smell of everything, even though I can no longer taste or smell,‚Äù he said. That is, he concedes later, a bit sweeping. He can‚Äôt remember the food at a French spa prepared by Michel Gu√©rard, who has three Michelin stars. And he can‚Äôt recall the last meal he ever ate, because who knew then that surgeons would never be able to fix it all? But he remembers everything about the food at the Steak ‚Äôn Shake. In the hospital, he told me, he ate Steak ‚Äôn Shake meals a bite at a time in his mind. Still, what he longs for most is the talk and fellowship of the table. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ‚ÄúThe jokes, gossip, laughs, arguments and shared memories I miss,‚Äù he wrote in a blog post. The eating itself is a side note, really. Anyone who has put together a winning dinner party understands that. But food ‚Äî the cooking and sharing part of it ‚Äî still means so much to him that he is publishing a cookbook this month. It‚Äôs based entirely on meals to be made in a rice cooker. The title is ‚ÄúThe Pot and How to Use It: The Mystery and Romance of the Rice Cooker‚Äù (Andrews McMeel Publishing, 14.99). How can a guy without a working tongue write a recipe? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all experience, my visuals and friendly tasters,‚Äù he wrote to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve used The Pot so very many times I know what everything I make in it MUST taste like.‚Äù Photo The first rice cooker in the Ebert household was a wedding gift from the couple‚Äôs longtime friend and personal assistant, Carol Iwata. It wasn‚Äôt until Mr. Ebert became serious about losing weight and went to the Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa in Florida that he began to tinker with cooking grains other than rice. He went nerdy and deep. ‚ÄúWhenever Roger learns anything, he becomes obsessed with it,‚Äù Mrs. Ebert said. Soon, entire meals were coming out of the rice cooker. He made fruit and oatmeal breakfasts and stews for supper, figuring out how to mess with the settings and stage the ingredients so that everything didn‚Äôt turn to mush. He took his little three-cupper to Sundance so he could march through a marathon of movies with something more than popcorn and candy in his stomach. In 2008, long after he accepted that he would never put food in his mouth again, he wrote a blog post presenting his philosophy of The Pot as a way for all the people with not much space and not much time or money to cook for themselves. ‚ÄúI am thinking of you, student in your dorm room,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúYou, shut-in. You, recovering campaign worker. You, movie critic at Sundance. You, sex worker waiting for the phone to ring. You, factory worker sick of frozen meals. You, people in Werner Herzog‚Äôs documentary about life at the South Pole.‚Äù The post became the frame for the book. ‚ÄúI am a quick, direct, practical and simple cook, which is why the rice cooker had such an appeal to me,‚Äù he explained. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ‚ÄúThe Pot‚Äù follows food obsessions that include a long affair with a wok and with a Madhur Jaffrey dish that involves sealing a chicken in a pot with flour paste. Although Mr. Ebert often doesn‚Äôt follow cookbooks, his 150-volume collection includes well-used copies of ‚ÄúCraig Claiborne‚Äôs Kitchen Primer,‚Äù which taught him to cook, and a later edition of ‚ÄúCooking in Ten Minutes,‚Äù published in 1948 by √âdouard de Pomiane. Most of the recipes came from Mr. Ebert‚Äôs head, from friends and from a dedicated group of blog readers who started a sub-cult built around him and rice cookers. They form just one of many tribes who have recently discovered him as a prolific, post-cancer online personality.

He spends hours propped in his reclining chairs at the couple‚Äôs homes in Chicago and here in Michigan, tending his blog and his Twitter account, which has nearly a quarter-million followers. ‚ÄúThe blog has opened a new world just when I needed it,‚Äù he told me. Dorothy O‚ÄôBrien, who edited the book, sent the recipes to professional testers to get the unruly collection into shape. There wasn‚Äôt much to do to the copy, though. It was nearly perfect. The book, she said, is ‚Äúmore about his philosophy of food and eating and why we eat.‚Äù It also includes comments from his digital followers, which makes it something of a community cookbook. ‚ÄúWhen he says he misses the camaraderie of eating, that‚Äôs what he misses more than the food,‚Äù she said. Mr. Ebert wisely recruited Anna Thomas, the author of the classic ‚ÄúThe Vegetarian Epicure‚Äù and the book ‚ÄúLove Soup,‚Äù as his culinary ombudswoman. She decries the limits of The Pot‚Äôs two settings ‚Äî ‚Äúinsanely high and barely warm‚Äù ‚Äî and argued against the inclusion of canned soup and powdered broth in many of the book‚Äôs recipes. (She lost.) But she salutes the spirit of one-pot cooking and contributed recipes with smart ways to coax flavors from The Pot with browned onion and fresh ingredients, like ripe tomatoes in a summer soup with farro. Photo Health is a sub-theme. Mr. Ebert remains obsessed with grains and sodium levels, lessons he learned when his wife persuaded him to go to the Pritikin Center to lose weight. He dropped about 70 pounds just before he got sick, and another 40 or so during his illness. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The book is funny, too. His list of meats to throw into The Pot includes chicken, pork, goat and Minotaur. In explaining how The Pot knows when the rice is done, he writes: ‚ÄúIt is an ancient mystery of the Orient. Don‚Äôt ask questions you don‚Äôt need the answers to.‚Äù Cooking with Mr. Ebert, who can‚Äôt speak but has a very deliberate way in the kitchen, is both a thrill and a challenge. His physical condition limits the time he can spend there, but he makes good use of it, keeping things simple and relying on the Cuisinart to chop ingredients, even for a salad. Mrs. Ebert, a lawyer who grew up in a big family and is more used to cooking for a crowd, designed the huge kitchen in the lake house, which her husband has owned since the 1980s. It has generous counters and an oversize table that seats a dozen. They have hosted Fourth of July parties with 300 people and Thanksgiving for 30. Since his operations, the cooking has been on a much smaller scale. The dish we prepared one day last month didn‚Äôt have a name and wasn‚Äôt written down anywhere. Because I had no idea where we were going as we cooked, it rendered the session something like a ‚ÄúTop Chef‚Äù challenge. He started by dumping water into The Pot with a store-bought blend of rice, grain and lentils called SooFoo. Then he sent me to chop some Michigan peaches. ‚ÄúBetter use ripe peach,‚Äù he scribbled when I was slicing one that seemed a bit hard. ‚ÄúI handed to you.‚Äù I had to guess what he meant when he waved off the bowl I selected to hold the yellow peppers I had chopped. Was it the bowl or was the chopping wrong? At one point, I think he got very frustrated. He wanted to make a nice lunch, but I kept interrupting him with questions. A photographer kept taking pictures. Mrs. Ebert, who has a rare patience, was getting tired. He scribbled a few hurried instructions for me and left the kitchen. He hadn‚Äôt taken any nourishment in a while, and his shoulder, whose muscle had been used in an effort to repair his face, had started to ache. Advertisement Continue reading the main story He eased into the big black recliner in his study, and his wife got out a can of the Isosource that keeps him alive. He takes about six cans four times a day, mixed with water. Sometimes he gets fresh fruit or vegetable juice or a little shot of Pepsi, which helps clean the tube. While he‚Äôs in the chair, I tend to the onions and garlic in one pot and keep stirring the grains, peaches and pork in another. I mix them together, as he instructed. I peek into the study and watch him take his liquid meal, embarrassed by my curiosity. After about 15 minutes he walks out and scribbles me a note. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you made certain the pork was heated through.‚Äù Yes, chef, I say. He scribbles again. It‚Äôs an apology. ‚ÄúI come across as a tyrannical chef because I never speak and am in a hurry because of my shoulder.‚Äù No worries, chef, I say. Then I lift the lid from The Pot. He pours a little spicy Saigon Sizzle sauce from a bottle and stirs it in. Then he gives me a thumbs up. It‚Äôs time to eat. ||||| Typically, I write over 200 reviews a year for the Sun-Times that are carried by Universal Press Syndicate in some 200 newspapers. Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles. I must slow down now, which is why I'm taking what I like to call \\"a leave of presence.\\"What in the world is a leave of presence? It means I am not going away. My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me. What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.At the same time, I am re-launching the new and improved Rogerebert.com and taking ownership of the site under a separate entity,, run by me, my beloved wife, Chaz, and our brilliant friend, Josh Golden of. Stepping away from the day-to-day grind will enable me to continue as a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, and roll out other projects under the Ebert brand in the coming year.Ebertfest, my annual film festival, celebrating its 15th year, will continue at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, my alma mater and home town, April 17-21. In response to your repeated requests to bring back the TV show \\"At the Movies,\\" I am launching a fundraising campaign via Kickstarter in the next couple of weeks. And gamers beware, I am even thinking about a movie version of a video game or mobile app. Once completed, you can engage me in debate on whether you think it is art.And I continue to cooperate with the talented filmmaker Steve James on the bio-documentary he, Steve Zaillian and Martin Scorsese are making about my life. I am humbled that anyone would even think to do it, but I am also grateful.Of course, there will be some changes. The immediate reason for my \\"leave of presence\\" is my health. The \\"painful fracture\\" that made it difficult for me to walk has recently been revealed to be a cancer. It is being treated with radiation, which has made it impossible for me to attend as many movies as I used to. I have been watching more of them on screener copies that the studios have been kind enough to send to me. My friend and colleague Richard Roeper and other critics have stepped up and kept the newspaper and website current with reviews of all the major releases. So we have and will continue to go on.At this point in my life, in addition to writing about movies, I may write about what it's like to cope with health challenges and the limitations they can force upon you. It really stinks that the cancer has returned and that I have spent too many days in the hospital. So on bad days I may write about the vulnerability that accompanies illness. On good days, I may wax ecstatic about a movie so good it transports me beyond illness.I'll also be able to review classics for my \\"Great Movies\\" collection, which has produced three books and could justify a fourth.For now, I am throwing myself into Ebert Digital and the redesigned, highly interactive and searchable Rogerebert.com. You'll learn more about its exciting new features on April 9 when the site is launched. In addition to housing an archive of more than 10,000 of my reviews dating back to 1967 we will also feature reviews written by other critics. You may disagree with them like you have with me, but will nonetheless appreciate what they bring to the party. Some I recruited from the ranks of my Far Flung Correspondents, an inspiration I had four years ago when I noticed how many of the comments on my blog came from foreign lands and how knowledgeable they were about cinema.We'll be recruiting more critics and it is my hope that some of the writers I have admired over the years will be among them. We'll offer many more reviews of Indie, foreign, documentary and restored classic revivals. As the space between broadcast television, cable and the internet morph into a hybrid of content, we will continue to spotlight the musings of Pulitzer Prize-winning TV critic Tom Shales, as well as the blog \\"Scanners\\" by Jim Emerson, who I first met at Microsoft when he edited Cinemania. The Ebert Club newsletter, under editor Marie Haws of Vancouver, will be expanded to give its thousands of subscribers even bigger and better benefits.For years I devoutly took every one of my tear sheets, folded them and added them to a pile on my desk. The photo above shows the height of that pile in 1985 as it appeared on the cover of my first book about the movies published by my old friends John McMeel and Donna Martin of Andrews & McMeel. Today, because of technology, the opportunities to become bigger, better and reach more people are piling up too. The fact that we're re-launching the site now, in the midst of other challenges, should give you an idea how important Rogerebert.com and Ebert Digital are to Chaz and me. I hope you'll stop by, and look for me. I'll be there.So on this day of reflection I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll see you at the movies. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Legendary movie critic Roger Ebert reminisces about his love for food and the Steak ‚Äôn Shake, even though he is no longer able to eat.

Stunning visuals, gripping storyline, significant character development, and above all, some genuine thrill. Unfortunately, James Gray's Ad Astra not only fails to meet those expectations but also descends into an abysmal narrative abyss, rendering it a painful viewing experience. Boasting a cast led by Brad Pitt in the role of astronaut Roy McBride, Ad Astra offers a certain promise before unravelling its cloth of disappointment. Pitt delivers a tediously monotonous performance. He certainly tried resurrecting the frozen script with a few sprinkling of emotion, but even the charm of his scintillating blue eyes seemed lost in the zero-gravity vacuum of Space. The film revolves around the trite and worn-out idea of a son embarking on a journey to save humanity and find his long-lost father. To make it even more predictable, the writers sprinkled in a narrative structure revolving around self-discovery and redemption. The script, supposedly elite by Hollywood standards, is quite pedestrian, drowns in its ambition, and leaves the viewer sorely disappointed. The film also seems to suffer from an existential crisis, unable to decide whether it is a dense philosophical discourse or a frenzied space adventure. The lifeless dialogue and sleep-inducing soliloquies made it hard to connect with any character on an emotional level. It was like watching the endless expanse of space ‚Äì cold and unfeeling. Even the usually reliable Tommy Lee Jones, who played Clifford McBride, Roy's lost father, seems underwhelming. Despite his extended screen-time, his character is neither fully developed nor compelling. Instead, his character‚Äôs motivations felt forced and hard to comprehend. The narrative consistently hammers in the theme of isolation, which unfortunately expands to the audience's connection with the film. The cinematography is remarkable, with some truly awe-inspiring visuals, but it feels squandered when paralleled with such a lackluster narrative. It‚Äôs like standing in front of an exceptionally painted yet utterly meaningless canvas. Ruth Negga's short role is one of the very few highlights of the film. She shines and delivers an emotionally charged performance in her limited screen time. However, one actor‚Äôs shining moments cannot carry an entire movie, and Negga's talents were wasted in an underwritten role and an underwhelming narrative. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the film did have a handful of thrilling moments. The lunar rover chase sequence was undeniably gripping, and the scenes involving the space creatures were genuinely terrifying. However, these instances were dipped in the chaos of the overstuffed plot and overburdened narrative, truly delineating the saying ‚Äì too many cooks spoil the broth. In conclusion, Ad Astra seems more like an ostentatious Hollywood drama in the disguise of a sci-fi movie. It attempts to dive into profound philosophical ruminations but leaves the viewer cold and unaffected, lost and stranded in its emotional void. The imbalance between its breathtaking visuals and a stunted narrative echo an unfortunate disproportion that is impossible to ignore. Ad Astra, striving to reach the stars, falls dishearteningly short, leaving this viewer, at least, utterly unimpressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 584*y = -36*y - 768*y - 100794 + 17514 for y.","completion":"To solve the equation, I'll follow these steps: 1. Combine the terms with the variable y, 2. Simplify the equation, 3. Isolate y, 4. Solve for y. Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable y. The equation is 584*y = -36*y - 768*y - 100794 + 17514. The terms with the variable y on the right side are: -36*y and -768*y. To find the total value of these terms, -36*y - 768*y = (-36 - 768)*y = -804*y. Now the equation is: 584*y = -804*y - 100794 + 17514. Step 2: Simplify the equation. Rearrange the equation by moving the terms with the variable y on the left side and the constants on the right side by adding 804*y to both sides of the equation. 584*y + 804*y = -100794 + 17514. Combine the terms with the variable y: (584 + 804)*y = 1388*y. Now the equation is: 1388*y = -100794 + 17514. Step 3: Isolate y. Subtract 17514 from -100794: -100794 + 17514 = -83300. Now the equation is: 1388*y = -83300. Step 4: Solve for y. Divide both sides of the equation by 1388 to find the value of y: y = -83300 / 1388. y = -83300 / 1388 ‚âà -60.

Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations? The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, group L of larvae had more somatic mutations compared to group D. This is because group L displayed all kinds of mutations, while group D did not. Since somatic mutations are a type of mutation that occurs in the body cells, it is clear that group L would have exhibited more somatic mutations than group D."},{"prompt":"Information: - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\" - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633 26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy. - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence. - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource). - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power. - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility). - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna. - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games). - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism. - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit.

After high school, he wanted to join the U. S. Air Force but he failed because of his poor eyesight. However, his dream remained. At the age of 33, Ted was a truck driver in Los Angeles. One day, while sitting outside in his garden, he watched planes fly overhead and an idea came to him: to use balloons to fly. A few weeks later, Ted bought 42 huge balloons. He tied them to a chair and then he sat down in the chair with some beer, sandwiches and a gun. His plan was to fly to 10 meters above his garden, enjoy a few hours in the air, and then shoot some balloons with his gun to get back down. But things did not go as he planned. Once his friends cut the ropes under Ted's chair, the 42 balloons flew into the sky at an astonishing speed until about 4000 meters above the ground with Ted and his chair. He didn't shoot any of the balloons because he was afraid he might break the balanee of his \\"plane\\". Ted stayed in the sky with his beer and sandwiches for 14 hours, cold and frightened. Planes heading towards Los Angeles' busy international airport reported the strange sight. And Ted' s balloons caused great danger to them.

In 1648, in the wake of Charles I's arrest, and the growing threat to them from the armies of the English Parliament, the Confederates signed a treaty of alliance with the English Royalists. The joint Royalist and Confederate forces under Ormonde attempted to eliminate the Parliamentary army holding Dublin, but were routed at the battle of Rathmines by a Parliamentary army commanded by Colonel Michael Jones. As the former Member of Parliament Admiral Robert Blake blockaded Prince Rupert of the Rhine's fleet in Kinsale, Oliver Cromwell was able to land at Dublin on 15 August 1649 with the army to quell Royalist alliance in Ireland. The alliance, which was a compromise that gave command of the Irish Confederate forces to the English Royalists, was very shaky from the start, with many Confederates unhappy with the leadership of Ormonde. Indeed, the Confederates had fought a mini civil war among themselves in 1648 over this alliance, with Owen Roe O'Neill's Ulster army leaving the Confederation and only re-joining it after Cromwell had actually landed in Ireland. Partly as a result of this disunity, the Irish/Royalist coalition was driven from eastern Ireland by Cromwell, who beat down all resistance by his skill, and even more by his ruthless severity, in a brief campaign of nine months . At the end of May 1650 Cromwell turned over his command in Ireland to Henry Ireton and returned to England. It took two more years of prolonged siege and guerrilla warfare, before the last major Irish resistance was ended, after the fall of Galway in late 1652. The last Confederate Catholic troops surrendered in mid-1653. How many years between Cromwell landing in Dublin and Cromwell turning over his command?","completion":"Oliver Cromwell landed in Dublin on August 15, 1649, and he turned over his command to Henry Ireton at the end of May 1650.

And the answer is?","completion":"In Greek mythology, the mother of Oedipus was Queen Jocasta, also known as Iocaste or Epicaste. Jocasta was the wife of King Laius, who ruled over the ancient city-state of Thebes. Both Laius and Jocasta were descendants of the house of Cadmus, the legendary founder of Thebes. Jocasta was the daughter of Menoeceus, and was either the sister or cousin of Creon, depending on different mythological sources. The story of Jocasta, Oedipus, and King Laius is a tragic one, and central to the famous play \\"Oedipus Rex\\" (or \\"Oedipus the King\\") written by the ancient Greek playwright Sophocles. The tragedy begins when King Laius and Queen Jocasta receive a prophecy that their newborn son, Oedipus, will grow up to kill his father and marry his mother. Horrified, Laius orders a servant to take the infant Oedipus to the nearby Mount Cithaeron and abandon him there to die. However, the servant cannot bring himself to kill the baby and instead gives him to a shepherd from the city-state of Corinth who in turn presents the child to the childless King Polybus and Queen Merope, who then raise Oedipus as their own son. As Oedipus grows up, he learns about the prophecy from an oracle and, not knowing that he is adopted, believes that he might harm his adoptive parents. To avoid the tragic fate, he leaves Corinth and travels to Thebes. On the way, he unknowingly encounters his birth father, King Laius, and due to a dispute at a crossroads, Oedipus fulfills the first part of the prophecy by killing him. Upon reaching Thebes, Oedipus solves the riddle of the Sphinx, who has been tormenting the city, and as a reward he is made the new king and marries the widowed Queen Jocasta ‚Äì his own mother ‚Äì thus fulfilling the second part of the prophecy. Oedipus and Jocasta have four children together: two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, and two daughters, Antigone and Ismene.

Devastated upon discovering that she married her own son and realizing the depth of the prophecy's fulfillment, Jocasta takes her own life by hanging herself.

The Libyan dictator had a voracious sexual appetite and was so addicted to anti-impotence Viagra pills a nurse told him to cut down his intake. The sordid world of the despot who was killed last month in the country's uprising, has been revealed by his manservant of seven years. Voracious: Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi lived a life of extravagance and sexual addiction. Faisal, a young chef, cooked Andrew a 'traditional' dinner of tabouli, hummus and couscous when the prince met the Arab leader at the villa of one of his female friends. Later Andrew, who's office has confirmed he dined with Gadaffi in November 2008, told Faisal it was the finest meal he had ever had and posed for a picture with him. Trade ambassador: Prince Andrew had a meal with Gadaffi in 2008. The aide, now 29, said the royal trade ambassador discussed relations between Libya and Britain and an oil contract. What Andrew was unaware of was Gaddafi's penchant for young women - many of whom were his bodyguards, according to Faisal. He said: There were four or sometimes five women each day. They had just become a habit to Gadaffi. 'They would go into his bedroom, he would have his way with them and then he would come out like he had just blown his nose.' Faisal, on leave from prison for the Muslim holiday of Eid, became friends with the bodyguards who were known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution'. He told the Sunday Times: They all had sex with Gadaffi. The more canny of them became wealthy from his gifts of villas or large sums of cash.' Faisal claimed that some of the women he bedded suffered so badly 'they went immediately from his bedroom to the hospital' to be treated for internal injuries. His addiction to Viagra, said the aide, was so extensive that his Ukrainian nurse urged to him to reduce the number of pills he swallowed every day. Gadaffi picked up victims at his former alma mater, Tripoli University, where he gave lectures and then led the young women to a nearby room whose only furniture was a double bed. Faisal claimed that another aide was once sent to a sex district of Paris, to buy a machine that Gadaffi used to apparently lengthen his penis. The despot was vain about his looks and demanded the aide dye his hair, cover up his baldness and use make-up and treatments with green tea to hide his wrinkles. Faisal, who became a favourite of the dictator with his own house and car, sprayed a French-made lotion on the front of Gadaffi's head so his receding hairline would not be obvious. The aide was forced to be his servant after death threats were made against his family unless he obeyed. Faisal was captured by anti-Gadaffi forces but is unlike to be charged.

Gaddafi had a voracious sexual appetite and was heavily dependent on Viagra pills, to the extent that his nurse advised him to cut down his intake. The women he was involved with included many of his bodyguards, known as the 'Nuns of the Revolution,' who in some cases received expensive gifts from him. Gaddafi was also vain about his appearance, demanding his aide to dye his hair, cover his baldness, and use make-up and treatments to hide his wrinkles. Faisal became a servant to Gaddafi after receiving threats against his family, and their relationship resulted in Faisal having his own house and car. Faisal was captured by anti-Gaddafi forces but is unlikely to be charged."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He has a broken leg and is suffering from amnesia. He hallucinates about a woman (Caroline Dhavernas) finding him. He also drives away a cougar after giving two warning shots from a revolver he retrieved inside the car. After a few days of being stuck in that position, he manages to escape the car by prying out the car door with a shifter lever. In the car, he finds bags of money and hears on the car radio about an armed robbery by a man named Raymond Plazzy. Finding a credit card under the passenger seat in the name of Raymond Plazzy, The Man assumes that he is Raymond Plazzy and that he committed the robbery. A man (Adrian Holmes) wearing hunting gear emerges from the woods and starts to loot the wrecked car. The Man tries to get help from the hunter, who just runs away with some of the stolen money. A dog appears, and The Man follows it into the woods. He finds a working cell phone inside a cave, discovering the tragic fate of the hunter who was possibly attacked by the cougar. The Man cannot obtain a signal in the woods. Frequently hallucinating about the woman, he finally shoots her with the revolver after realizing the hallucination led him back to the car. He then decides to get out of the ravine. After crawling for days, he finds a road and a dead body with a driver's license that says Raymond Plazzy. He then pieces together what happened to him: He was running errands with his wife (the Woman) when he witnessed an armed robbery and was taken hostage by Plazzy. They were driving down the road, arguing about the situation; and he used the moment to grab the wheel, causing the car to crash.

Die in Neapel verbrachten Jahre ( bis 1340) hatten gro√üen Einfluss auf die pers√∂nliche und intellektuelle Entwicklung Boccaccios. Translate this to English?","completion":"The years spent in Naples (until 1340) had a great influence on Boccaccio's personal and intellectual development. Giovanni Boccaccio was an Italian writer, poet, and scholar who lived during the 14th century (1313-1375). He is well-known for his masterpiece, \\"The Decameron,\\" a collection of 100 short stories that remains an important literary work in Western history. Boccaccio's years in Naples (until 1340) had a significant impact on his personal and intellectual growth. It was during this time that Boccaccio became acquainted with the intellectual and artistic circles of Naples, which was a thriving center for culture, learning, and commerce. Naples was part of the Kingdom of Sicily and was governed by the Angevin dynasty, which had strong ties to the French culture. This exposure to different cultures enriched Boccaccio's knowledge and would later be reflected in his works. While in Naples, Boccaccio studied law and pursued literary studies under the guidance of some eminent teachers. He was deeply influenced by the writings of classical authors such as Dante Alighieri, Virgil, Ovid, and Petrarch. Boccaccio's passion for literature and his eagerness to learn also led him to explore different genres and texts, which contributed to the development of his unique narrative style. During his time in this vibrant city, Boccaccio also developed important connections with the Neapolitan nobility. He became acquainted with important figures of the time, such as King Robert of Anjou, Queen Giovanna I, and Niccol√≤ Acciaiuoli, a prominent nobleman. These connections would not only provide him with protection and patronage but would also serve as an inspiration for his literary works, as he often drew from his real-life experiences and encounters. Being in Naples also had a significant impact on Boccaccio's personal life. It is said that while in the city, he met his muse and the love of his life, Fiammetta, who is thought to have been a noblewoman named Maria d'Aquino, an illegitimate daughter of King Robert. Boccaccio's love for Fiammetta inspired several of his literary works, including \\"Filocopo,\\" \\"Ameto,\\" \\"La caccia di Diana,\\" and most notably, \\"The Decameron,\\" where she appears as a character. In conclusion, Boccaccio's years in Naples until 1340 were crucial for his personal and intellectual development. During this time, he absorbed various cultural influences, honed his literary skills under the guidance of prominent teachers, established connections with influential figures, and delved into profound emotions fueled by love. These factors undoubtedly contributed to shaping his literary genius and defining his status as one of the greatest writers of all time."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In 1924 he participated with the Czechoslovak team in the first Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament . - The 1924 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921. - The International Olympic Committee (IOC; French: Comit√© international olympique, CIO) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement. It is an international, non-profit, non-governmental organization based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Its mission is enshrined in the Olympic Charter: to support the development of competitive sport by ethical and environmentally sustainable means. - Haute-Savoie (or ' or ') is a department in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region of eastern France, bordering both Switzerland and Italy. Its capital is Annecy. To the north is Lake Geneva and Switzerland; to the south and southeast are the Mont Blanc and Aravis mountain ranges. The French entrance to the Mont Blanc Tunnel to Italy is in Haute-Savoie. It is noted for winter sports; the first Winter Olympic Games were held at Chamonix in 1924. - Mont Blanc or Monte Bianco, both meaning \\"White Mountain\\", is the highest mountain in the Alps and the highest in Europe after the Caucasus peaks. It rises above sea level and is ranked 11th in the world in topographic prominence. - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. - The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"Iers Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), were a winter multi-sport event which was held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. Originally called \\"Semaine Internationale des Sports d'Hiver\\" (\\"International Winter Sports Week\\") and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, the sports competitions were held at the foot of Mont Blanc in Chamonix, and Haute-Savoie, France between January 25 and February 5, 1924. The Games were organized by the French Olympic Committee, and were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the I Olympic Winter Games. - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time. - Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, more commonly known simply as Chamonix (formerly also spelled Chamounix), is a commune in the Haute-Savoie d√©partement in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France.

Write some highlights for the following article: Former French President Jacques Chirac was found guilty Thursday on corruption charges stemming from his time as mayor of Paris and given a two-year suspended sentence, a court in the French capital announced. He was convicted of breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and illegal use of influence, the Paris Court's press office said. Chirac did not attend the trial, which was held from September 5-23, due to his medical condition, which doctors described as a \\"severe\\" and \\"irreversible\\" neurological problem. In a statement released later Thursday, Chirac, 79, said that while he \\"categorically refuse(s) this ruling,\\" he would not appeal the verdict. \\"Unfortunately I no longer have all the strength necessary to carry the fight for truth by myself and face of new panel of judges,\\" Chirac said in the statement. \\"I also realize that what is at stake is not only the honour of a man, but the dignity of the presidential office.\\" An aide to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Elysee, or presidential palace, would not comment on the verdict, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. Francois Hollande, the presidential candidate from the Socialist party, said Thursday that \\"justice has been done, and it had to be done, so that there would be no sense of impunity.\\" However, he said, he did have some sympathy for Chirac. \\"Although the sentence is severe, it is both criminal and moral, and it affects him,\\" Hollande added, according to Le Monde. Ecologist party presidential candidate Eva Joly declared that justice has been done. \\"No citizen is above the law, if we want to reestablish trust in the justice system and democracy,\\" she said in a statement on her website. She also called on Chirac to resign from France's Constitutional Council, a body that decides if proposed laws are constitutional. Chirac and other former French presidents automatically serve on the council. Jerome Karsenti, of the anti-corruption group Anticor, lauded the ruling as \\"a historic decision and extremely important for the future of democracy. It's a message to all politicians.\\" Chirac was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president. He had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France, from 1995 to 2007. He was accused -- along with the other defendants -- of using public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and to pay others to perform jobs that did not really exist. Former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe was sentenced in December 2004 for his role in the affair. After Chirac left office as president, he made it known he was available to answer any questions on the matter. He always denied wrongdoing.

Passage: The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010‚Äì11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92‚Äì84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88‚Äì73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0‚Äì2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22‚Äì5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88‚Äì86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112‚Äì103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105‚Äì95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Creating questions from a given passage that involve complex reasoning. Usage: What combination of events led to the Mavs winning their first ever NBA title in 2011? Explanation: This question requires examining multiple parts of the passage, such as the Mavericks comebacks, strategic changes, and key players' performances to understand that the team's overall efforts and adaptations contributed to their victory. Part #2: Generating questions that require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Usage: How much did Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry collectively score in the final game of the 2011 NBA Finals? Explanation: This question requires looking at two different parts of the passage: Nowitzki scored 21 points, while Terry scored 27 points off the bench in the final game. The answer is obtained by adding these numbers together (21+27=48). Part #3: Using a variety of reasoning types and answer types in questions. Usage: In which game of the series did both the Mavericks and Heat break 100 points, and what was the final score? Explanation: This question utilizes numerical reasoning and requires the respondent to identify the specific game (Game 5) and remember the final score (112‚Äì103). The answer type is a combination of a number (game) and a span (final score). Part #4: Creating questions with answer type \\"number\\" and starting them with \\"How many\\". Usage: How many points did Nowitzki average per game during the 2011 NBA Finals series? Explanation: This question meets the criteria of starting with \\"How many\\" and having a numerical answer type by asking for Nowitzki's average points per game. The answer is 26 points. Part #5: Encouraging more challenging questions and using different combinations of arithmetic operations. Usage: How many more points did the Mavericks score in total in games 4, 5, and 6 compared to games 1, 2, and 3? Explanation: This question requires complex reasoning and multiple arithmetic operations: adding the scores of games 4, 5, and 6 (total: 329 points), adding the scores of games 1, 2, and 3 (total: 262 points), and then calculating the difference between the two sums (329 - 262 = 67 points)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: The Bad Santa‚Äôs Christmas sack is coming but this year it is not only the usual suspects who are feeling the big chill. By seasonal custom it is the humble basement bosses in the Premier League who check whether their P45s come through the letter box with the greetings cards. Now, if not facing festive dismissal quite yet, one or two of the big boys are beginning to sense that the skids could be under them. Yaya Toure, Raheem Sterling and Lukas Podolski looks dejected after a week of disappointment in Europe. Europe is the destination of choice for the major clubs but when Champions League matches go the way they have in the past few days these can be perilous journeys for the managers. Who would have thought, as recently as a week ago, that Manuel Pellegrini, Arsene Wenger and Brendan Rodgers would be planning extra helpings not of turkey and Christmas pudding but hard tack. Let us consider them in turn:. SENOR PELLEGRINI spent the latter part of this Wednesday evening confessing that his costly Manchester City have lost nerve, faith, confidence and, potentially most damaging of all for himself, trust. Just one win in five matches speaks to the truth of that self-wounding assessment and had that solitary victory not come against Manchester United then Pellegrini would be on even slipperier ground already. Manuel Pellegrini has won just one of his last five games as Manchester City have started to stumble. Seydou Doumbia (centre) did the damage with CSKA Moscow's goals in their 2-1 win over Manchester City. How far have the English champions fallen? As low as losing at home to a distinctly ordinary CSKA Moscow and having two of their prima donnas sent off during that humiliating process. Pellegrini answers to foreign owners who regard the Champions League as the Holy Grail. City captain Vincent Kompany looks disappointed at the end of the defeat by CSKA Moscow. City‚Äôs prospects of surviving a relatively easy group depend now on Bayern Munich, who have already qualified, either sending their reserves to the Etihad or treating that fixture as a practice match. Feliz Navidad, Manuel. MONSIEUR WENGER whiled away his Tuesday evening watching Arsenal throw away a three-goal lead at home against the Belgian lightweights of Anderlecht. The boos rained down in North London as he turned away from the scene of that debacle. The fans, let alone the directors, can see that this team are, quite literally, defenceless. Even the most respectful of former players are beginning to query why the manager has not bought top-class centre-backs. It looked as if Arsene Wenger would have an easy night when Arsenal went 3-0 up against Anderlecht... But the Arsenal manager could hardly look as his side threw away their three-goal lead at the Emirates. That question would be asked with greater urgency right now if Arsenal were not still in position to go through to the last 16. For the moment, it is being conveniently forgotten that Wenger‚Äôs esoteric ensemble would be scrambling to advance had they not been fortunate enough to pull a last-gasp victory out of a wretched performance at Anderlecht in the preceding match. As it is they are looking at second place, yet again, with its implicit danger of a deadly draw in the next round. And, like City, they have not started the Premier League season at all well. Arsenal pair Santi Cazorla and Lukas Podolski look dejected after throwing away a three goal lead. The Arsenal board are historically patient and respectful of Wenger, who achieved so much in his early years there. But for how much longer? Joyeux Noel, Arsene. MISTER RODGERS, meanwhile, splashed through only the first half of his sudden watershed on Tuesday. By scorning the highest European tradition with his decision to send a weakened Liverpool team into Real Madrid‚Äôs fabled Bernabeu, this manager has impaled himself on the imperative of his rested first-teamers defeating Chelsea at Anfield this weekend. Or at least avoiding defeat. If Liverpool lose this one ‚Äì and slump even further adrift of the Premier League leaders ‚Äì the carrion will make a meal of Rodgers come Saturday lunchtime. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the Liverpool side he sent out to face Real Madrid. If so, that feast will come early. Rodgers was so recently hailed as the saviour of Anfield that a descent into doubt this soon seemed impossible. He is bringing it in part upon himself. Far be it from a sportswriter to advise a manager to turn off the quotes tap but Rodgers really needs to put thinking time between brain and mouth. As an example of his tendency to damage himself, how about this cracker at the dinner in May at which the Uruguayan Dracula of the game was dubiously installed as our Footballer of the Year: ‚ÄòI am a better person for knowing Luis Suarez.‚Äô In the end Rodgers and Liverpool only lost to the European champions by one goal. Nor, judging from his jocular appearance at subsequent training, does he understand even now the implications of a club of Liverpool‚Äôs European pedigree playing for damage limitation rather than glory at the Bernabeu. Among the chorus of disapproval, one Anfield legend asked: ‚ÄòWhat is the point of making qualification for next season‚Äôs Champions League the priority when you are playing Real Madrid this week?‚Äô Rodgers, in training with Glen Johnson, appeared to be over the Madrid defeat at training on Thursday morning. That is not a question which will sit comfortably on his CV if ever he tries to pursue his professed ambition to manage in the upper echelons of La Liga. Worse still if Liverpool go out to ‚Äì er - Basle. Merry Christmas, Brendan. Despite being held to a draw in Slovenia by the moderates of Maribor, Chelsea‚Äôs Jose Mourinho is iceberg proof this winter. Not only is he virtually certain of reaching the Champions League last 16 but Chelsea are top of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho is sitting pretty in Europe despite a midweek draw and his team are flying high in the league. However, the English game at large needs higher quality performances from Chelsea as much as from City, Arsenal and Liverpool... and Manchester United for that matter. This Champions League week ‚Äì and not for the first time - has not cast the Premier League in a flattering light. Chelsea's Nemanja Matic celebrates his goal with teammates during the draw with Maribor. The best league in the world? Not even close unless the marquee clubs raise their game considerably, starting this weekend with Liverpool and Chelsea putting on a spectacle, Manchester City and United dazzling QPR and Crystal Palace respectively and Arsenal grafting substance onto style at Swansea.

Paragraph: After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Anna for the following movie plot: Two emotionally estranged sisters, Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and Anna (Gunnel Lindblom), and Anna's son, Johan (J√É¬∂rgen Lindstr√É¬∂m), a boy of 10, are on a night train journey back home. Ester, the older sister and a literary translator, is seriously ill. Anna coldly assists her, seemingly resenting the burden. They decide to interrupt the journey in the next town called \\"Timoka\\", located in a fictitious Central European country with an incomprehensible language and on the brink of war. The sisters rent a two-room-apartment in a once-grandiose hotel. Ester suffers in her room, self-medicating with vodka and cigarettes while trying to work. Johan soon begins wandering around the hotel's hallways, encountering the elderly hotel porter and a group of Spanish dwarves who are part of a traveling show. Meanwhile, Anna ventures into the city and is openly advanced upon by a waiter in a cafe. Later, she watches a show in an uncrowded theatre, and is both repelled and fascinated when a young couple begin to have sex in a seat nearby. Anna returns to the cafe, brushes past the waiter, and returns to the hotel in time. Left with Johan while his mother is out, Ester attempts to form a more intimate bond with him, but Johan avoids her attempts to stroke his hair and face. On Anna's return, Ester is eager for an account of what her sister has done after seeing her soiled dress. Provoked, Anna spitefully fabricates a sexual encounter with the waiter to her sister. Anna also reveals her intention to meet him again that evening, which Ester, not wanting to be left alone, begs her not to do. Anna meets the man in their hotel, and Johan witnesses them kissing and entering a room down an adjacent hall. Upon returning to the room, he asks Ester, why his mother dislikes being with them, as she always departs as soon as she gets the chance. Ester tells him that she has learned a few words of the local language, and she promises to write them down for him. Johan, instinctively knowing Ester is seriously ill, embraces her in a show of...

Provide a detailed answer so user don‚Äôt need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","completion":"Sample B rocks, from the Atacama Desert, would have less chemical reactions compared to Sample A rocks from the Amazon Rainforest. This is because the Atacama Desert receives one of the lowest rainfalls in the world, which means less rainwater is available to pass through the soil and react chemically with the particles. Consequently, the rate of weathering in Sample B is lower than in Sample A, where high rainfall leads to a greater number of chemical reactions and an increased rate of weathering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She will be eligible for parole after she serves 35 years and sobbed in court as she addressed Cash‚Äôs parents. 'If there's anything I could do to take the pain away and bring it on myself I would,' Cullen said. 'I'm so sorry I'll never forgive myself and never expect anyone else to either.' The jury was not able to hear about Cullen's previous abuse of children while at previous day care jobs, but the judge was allowed to use the information for sentencing purposes.

By the time he arrived at the house,. she had already administered CPR unsuccessfully and the pair rushed to the. emergency room.

Finally, she admitted that at around 8am she had tripped on the stairs and Cash had dropped onto the tile floor. In. the course of the trial, it has emerged that the Bells hired Cullen not. knowing that she had been fired from a day care center for being too. rough with the children.

Title: Disappointing Experience at The Gourmet Bistro I visited The Gourmet Bistro last Saturday night with high expectations after reading several glowing reviews online. Unfortunately, my experience left me deeply disappointed and dissatisfied. Upon our arrival, it took almost 15 minutes for the staff to acknowledge our presence and guide us to our table despite having a reservation. The overall ambiance was poor ‚Äì the lighting was too dim, and tables were cramped together, making it challenging to hold a conversation without feeling like we were encroaching on our neighbors' space. The food was subpar in comparison to the praise I had read in other reviews. We started with the baked brie appetizer, which was overly greasy and lacked flavor. The bread accompanying it was slightly stale. Our entrees were nothing to write home about. I opted for the Pan-Seared Salmon, which was served with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. The Salmon was overcooked, dry, and lacked seasoning, while the garlic mashed potatoes were bland and lacked the promised garlic flavor. The only saving grace was the green beans, which were cooked just right with a slight crunch. My partner's Chicken Marsala was similarly lackluster ‚Äì the sauce was thin and watery, not the rich and velvety Marsala sauce one would expect. The chicken was rubbery and appeared to be of low quality. We decided to skip dessert as we lost confidence in the kitchen's ability to deliver. Our server, although polite, appeared to be overwhelmed and inattentive. Drinks took far too long to be served, and we had to remind about our order twice. The overall service was slow and seemed disorganized. To top it off, the prices at The Gourmet Bistro were steep, considering the disappointing food quality and poor overall experience. I was expecting a fine dining experience for the price, but unfortunately, what we received was closer to that of a mediocre chain restaurant. In summary, my experience at The Gourmet Bistro was a letdown. I cannot recommend this restaurant to others based on the issues in the ambiance, food quality, service, and high prices. As someone who had high hopes for a lovely evening out, I regret choosing this establishment and can only hope that others heed my warning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

El hecho llev√≥ a que el ministro de Comunicaci√≥n de ese pa√≠s renunciara de su cargo durante una rueda de prensa. Chinchilla viaj√≥ a Per√∫ para participar en la boda del hijo del vicepresidente costarricense Luis Liberman en Per√∫. La prensa tica revel√≥ que el vuelo de Chinchilla fue \\"regalado\\" por una empresa de capital canadiense, la cual se dedica a la extracci√≥n de petr√≥leo. Francisco Chac√≥n, ahora ex ministro de Comunicaci√≥n del gobierno de Chinchilla, argument√≥ durante la rueda de prensa en la cual puso su renuncia que \\"la compa√±√≠a que yo defend√≠ como una compa√±√≠a incuestionable result√≥ no serlo\\". Chac√≥n revel√≥ el nombre de un exfutbolista costarricense, quien labora para la empresa, que regal√≥ el vuelo a Chinchilla. El monto del viaje de la mandataria a Per√∫ durante los dos d√≠as que estuvo fuera del pa√≠s se calcula en USD 60 000. Por ese viaje, la presidenta se encuentra siendo investigada en este momento en instancias judiciales para determinar si hay un conflicto de intereses con la empresa. El empresario que se encuentra detr√°s del avi√≥n en que viaj√≥ Chinchilla es el colombiano Gabriel Morales, quien se encuentra investigado por tr√°fico de drogas.

La misma empresa facilit√≥ el vuelo que Chinchilla realiz√≥ para participar en las honras f√∫nebres de Hugo Ch√°vez en Venezuela.

His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \\"Dorian,\\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \\"Hook her up,\\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet.

He took a deep breath, preparing himself for what was to come, and started connecting the unconscious young woman to the various machines and monitoring equipment that surrounded her. His hands shook slightly, both from fear and uncertainty of the situation, as well as the concern for his friend and colleague. Dorian, meanwhile, was working furiously at the computer, typing in commands and pulling up data faster than Cedric had ever seen him work before. Something was definitely wrong, something that pushed Dorian to the edge of panic and desperation. Cedric couldn't help but wonder what could have driven Dorian to bring this woman into the lab, in the middle of the night no less, and what he hoped to accomplish with whatever risky experiments he had in mind. Once all the connections were made, Cedric glanced over at Dorian, looking for some explanation or reassurance that would ease his growing fears. Dorian must have sensed Cedric's unease because, for a brief moment, he paused and looked back at his friend. Though it was fleeting, Cedric could see a hint of vulnerability in Dorian's eyes, a silent plea for trust and support. Then, just as quickly, it was gone, and Dorian resumed his frantic work at the computer. With a final deep breath, Cedric steeled himself and started the process of initiating the experimental procedure, knowing full well that what they were doing was potentially very dangerous. There was no turning back now. His loyalty to Dorian overcame his fear and uncertainty. As the machinery whirred to life, an ominous feeling settled over the room.

Every artist needs a portfolio -- the place where potential buyers or clients can see your work. Luckily, the internet is making it easy as website design spaces like Wix.com, SquareSpace, and Wordpress all have templates designed for artists portfolios. All you have to do is customize the name, color, and bio, then import images or videos of your art. Purchase a custom domain name if you are looking for professional clients. A site like www.MyPortfolio.wordpress.com looks much less professional than www.MyPortfolio.com. When done, attach this portfolio to all your social media accounts to make it easy to find. Consider printing (or drawing/designing, for memorable flair) some business cards to get the word around. Contact small galleries near you to see if you can put some work up. Look into that restaurant or coffee shop that puts work on the walls. And, if all else fails, throw your own art show. All you need is a space to hang everything, some refreshments, and friends willing to come and support you. Try to host shows with multiple artists when possible. That way, everyone brings their own friend groups so each artist can meet new fans. You never know if you can display your work unless you ask. Don't be intimidated -- they absolute worst thing that happens is the word, \\"no.\\" Consider hosting \\"open studio\\" session once a month, where friends and curious spectators can watch you work and talk about your process. Few, if any, artists are so skilled that they can't benefit from some kind of formal instruction. Art classes can help you get past problems with your work that you haven't been able to solve on your own, identify areas in which you could improve, or just give you some direction and a regular time to devote to working on art. There are courses available for all skill levels at colleges, community centers, local arts centers, and numerous other places. Your teacher and fellow students are essential contacts as you build your career. They can point to new opportunities, team up with you for shows, and support your work in the difficult early years when you're still unknown. Never discount a connection or friend. In the word-of-mouth driven art scene, a wide, strong social network is king. It isn't always a ton of fun, but it is absolutely essential if you intend to be a professional. No one wants to champion your art but you. And, in its own way, this is a good thing-- you no longer have to hope the \\"right\\" person shows up in your gallery. Instead, hard work online can get your work into many corners of the internet, and even make some money. If you make smaller, sellable art pieces, consider a shop on Etsy or eBay. Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest, with their large pictures and big art networks, are great places to share and see work. Pick 1-2 social media accounts to run and stick with those. Trying to work on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. all at once is impossible to do well without spending all day on the internet. Artists need to stick together, and many of the greats have come from collectives and groups. It is no mistake that many famous artists knew each other before striking it big, and some of the greatest moments in art (Paris in the 40's, NY in the 80's) come from shared creative communities. So go to local shows, enroll in classes, and collaborate with other artists. A rising tide carries all boats, so get out there and make some waves. If you're struggling to find a community, look online. There are tons of forums, sites, and communities (like the famous DeviantArt) that allow you to showcase work. Pay attention to your contemporaries, supporting their own shows and work. When you are first starting out, your best network will be artists in the same situation. If you don't make art a daily priority, then it's going to be really hard to be a good artist. That is just the reality of practice-- all the talent in the world doesn't help if you don't sit down and make art. Honestly, this may require some sacrifices in terms of work hours, salary, and living situation. But if you want to be a professional artist, none of this should matter. You get to make art every single day! Always remember, especially in the early years of practice, that all of your favorite artists went through the same process.

Given the following passage \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\", answer the following question.

They would score first as Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 5-yard pass for a 7-0 lead. The Dolphins managed to get on the board as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 30-yard field goal making the score 7-3.

Answer the question Jake's cats eat food from a can. The cats come running into the kitchen when they hear the electric can opener. Now, each time Jake's mother opens a can of corn, the cats come running. This is an example of OPTIONS: 1). learned behavior; 2). correct behavior; 3). instinct; 4). migration;","completion":"To find the answer, let's analyze each option and choose the one that best describes the situation with Jake's cats. 1) Learned behavior: This implies that the cats have learned to associate a specific stimulus (the sound of the electric can opener) with a particular outcome (getting food). 2) Correct behavior: This refers to an action or response that is considered appropriate or suitable in a given context. In this case, the cats' behavior is not necessarily correct as they are coming running for corn, not their usual cat food. 3) Instinct: This refers to an innate, natural, or hardwired behavior that animals are born with and do not have to learn. The cats in this scenario have learned to associate the sound of the can opener with food, so it is not an instinctual behavior. 4) Migration: This refers to periodic, usually seasonal, movement of animals from one region to another. This option is not related to the situation of the cats and the can opener at all. After evaluating each option, we can conclude that the best answer to describe the cats' behavior in this situation is: 1) learned behavior. The cats have learned to associate the sound of the electric can opener with getting food, so they come running each time they hear it, regardless of the type of canned food being opened."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential, is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring, faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated, however, when he meets Jane's friend and classmate, the egotistical Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela, much to his daughter's embarrassment. Throughout the film, Lester has fantasies involving a sexually aggressive Angela and red rose petals. The Burnhams' new neighbors are Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper), his distracted wife Barbara (Allison Janney), and his camcorder-obsessed son Ricky (Wes Bentley). When confronted with the gay couple living two doors down, Col. Fitts displays a distinctly bigoted attitude.Over the course of a few days, each of the Burnhams individually makes a life-changing choice. Carolyn meets real estate rival Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) for a business lunch and ends up beginning an affair with him, and later takes up shooting lessons (a suggestion of Kane's). Lester blackmails his boss Brad Dupree (Barry Del Sherman) for 60,000, quits his job, and takes up low-pressure employment as a burger-flipper at a fast food chain. He continues to liberate himself by trading in his Toyota Camry for his dream car, a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, starts working out to impress Angela, and starts smoking a genetically enhanced form of marijuana.

Suddenly she receives an urgent call on her monitor from none other than the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin). He informs her that a young scientist named Durand-Durand went missing sometime during a mission to the North Star and is believed to have landed somewhere in the Tau Ceti star system. Not much is known about this region of space-- the President worries that Durand's invention, the positronic ray, may fall into the hands of a primitive culture; beings who might seek to use this technology as a weapon and launch an intergalactic war. Since the Earth, free of all conflict for centuries, lacks military and police personnel, the President tasks Barbarella with a mission to find the scientist. He teleports her some weapons and a device that will signal the presence of Durand-Durand. The latter has a \\"tonguebox\\" incorporated in its design which can translate any language.Barbarella spends most of the journey to Tau Ceti in suspended animation. She awakens just in time to lose control of her spacecraft and crash land on Planet 16, which her spaceship informs her contains an atmosphere similar to Earth's. She changes into a new outfit to explore the arctic terrain. The first humanoids she meets are a pair of twin girls-- they jabber to her excitedly in a language she can't understand.

Do this for at least 30 minutes to work your shoulders and arms and burn approximately 150 calories. Instead of sitting on your knees and leaning forward, you can stand straight and squat, trying to stay balanced. Apply your cleaning product, brush the toilet and wipe clean. Just like sweeping the floor, you should flex your stomach and oblique muscles and keep your back straight. Pull as far away as possible and squat, rather than bend, to pick up the leaves. This activity can be extended to other garden activities, such as mowing the lawn, flower planting, composting or general gardening. These activities, when done for at least 1/2 hour, will result in burning between 150 and 190 calories. Try to keep your back straight, as many people can end up with lower back strain. Moving furniture in good form, by bending your knees and straightening your back, is a form of weightlifting. Move each piece of furniture slightly and vacuum behind and replace it again. Use large sweeping motions and smaller motions. Reach up high with your vacuum extension. Vacuuming a house can burn approximately 80 calories, where moving furniture can burn over 200 calories. Use a knee pad or do deep squats while you reach the corners with a cleaning product and a brush. Mopping the floors burns just a portion of the 190 calories you can burn by hand-cleaning 1 floor. Grab a sponge, some mild liquid detergent, water and a bucket and wash all areas of the car. Use long sweeping motions to get hard to reach places and squat down to clean tires and the running board. Cleaning your car by hand can burn approximately 150 calories and work your arms, core muscles, and legs. Fill a bathtub with water, laundry detergent and dirty clothes. Rub the clothes against themselves and each other for 10 to 20 minutes. Rinse the clothes twice in fresh water and squeeze to dry. For more delicate items, allow them to hang and drip dry or lay flat. Be careful not to lean too far into the bathtub, as that can put extra strain on your back.

A video has emerged of terrifying moment a tornado hit an elementary school in Oklahoma. As they huddle in a bathroom, teachers can be heard trying to reassure their terrified students as the twister tears up Briarwood Elementary, one of schools hit by Monday's twister. The clip starts with teacher Robin Dziedzic filming in a pitch black bathroom with her students as they try to seek shelter. Horrifying: As they huddle in a bathroom, teachers can be heard trying to reassure their terrified students as they twister tears up Briarwood Elementary, one of two Oklahoma City-area schools hit by Monday's twister. Mayhem: The school corridor after being ripped apart by the twister - no-one at the school was killed. Dawning: A classroom which less than an hour before was in pristine condition is now wrecked. The only source of light is from a bulb in the corner of the room. Mrs Dziedzic, a fifth grade teacher, can be heard trying to reassure the terrified students telling them: 'It's almost over, it's almost over.' A student cries out 'I hate this' as the 200pmh winds swirl outside the tiny room. 'Keep your heads down,' instructs one of the teachers as the air pushes down on the students. Carnage: The first site Robin Dziedzic sees after emerging from the pitch black bathroom. Transformation: Dazed students wander the corridor, shocked at the change in the school. Obliterated: As the teachers and students emerge from the school, the full scale of the devastation can be seen. Dazed: Shocked and teary students stand outside the school as the carnage in revealed. Reunited: Mrs Dziedzic finds her son Sam, a first grader, who also attended the school. As the full force of the tornado rips through the school, cries of terror and screams can be heard from the students. The video, filmed on a cellphone,. then shows the students emerging from the darkness and seeing for the. first time the full scale of devastation. The school corridor is strewn with. debris, mud and insulator foam and the dazed students can be seen walking around. the building in horror. Mrs Dziedzic, evidently in shock, can just be heard repeating 'Oh my god, oh my god.' Devastated: Robin Dziedzic surveys the scene in shock as she revisits the school. Destruction: Robin Dziedzic walks down the tornado-damaged corridor- the bathroom she sheltered in is behind the wall. Poignant: Robin Dziedzic opens the door to her bathroom which saved the life of her and her students. The footage then cuts to outside the school where the land is completely obliterated. Terrified students gather in the land outside as Mrs Dziedzic searches for her two children who are also at the school- her son Sam, a first grader and daughter Mairi, a fourth grader. Sam finds her in the crowd and her husband, who arrives at the scene tracks down Mairi - the pair hug in a sobbing embrace. ABC News took Mrs Dziedzic back to revisit the ravaged school for the first time. She was emotional pointed out the. first grade classroom where her son's teacher lay on top of him to keep. him and other students safe. She walked down the corridor- one of. the only walls still standing in the school - to revisit the bathroom. which provided shelter for her and the students.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where were the cowboys herding the heifers across the property towards? A. deep sea B. slaughterhouse C. cattle ranch D. countryside E. barnyard The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"C. cattle ranch Cowboys were primarily responsible for herding cattle, which were typically raised on large, sprawling properties known as cattle ranches. These ranches often covered vast areas of land, complete with open grasslands and natural resources necessary for raising healthy livestock. Cowboys would manage, corral, and drive the heifers towards various sections of the property to ensure their herds had access to fresh grazing areas and water sources. The other options provided do not accurately represent the environments or intended destinations for cowboys herding heifers: A. deep sea - Cowboys and their herds would certainly not venture into the deep sea. Not only is it geographically improbable, but it would also be detrimental to both the cowboys and the cattle in their charge. B. slaughterhouse - While some cattle would eventually be taken to slaughterhouses, the cowboys' primary responsibility was to maintain and manage the herds. They might occasionally be involved in transporting cattle to markets, but not directly to slaughterhouses. D. countryside - The term \\"countryside\\" is vague and could potentially encompass the grasslands and open areas found within cattle ranches. However, it is not a specific destination typically associated with cowboys herding heifers. E. barnyard - Barnyards are more commonly associated with smaller-scale farms rather than the cattle-centric ranches of the cowboy era. Cowboys would have been more focused on managing their herds in open pastures rather than navigating barnyard settings. In summary, the best answer for where cowboys would be herding heifers across their property is C. cattle ranch. It is here where the livestock would have access to necessary resources, such as food and water, for a healthy existence under the watchful eye of the cowboys."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To summarise the effects of anthelmintic drug treatment on growth and cognitive performance in children. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group controlled trial register, Cochrane controlled trials register, Embase, and Medline. Citations of all identified trials. Contact with the World Health Organization and field researchers. REVIEW METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials in children aged 1-16 that compared anthelmintic treatment with placebo or no treatment. Assessment of validity and data abstraction conducted independently by two reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Growth and cognitive performance. RESULTS Thirty randomised controlled trials in more than 15 000 children were identified. Effects on mean weight were unremarkable, and heterogeneity was evident in the results. There were some positive effects on mean weight change in the trials reporting this outcome: after a single dose (any anthelmintic) the pooled estimates were 0.24 kg (95% confidence interval 0.15 kg to 0. 32 kg; fixed effects model assumed) and 0.38 kg (0.01 kg to 0.77 kg; random effects model assumed). Results from trials of multiple doses showed mean weight change in up to one year of follow up of 0.10 kg (0.04 kg to 0.17 kg; fixed effects) or 0.15 kg (0.00 to 0.30; random effects). At more than one year of follow up, mean weight change was 0.12 kg (-0.02 kg to 0.26 kg; fixed effects) and 0.43 (-0.61 to 1. 47; random effects). Results from studies of cognitive performance were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS There is some limited evidence that routine treatment of children in areas where helminths are common has effects on weight gain, but this is not consistent between trials. There is insufficient evidence as to whether this intervention improves cognitive performance..

Once you have added all of the mixture to your hair, consider pinning your hair up in a bun to keep your hair out of your face as you let the mixture soak in. Leave this mixture on your hair for at least an hour. After an hour, the conditioner may start to dry and harden. Apply this coffee mixture to your hair in a bathroom with a mirror so you can contain any mess and see what you‚Äôre doing. Drape an old towel (one you don‚Äôt mind getting messy) over your shoulders. This will prevent any of the coffee mixture from falling on your clothes and staining the fabric. Rinse the coffee and conditioner mixture out of your hair in the shower. Don‚Äôt add shampoo; simply let the water clean out the mixture from your hair. You may need to repeat this dyeing process a couple times to reach your desired results.","completion":"This article explains how to make and use a mixture of organic coffee, conditioner, and coffee grounds to naturally darken your hair by brewing strong coffee, mixing it with conditioner, applying the mixture to your hair, and rinsing it out after an hour."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you have a fever, headache and runny nose, you might go to Google and type in the words \\"flu symptoms\\" to see whether you've come down with the disease. Google knows that you might do something like that, and it also knows which state you're in if you are in the United States. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that could find out flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use, according to CNN report. It is called Google Flu Trends. \\"What's exciting about Flu Trends is that it lets anybody---doctors, health officials, moms with sick children---learn about the current flu activity level in their own state based on the data that's coming in this week,\\" said Jeremy Ginsberg, the lead engineer who developed the tool. The tool operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular. To test the accuracy of the data, Google compared its figures against statistics filed over the past five years by the US Centers for Disease Control. It has a network of 1,500 doctors across the US who provide weekly reports on the number of patients complaining of flu-like symptoms. \\"We found we could highly accurately estimate what the flu activity levels would be in those years,\\" Ginsberg said. They also found that the Google statistics, which can be gathered daily, were up to two weeks ahead of the government's data. The government's data took time to collect because it came from so many doctors. The ability to speed up the response of health services could prove invaluable when a serious outbreak happens. The results of Google's comparisons with official health statistics will be published in the science journal Nature. Google hopes to extend the service to other countries, and may in time include other illnesses. At present, the flu data is given for each of the 50 American states. The company says there are no privacy issues involved as the trends are gathered through... Which is NOT true according to the passage? A) The government's data mentioned in the passage came from a network of 1,500 doctors across the US. B) Google Flu Trends' reports can be one or two weeks ahead of those by the government. C) Google Flu Trends' estimates prove quite accurate and reliable. D) Anyone around the world can enjoy the service of Google Flu Trends. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D) Anyone around the world can enjoy the service of Google Flu Trends.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence.\\", is the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the given sentence, \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence,\\" it is possible to consider the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard\\" as a true statement with some interpretation. However, there are certain differences and limitations that must be taken into account when evaluating both sentences. First, let's analyze the original sentence: \\"The boy is skateboarding on the bench by the fence.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"the boy,\\" who is performing the action of skateboarding. The location is specified as \\"on the bench by the fence.\\" This gives a more precise description of the activity and location than the second sentence. Now let's move to the second sentence: \\"The person is on his skateboard.\\" The subject in this sentence is \\"the person,\\" which could be a reference to \\"the boy\\" in the original sentence, but it is not as specific. Additionally, the verb in this sentence is \\"is,\\" with the prepositional phrase \\"on his skateboard\\" providing more information about the subject's activity. This sentence does convey the idea that the subject is using a skateboard, but it lacks the details about the exact action, such as \\"skateboarding.\\" Furthermore, the location of this activity is not mentioned in this sentence, unlike the original sentence. Given the analysis above, it can be said that the sentence \\"The person is on his skateboard\\" indeed represents a true statement when considering certain aspects of the original sentence. However, it is a more general and less detailed representation of the original situation. It lacks the specificity that \\"the boy\\" provides in the original sentence and omits the information about the activity and the location (\\"skateboarding on the bench by the fence\\"). In conclusion, the second sentence is true in the sense that it conveys the idea of someone using a skateboard, but it falls short in capturing the full context and details of the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

He wears a white badge on his shirt that says \\"happy birthday\\" in Chinese characters.The first scene opens on a butterfly perched on a somewhat puzzling structure; the boy, inside, is singing. When he comes out, the camera pulls back to show that the puzzling structure is the wreck of a plane that crashed into a building.Manuk makes his way through the village to a railroad track, where he puts his ear to the rail to listen for a train. Evidently he hears one coming; he lays a bolt taken from the plane on the rail, where the train flattens it. The train is hauling tanks.The boy picks up the flattened bolt and finds that it's been magnetized. He continues to a spot that overlooks the tracks. Seeing war planes in the distance, he pretends to shoot at them, exchanges a few urgent words with an imagined fellow soldier -- \\"Dad\\" -- and throws a rock grenade that hits a postman on a bicycle.Arriving home at last, Manuk opens a package he finds on the porch. He pulls out a worn wallet containing a picture of himself and a young man, a set of dog tags, and a boot.

Do these mean the same? After his death , the atheistic element of communism would be stepped up in some Marxist movements . After his death , the Marxist element of communism would be strengthened in some atheistic movements .","completion":"While these two sentences appear similar at first glance, they actually convey different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to understand their individual meanings and the distinctions between them. 1. After his death, the atheistic element of communism would be stepped up in some Marxist movements. This sentence implies that, following the individual's passing, the atheism aspect within communism would become more prominent or influential in certain Marxist movements. This statement assumes that those specific Marxist movements already have a connection to or component of communism with an atheistic element. The focus of this sentence is on the growth or increased influence of atheism within these Marxist movements. 2. After his death, the Marxist element of communism would be strengthened in some atheistic movements. In this sentence, the focus shifts from the atheistic element to the Marxist element within communism. It suggests that, after the person's death, the influence or presence of Marxism within certain atheistic movements would be strengthened or intensified. In other words, the sentence implies that these atheistic movements may or may not have already had an association with communism, but the influence of Marxism within these movements would grow more substantial. In this case, the emphasis is on the growth or increased influence of Marxism within these atheistic movements. To sum up, the key difference between these two sentences lies in the elements being emphasized: - In the first sentence, the importance lies on the fact that \\"the atheistic element of communism\\" is increased within some Marxist movements. - Meanwhile, in the second sentence, the focus is on how \\"the Marxist element of communism\\" gets strengthened within some atheistic movements. Although both sentences discuss the growth or increased influence of certain elements within different movements, they emphasize different aspects: the first one highlights the growth of atheism within Marxist movements, whereas the second one emphasizes the strengthening of Marxism within atheistic movements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are a number of ways to start off a session of analytical therapy (also known as imagination therapy), but getting the subject into a receptive state is essential. Try having them lay on a comfortable couch/sofa and close their eyes. They are not to go to sleep at any point. Use a soft, relaxing tone at all times when speaking to the subject. You can attempt to have them count down slowly from 100. For more tense patients, you can have them intentionally and systematically tense, hold, and then release each of their muscles. Controlled breathing also can work. The subject places their hands on their chest and belly--sometimes the hypnotist can do this part--while the subject breathes slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. Once your subject is in a receptive state, you need to narrow the sets of imagery you focus on. You can try some interesting experiments as long as you are careful. Select positive images like a holiday party, a graduation, a wedding, or a combination of multiple images in sequence to draw a correspondingly positive response out of the subject. If they need to relax, you may help them \\"construct\\" the images out of features the subject associates with positive emotions and memories. If you are helping a case of trauma, you may have them search for pleasant images to supplant horrific ones. There is a great deal of flexibility here, so this needs to be tailored to your subject's needs and perhaps discussed before the session. With so much range, you can make the mode of expression part of the experiment. Maybe having your subject drive their images around in a vehicle, or make a movie of their happiest memories would be something you can attempt. Perhaps having the subject going on an adventure within their own images could be quite an experience to try. Find a creative way to discard negative images in a symbolic way that allows the positive images to remain in place. Consider something literal like tossing the bad images in a trash can or projecting them on a screen so there is room in the mind for the pleasant imagery. Your subject is in a receptive state, but not asleep. You are guiding them. Steer the subject's images in a positive direction, but observe their responses carefully in case they are resisting. Maintain the calm steady tone of voice throughout the session. Suggest imagery that mixes positively with their existing responses. Be prepared to bring them out of the hypnotic state in the case of an adverse physical reaction. For experimental situations, you may take some time to find what techniques and images work best with the subject. And neither hypnotist nor subject should expect an instant cure, especially in trauma cases or when dealing with prolonged pain suffering. Establish from the outset that the hypnotic technique can take many sessions. Schedule a regular time/interval for the sessions. Both parties should bring up issues if they feel the sessions are not working as they expect. What is a summary?","completion":"Analytical therapy, also known as imagination therapy, involves guiding a subject into a relaxed and receptive state through techniques such as controlled breathing and muscle relaxation. Once the subject is in this state, the therapist helps them focus on positive images and experiences that evoke pleasant emotions and memories. This can be done in various ways, often tailored to the subject's needs and preferences. Throughout the session, the therapist maintains a calm and steady tone while observing the subject's responses and adjusting the imagery accordingly. For cases such as trauma or prolonged pain, multiple sessions may be required for the therapy to be effective. Establishing a regular schedule and discussing any concerns or expectations can help improve the therapy's success."},{"prompt":"Title: Powerful Results!

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: India (ISO: BhƒÅrat), also known as the Republic of India (ISO: BhƒÅrat Ga·πáarƒÅjya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country by area and with more than 1.3 billion people, it is the second most populous country as well as the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947. In 2017, the Indian economy was the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is looking at two samples of soil, sample A and sample B. Sample A is from Amazon Rain-forest, where they get one of the highest rainfall in the world. Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. Answer this question please: Would new surfaces be exposed or stay covered in sample A? Answer:","completion":"In sample A, which is from the Amazon Rainforest with one of the highest rainfall rates in the world, new surfaces would be exposed more frequently. This is because high rainfall leads to an increased amount of rainwater passing through the soil. As mentioned in the background, high rainfall also increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions, leading to more rapid weathering. Moreover, high rainfall can carry away materials, further contributing to the exposure of new surfaces. This process is in contrast to the situation in sample B, from the Atacama Desert, where low rainfall would result in less weathering and slower exposure of new surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, he emphasized that human error and the chaos surrounding the tragedy are likely the culprits rather than any sinister collusion. \\"I don't claim to have all the answers, but I can tell you that most of these claims just don't hold up when you examine them closely,\\" Perry added.

Question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the five friends who have been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade? is inside the article: This camp screwball comedy of errors, that includes many over-the-top stereotypes, is set at Halloween against the backdrop of West Hollywood, California. Five friends, interior designer Evan (played by London); interior designer Harvey (played by Cheng); African American stockbroker Dave (played by Meadows); Latino spinning instructor Fredrico (played by Sab√†to); and Emme (played by Ubach), a sassy young woman obsessed with style and classic movies, have all been anticipating the West Hollywood Halloween Parade on Santa Monica Boulevard, which is the biggest and brashest block party of the year. Their annual tradition of joining the festivities in outrageous costumes has become part of local legend. It is the night before Halloween, however, and they still have not decided what to be. Evan and Harvey, who are femme gay boyfriends and business partners, have come up with food-themed sushi costumes that everyone refers to as \\"wasabi tuna.\\" Emme offers another suggestion ‚Äî that they all dress up as gang members. They all opt for the gang theme, but are unable to find the appropriate attire at the local stores. They then decide to seek out real life gang members in order to achieve the authentic, straight-from-the-hood look they want. While doing interior design work for an extremely wealthy Armenian woman who is actually in the illegal drug trade, Harvey and Evan become unwitting drug couriers. After they are arrested, there is a comic scene at the WeHo sheriff's station with them attempting to talk their way out of trouble. Dave goes to East L.A., where he comes across a real gang member named Romeo (played by D√≠az). He makes a deal with Romeo to loan him his Porsche in exchange for his lowrider gang car. A case of mistaken identity makes a vengeful, rival gang get after them. There is a comic drive-by shooting scene.

The supplies consisting of 557 tents and 2,500 quilts, valued at 788,000 yuan (approximately US113,000), were flown by the Red Cross Society of China to Wenchuan County. Wenchuan County is located in the Sichuan province of China. The delivery of these supplies was a humanitarian effort to aid people affected by natural disasters or other emergency situations. Such aid and support are essential to ensure the well-being and recovery of the affected communities. It is important to note that the Red Cross Society of China is one of the largest humanitarian organizations in the country and works in collaboration with other international organizations to assist those in need. The relief efforts provided by the Red Cross Society of China, in this case, reflect the commitment to upholding the fundamental principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, which include humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The service will locate any buried power lines, pipes, and other underground utilities. It is vital to wait for this before starting any digging, to avoid serious injury or property damage. In the U.S. and Canada, you can call the toll-free \\"Digline\\" number at 811. Knowing the depth, width, and length of your trench will help you save effort and keep your trench the shape you desire. It may help you to mark widths, lengths and route of your trench using stakes and string. If available, you can use sandbags or other markers to outline the path of your trench. If you are using the trench to install or replace electrical utilities or pipelines, you will want to dig at least 2.5 feet deep in order to protect the pipes from frost, but no deeper than 4 feet. The width of your trench will depend on your pipes, but will likely be narrow. If you are digging a trench for a sprinkler system, you may only need to dig 9-12 inches deep depending on the height of the sprinkler, and 5 inches wide depending, again, depending on your sprinkler system. Consult the instructions that came with your sprinkler system before installation. You‚Äôll need a D-handle sharp shooter shovel and a trenching or clean-out shovel. These can be purchased at any hardware or gardening store. For clearing roots, pruning shear or a Pulaski digging tool can help you quickly remove this obstruction. Wearing gloves will protect your hand from blisters and splinters, and comfortable work boots will provide foot protection and traction. Be careful when you dig around trees or other pipes. Roots can add a significant time to your excavation, and a ruptured gas line will require you to call your gas provider immediately. Severed utility lines could also leave you without power until your electric company can fix the problem. If you're digging near trees, make sure that your trench will not invade the tree‚Äôs protected root zone (usually the part of the roots that lie directly below its branches). If you're digging near pipes, try to determine where any other pipes may be. New pipes should be at least 1.5 feet away from another. Use the D-handle shovel to loosen the dirt along both sides of the soon-to-be trench. This will make it easier to dig out the dirt in the middle while physically establishing your dig line alongside the guideline you laid. Cut both sides of the hole with your shovel, break up the topsoil, and then work both sides of your trench until you have loosened enough soil to merit clearing. Once you have accumulated enough loose soil, use the trenching shovel to remove it out of your way. This may be a pile off to the side, or it may be a location you choose prior specifically for backfill. Depending on the depth and length of your trench, this could take a considerable amount of time and effort. Use your D-handle shovel to break up the soil and the trench shovel to clean it out until your trench is the desired length and depth. Running into roots might require you to place the pointed end of your shovel on the root and stomp, which should sever most small-medium sized roots. More developed root systems might require a Pulaski digging tool. Pruning shears are another good option, if your shovel fails and you do not have a Pulaski digging tool on hand. An unsupported trench can be extremely dangerous, as collapsing soil can kill someone standing in the trench. Any trench 3 feet (0.91 m) (0.9m) deep, and some shallower trenches in soft soil, should be supported by side walls (such as timber posts and panels) before digging any deeper. You can increase safety by \\"benching\\" (digging in tiered levels), or by digging the walls at a slope instead of vertically. An experienced trench excavator may choose to keep the trench unsupported at depths up to 5 ft (1.5 m), but only under stable soil conditions. Follow the 3 ft (0.9 m) rule if you do not have expert supervision.","completion":"This service helps find hidden things underground like power lines and pipes. You must call 811 before digging so you won't get hurt or break things. You need to know how deep, wide, and long your trench should be. Use stakes and string to mark the area. If you put wires or pipes in the trench, it should be 2.5 feet to 4 feet deep. If for a sprinkler, only 9-12 inches deep and 5 inches wide. You need special shovels to dig and cut roots. Wear gloves and boots for protection. Do not damage tree roots or other pipes. Make the trench walls safe with wood or by digging at an angle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Cats Don't Dance Movie plot: In 1939, Danny, an optimistic cat, dreams of Hollywood stardom, so he travels from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood in hopes of starting a career there. After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios √¢¬Ä¬î such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth the head of Mammoth Studios, and Flanagan the film's director, is giving an interview, getting the animals blame and fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to leave for home, Cranston, Frances, and T.W. blame him for ruining their careers while Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny. After a comment from the bus driver... My question: Why did Danny traveled from Kokomo, Indiana to Hollywood?

He was passionate about pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and believed that Hollywood, being the center of the film and entertainment world, was the best place to achieve his dream. Upon reaching Hollywood, he hoped to land roles in movies and eventually become a well-known actor, making his mark on the industry and fulfilling his aspirations. Hollywood represented the ultimate destination for anyone in the entertainment industry, with its glamour, fame, and countless opportunities to work with talented individuals in various creative fields.

It was not until after Getty‚Äôs death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his ‚Äúranch‚Äù on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms‚ÄîGalleries 105 to 108‚Äîshare this history.

Please write a short summary for the following article: CATSKILLS REAWAKENING AFTER A LONG SLEEP LIBERTY, N.Y.‚Äî In the glittering resort hotels there is talk of casino gambling, while in the decaying towns the topic is unemployment and crime. But the center of discussion throughout the hills is the new face of the Catskills - people from New York City seeking second homes, a melange of off-brand religious groups who want isolation and artists needing cheap studios. After almost a century of dormancy, the Catskill Mountains - the 3,000-square-mile pastoral area spreading over Sullivan, Ulster and Orange Counties about 100 miles northwest of New York City - is confronting rapid growth and ethnic change. ''The image of the Catskills as the Borscht Belt is gone,'' said Brian Ingber, the 32-year-old Supervisor of the Town of Fallsburg in Sullivan County who is credited with attracting several Federal and state redevelopment grants for the area. ''The Catskills are going through a revival of a type never seen before here,'' he added. ''The population of Sullivan County shot up 23 percent between 1970 and 1980 as a lot of people suddenly found out that land was cheap here and either started speculating in property or buying second homes.'' Grossinger's, the legendary resort that stands on a hill overlooking this small town like a feudal manor, is still doing well, as are Brown's, the Concord, the Fallsview and a dozen or so major resorts. But over the last 20 years, perhaps 100 others have gone out of business, as have hundreds of bungalow colonies that were summer vacation homes for New Yorkers with low or moderate incomes. The lands they once occupied are being subdivided for second homes on plots of about an acre, or have been sold as package deals to the many religious groups moving in. The region, already noted for religious toleration, whether of Jewish splinter groups or followers of the late Father Devine, now seems inundated with gurus, swamis and saffron-robed Buddhist monks, who on weekend nights can be seen mingling with more somberly attired Hasidic Jews. Freshly painted directions on signposts point the way: Swami Muktananda has taken over the old Gilbert Hotel in South Fallsburg. Nearby, the old Winter Hotel is now the Capital of the Age of the Enlightenment, a transcendental-meditation movement headed by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. A second such center is at the old Walde-mere Hotel in Shandelle. The Sivandada Yoga Ranch has set up shop in Woodbourne; Livingston Manor is host to the Dai Bosatsu Zendo; a colony of Hare Krishna is at Lake Huntington; the Reunification Church, under the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, has bought land in Accord, and other groups range from the Emissaries of the Divine Light to the Shalom Retreat Center. ''The new cult groups are quite a contrast with the old resorts,'' said Andrew Neiderman of South Fallsburg, who has written novels and histories of the Catskills. ''The fluxing that is going on here is exciting - to see Orthodox Jews talking to guys in togas.'' He added that the religious immigration had also led to the removal of 1 million in property from the tax rolls. More low-income families have settled in the region, and Mr. Neiderman, who teaches English in high school, said he had seen a decline in students' ambitions and the quality of education. But the most noteworthy recent change, he said, is the arrival of painters, sculptors, musicians and other artists fleeing the sharp increase in the price of studio space in New York City. One group of Manhattan and Brooklyn artists has virtually taken over Mountain Dale, a Sullivan County hamlet that was once a stop on the old New York, Ontario and Western Railroad that brought in vacationers before World War II. ''I drove into Mountain Dale one day in 1975 trying to buy a pack of cigarettes,'' said Bob Lew, a 29-year-old sculptor from Brooklyn. ''It was a ghost town - the dogs sleeping on the main street wouldn't even budge.'' Bought Church for 7,500 Mr. Lew bought the Mountain Dale Methodist Church and its two acres for 7,500, then turned it into a studio; he plans to make it a foundry for casting. He and Gregg Bennett, 28, a Monticello musician, then bought the town's main building, once a candy store and luncheonette, for 14,500, and turned it into a restaurant and saloon. In the last few years, artists and designers have moved in, bought old buildings and rehabilitated them through grants averaging 3,500. More than 1 million is being invested in new water and sewer lines and storm drains, and the once-dead hamlet has been officially designated as the model community of Sullivan County. The outlook for other towns in the Catskills, such as Ellenville, Monticello and Liberty, is less optimistic. Crime Rate Climbing To Larry Barnes, the Liberty police chief, the changes are not necessarily for the better. ''When I started on the force here 10 years ago, we dealt with 300 criminal cases a year,'' he said. ''The number last year was 800, and the rate is continuing to rise.'' He attributed the problem to unemployment and the movement of lowincome people from other areas. An increase in the Spanish-speaking population - and ensuing difficulties in communication - are another indication that the ethnic mix of the Catskills is changing. Resorts such as the Villa Roma, the Bel Fior Hotel and Lanza's Hotel now operate alongside the more traditional inns and, like the older ones, they badly want legalized casino gambling. Mark Grossinger Etess, vice president and general manager of Grossinger's, said that 1980 was the best year in recent times, a view echoed by his competitors. He and Charles Slutsky of the Fallsview resort are leading lobbying efforts to have gambling legalized, and both men view the Atlantic City casinos as the biggest threat to their livelihood since the European vacation boom of the 1960's. ''We need gambling to stay competitive,'' Mr. Etess said. He added that he foresaw tremendous competition within five years, when Atlantic City builds many more hotel rooms ''and gets its social act together.''

But perhaps the vanquished United States soccer team can rest in the knowledge that if the World Cup was decided on guts, it would surely be lifting the trophy in Brazil. For 120 minutes of Tuesday's ultimately unsuccessful last-16 clash with Belgium, each one of Jurgen Klinsmann's men left everything on the field in Salvador. From the second the Americans went 2-0 down in extra time thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, the rearguard action started. Substitute Julian Green's goal offered the nation a lifeline and energized its fatigued players with a quarter of an hour to play. The pattern continued after the interval, the USA adopting a more open style than in its previous encounter but at the same time struggling to counter the pace and dynamism offered by OPTIONS: - Americans. - Argentina. - Belgium. - Brazil. - CNN. - Julian Green. - Jurgen Klinsmann. - Kevin De Bruyne. - Romelu Lukaku. - Salvador. - USA. - United States. - World Cup.","completion":"the Belgium side. The relentless Belgian offense, spearheaded by the electrifying duo of Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, threatened to break through the gritty American defense time and time again, while the USA frantically searched for opportunities to exploit on the counter. Jurgen Klinsmann's strategic adjustments during the course of the game showed his tactical acumen and adaptability, but still, the United States seemed to be hanging by a thread in the face of the formidable Belgian opposition. However, the indomitable spirit of the Americans, summed up by Julian Green's crucial goal, ensured that they fought on with every last ounce of energy they could muster. The team's determination provided a clear testament to the never-say-die attitude that the United States soccer team has increasingly become known for on the international stage. As the final whistle blew, the exhausted American players could hold their heads high, having given their all in a hard-fought battle against a strong Belgian side. Despite their elimination, they had won the hearts and respect of soccer fans across the globe, proving that a team that possesses immense courage, determination, and resilience can still make its mark on the world stage. While the United States may not be taking home the World Cup trophy from Brazil, in the annals of the tournament's history, their spirited performance will forever be remembered. And as American soccer continues to grow and develop, players and coaches will undoubtedly draw inspiration from this exceptional display of heart and fortitude that was, in its own way, a moral victory for the team and the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Nineteenth-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir Walter Scott's historical romance, Ivanhoe, which presented \\"an almost totally unfavourable picture\\" of the king; the work drew on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play. Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black-and-white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an \\"effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home\\". The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the \\"swashbuckling villain\\" opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a \\"cowardly, thumbsucking lion\\". Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, commonly present him as an \\"effete weakling\\", in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II, or as a tyrant, as in A. A. Milne's poem for children, \\"King John's Christmas\\".

Context: This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. ‚ÄúIf you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,‚Äù Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, ‚ÄúBuild the wall!‚Äù Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. ‚ÄúWe are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,‚Äù he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. ‚ÄúWe should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,‚Äù said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. ‚ÄúWhat country is that? This is the United States of America!‚Äù Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olh√£o. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk ‚Äî armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones ‚Äî attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olh√£o all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Pa√ßo, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

Here's a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Add 167*v on both sides of the equation to move the -167*v term to the left side. -178*v + 167*v = -167*v + 167*v - 33 Which simplifies to: -11*v = -33 Step 2: Now we want to solve for v. To find the value of v, we are going to divide both sides of the equation by -11.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"man jogging on a road, in front of a big unfinished building.\\", does this mean that \\"The man is sitting down.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"man jogging on a road, in front of a big unfinished building\\" does not mean that \\"The man is sitting down.\\" These two statements actually describe two completely different actions and scenarios. In the first statement, it explains that the man is jogging, which is a form of exercise that involves running at a leisurely pace. This action requires the person to be in motion, stretching and contracting their muscles in a rhythmic manner while propelling themselves forward. Jogging is an activity that elevates the heart rate and requires continuous physical effort. This scenario also provides details about the man's surroundings, specifying that he is on a road and in front of a big unfinished building. The road indicates that he is in an outdoor setting, and the unfinished building adds context to the environment he is in, suggesting that it could be a construction site, a developing urban area, or a location undergoing renovation. On the other hand, the statement \\"The man is sitting down\\" describes a completely different action where the man is not physically active like in the jogging scenario. Sitting down entails supporting one's body weight with their buttocks and possibly their back, while the legs are bent at the knees and the feet are resting on the ground or another surface. This position implies that someone is in a resting state, with little to no physical movement involved. When a person sits down, it generally means they are taking a break, relaxing, or engaged in a sedentary activity such as reading, writing, or watching something. To summarize, the initial scenario presents the man as being engaged in a physical activity, jogging on a road in front of a big unfinished building. This does not imply or have any connection to the second statement, which describes the man as sitting down in a stationary position. These two statements depict different actions and situations that are not related or interchangeable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hu Peng of Wuhan and four friends decided to find them out. Earlier this month, they lived for a week in Caidian, a village near Wuhan. Hu and his friends went door to door in Caidian and asked the kids there lots of questions. They wanted to learn more about village kids' everyday lives, so they asked these questions like --Do your parents teach you how to do housework? How much money do you usually spend on dinner? What would you do if a thief came into your house? They also asked 150 city kids the same questions.What's the Difference? Last week the team gave a report to their class. There are lots of differences between children's lives in cities and those in villages. The biggest difference is independence. Hu's team said that 60 percent of city kids couldn't do much housework, but 90 percent of village kids could care for themselves. City kids told Hu they cared about school a lot, and they had no time for washing clothes or making their beds. Village kids said they helped their parents with housework a lot. They cooked, did some cleaning and fed animals. Hu's team also found that village kids had less pocket money . Many never used computers. They played in rivers or on mountains. Some didn't really like to make new friends. Hu and his friends said their trip gave them more self-confidence because they were doing something by themselves. But _ also made them a little worried because they saw they still had a lot to learn. \\"When we grow up, our parents can't take care of us,\\" said Hu. \\"We have to learn to take care of ourselves.\\" Shen Guanquan, one of Hu's friends said, \\"When children learn to care for themselves, they learn to do lots of things.\\" Question: From the article, the biggest difference is _ between city kids and village kids.

In early June, Spain‚Äôs lower house of parliament approved a law paving a pathway to citizenship for descendants of Jews who were forced to leave the country during the inquisition.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the two suites Holst wrote for military band?, using the article: Holst's settings of Indian texts formed only a part of his compositional output in the period 1900 to 1914. A highly significant factor in his musical development was the English folksong revival, evident in the orchestral suite A Somerset Rhapsody (1906‚Äì07), a work that was originally to be based around eleven folksong themes; this was later reduced to four. Observing the work's kinship with Vaughan Williams's Norfolk Rhapsody, Dickinson remarks that, with its firm overall structure, Holst's composition \\"rises beyond the level of ... a song-selection\\". Imogen acknowledges that Holst's discovery of English folksongs \\"transformed his orchestral writing\\", and that the composition of A Somerset Rhapsody did much to banish the chromaticisms that had dominated his early compositions. In the Two Songs without Words of 1906, Holst showed that he could create his own original music using the folk idiom. An orchestral folksong fantasy Songs of the West, also written in 1906, was withdrawn by the composer and never published, although it emerged in the 1980s in the form of an arrangement for wind band by James Curnow. In the years before the First World War, Holst composed in a variety of genres. Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the Beni Mora suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of minimalism in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in E flat (1909) and F major (1911) respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple. This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \\"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\\". Also in 1911 he wrote Hecuba's Lament, a setting of Gilbert Murray's translation from Euripides built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent Hecuba's defiance of divine wrath. In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which..., what would be the answer ?

The site advertises it will be smoked all night in their famous sauce. 4) cole slaw that was room temp, that was way to vinegar based to have mayo. The bbq was so fatty it was from a horrible cut.

Summarize: A report into the attack on the Heights Bar in Loughinisland by the ombudsman last week said the killers had been protected from investigation. But Michael Maguire did not use powers to have any officers involved arrested. He also did not send files to the Public Prosecution Service. The ombudsman has said there was insufficient evidence to support criminal charges. Families of the victims of the Loughinisland attack said they had been vindicated by the report's findings, and called for all of those involved to be brought to justice. It is the responsibility of the police ombudsman to investigate alleged criminal behaviour by current and former police officers. His investigators also have the power to arrest suspects, and can recommend that they face charges. Mr Maguire was highly critical of some of former members of RUC Special Branch. He said police informers involved in the Loughinisland attack, and the importation of a huge consignment of weapons from South Africa, had been protected. \\"Some police officers appeared to place more value on gathering information and protecting their sources than on the prevention and detection of crime,\\" he said. But he did not have any of the former officers arrested, and did not recommend to the Public Prosecution Service that they should face charges. In an interview for Tuesday night's BBC Spotlight programme, the chief constable has expressed surprise. \\"There does seem to be some sort of distance between the strength of the language in the report, in the fact that we're not having police officers even reported to the PPS,\\" he said. \\"If I got to a point where I was convinced in a very clear way that collusion was a key element of the Loughinisland murders then I'd be looking to take that conclusion into evidence through arrests, interviews, charges.\\" A former police ombudsman, Nuala O'Loan, told Spotlight that bringing charges would be extremely difficult because of the relationship between police informants and their handlers. \\"The problem that you have when you do these investigations as a police ombudsman is that the paramilitaries with whom the police officers were colluding are the witnesses for the police ombudsman, and the police officers whom the police ombudsman is investigating are the witnesses for the police investigating the paramilitaries,\\" she said. The current ombudsman has said that while there was sufficient evidence for him to say some police officers had been involved in collusion, there was not enough evidence to support criminal charges. In a statement to the BBC, Michael Maguire said that as a result of the passage of time some witnesses were no longer available, some documentation was missing and it was not always possible to get a detailed picture of the role of certain individuals. He said a number of related issues referred to in the Loughinisland report are still under investigation. Spotlight will be on BBC One Northern Ireland at 22:45 BST on Tuesday 14 June. Summary:","completion":"A man named Michael Maguire looked into a bad thing that happened in a place called Loughinisland. He said that some people who did bad things were protected and not punished. Even though he found some not-so-good things about how the police worked, he decided that there wasn't enough proof to say that someone should be in trouble. Some people are upset and want all the people involved to face justice. Michael Maguire explained that because of how long ago this happened, it's hard to find enough proof to say that someone should be in trouble."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect were horrible, I hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself? Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least. What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army staff looks unconvincing. To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours. Now, what is this review like?

To provide further context and elaborate on this, let's break down the original sentence and analyze the details given: 1. Two people are cuddling: This statement suggests that the two individuals are engaged in an intimate or affectionate gesture that typically involves holding each other closely. 2. While overlooking a harbor: The action of overlooking a harbor signifies that the people are positioned in a location where they have a vantage point to view the harbor scene. Harbors are outdoor entities where water meets the land, typically used for mooring and sheltering boats and ships. 3. With mountains in the distance: The presence of mountains in the distance further indicates that the people are in an outdoor setting, as mountains are natural landforms rising prominently above their surroundings, and this detail suggests that the location offers a broader scenic view. Given these components of the original sentence, it is apparent that the two people are indeed outdoors. They are engaging in a close embrace while they have a vantage point from where they can see the harbor and the mountains, all of which are outdoor elements.

Jacob manages to banish Lubdan the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after dies of injuries inflicted by the leprechaun during the fight. One year later, two friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson), have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil.

Of course, the most unforgettable classmate I had was also the most vicious bully. I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone‚Äôs face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn‚Äôt care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn‚Äôt cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn‚Äôt work out why.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Single-Study Syndrome and the G.M.O. Food Fight [This is a modified, expanded version of my Tumblr post from yesterday. I was on the run between Arctic ice symposium and teaching duties; more on ice anon.] 11:31 a.m. | Updated below as marked | I‚Äôve written here before about what I call ‚Äúsingle-study syndrome,‚Äù the habit of the more aggressive camps of advocates surrounding hot issues (e.g., climate, chemical exposure, fracking) to latch onto and push studies supporting an agenda, no matter how tenuous ‚Äî or dubious ‚Äî the research might be. Here‚Äôs a fresh example from the food wars, which are particularly heated right now because of California‚Äôs looming vote over Proposition 37, which would require labeling of genetically modified foods: Groups opposed to genetically modified crops or ‚ÄúBig Ag‚Äú are heavily promoting a new study claiming to find big impacts on longevity and cancer rates in rats fed Roundup-ready corn (and separately exposed to the herbicide for which the corn variety is named). Andrew Pollack‚Äôs news article on the study describes the methods and findings. The study has been quickly and widely criticized, even as it has been written on far and wide. One issue is that, while the experiments ran for two years, far longer than most rat studies of food safety, the chosen rat breed commonly develops tumors after two years. Combined with small sample size (the different test groups had 20 animals each), this has led even some advocates for G.M.O. labeling to question the results. The food researcher and writer Marion Nestle, a supporter of labeling, called the study ‚Äúweirdly complicated‚Äù in an excellent look at the work posted yesterday by Tim Carman of the Washington Post. In Rosie Mestel‚Äôs Los Angeles Times article, another scientist said the combination of a tumor-prone rat breed and small sample size created big problems: Another red flag was that tumor rates didn‚Äôt increase in line with the dose of GMOs fed to animals, as scientists would expect to see if the genetically engineered corn were to blame, said Kevin Folta, a plant molecular biologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Instead, ‚Äúyou are likely seeing variation of normal tumor incidence in a small population of rats,‚Äù he said. Please read the pieces by Carman and Mestel end to end if you have time. For more background on the California ballot tussle, read Stephanie Strom‚Äôs recent feature and video report. Here‚Äôs my view. As I wrote in considering ‚Äúpink slime:‚Äù I‚Äôm all for open disclosure of food contents, but not when the labeling effort is aimed at fomenting fear over facts. (This issue goes far beyond beef byproducts; I encourage you to read this Colorado State University analysis ofthe issues surrounding labeling of genetically engineered foods.) While I‚Äôm for transparency, I don‚Äôt like the California initiative because it‚Äôs rife with exemptions and special cases, all of which speak of a double standard and point to the intent being less to protect public health than make life complicated or costlier for some agriculture sectors. If a fair labeling process were somehow created, I actually think it‚Äôd build public support for genetically modified foods in the long haul, primarily by illustrating how many safe, nutritious foods now unremarkably contain some constituent from this form of agricultural technology. I‚Äôll set up a separate post to vet the prime arguments on all sides. My colleague Mark Bittman has a different view, laid out in ‚ÄúG.M.O.‚Äôs: Let‚Äôs Label ‚ÄòEm.‚Äù For more on the debate over risks from Roundup-ready corn and the herbicide Roundup, read evolutionary geneticist* Michael Eisen‚Äôs June blog post: ‚Äú#GMOFAQ How Bt corn and Roundup Ready soy work, and why they should not scare you.‚Äù [11:31 a.m. | Updated | Professor Eisen, who‚Äôs at the University of California, Berkeley, sent this reaction to my post: It‚Äôs a really messed up field. The vast majority of research on GMO safety ‚Äì on both sides ‚Äì is done by people out to prove something rather than investigate something. This affects every aspect of the work, from study design, to execution, interpretation and publicity. This particular study was so poorly designed ‚Äì the highly sensitized line, the inexcusably small number of animals ‚Äì that you didn‚Äôt even have to look at the ridiculous statements from the lead author (like ‚ÄúGMOs are a pesticide sponge‚Äù) to see that it was biased. The result of all of this severely tainted work (and there‚Äôs plenty from the pro-GMO side too) is that the really good science in the field gets drowned out, and isn‚Äôt taken seriously because people just assume that it, too, must be biased. Total mess. For a broader view of the literature on health studies focused on genetically modified foods, read this review paper from 2011: ‚ÄùAssessment of the health impact of GM plant diets in long-term and multigenerational animal feeding trials: A literature review.‚Äù The aim of this systematic review was to collect data concerning the effects of diets containing GM maize, potato, soybean, rice, or triticale on animal health. We examined 12 long-term studies (of more than 90 days, up to 2 years in duration) and 12 multigenerational studies (from 2 to 5 generations). We referenced the 90-day studies on GM feed for which long-term or multigenerational study data were available. Many parameters have been examined using biochemical analyses, histological examination of specific organs, hematology and the detection of transgenic DNA. The statistical findings and methods have been considered from each study. Results from all the 24 studies do not suggest any health hazards and, in general, there were no statistically significant differences within parameters observed. However, some small differences were observed, though these fell within the normal variation range of the considered parameter and thus had no biological or toxicological significance. If required, a 90-day feeding study performed in rodents, according to the OECD Test Guideline, is generally considered sufficient in order to evaluate the health effects of GM feed. The studies reviewed present evidence to show that GM plants are nutritionally equivalent to their non-GM counterparts and can be safely used in food and feed. Addendum: When research cuts against an agenda, other issues arise. A ridiculous petition has been initiated aimed at forcing the retraction of a paper by Stanford University scientists on the relative nutritional merits of organic and conventional foods. Rosie Mestel, a vital guide on such issues, did a valuable piece that essentiallydismantles the assertions of the activists pushing the petition. I agree with Paul Raeburn, writing on Knight Science Journalism tracker, who hailed the story for charting ‚Äúa clear path for us through a nasty thicket.‚Äù 11:34 a.m. | Clarification | * I posted a clarification of Eisin‚Äôs specialty here a few hours after the piece ran, but it turns out it was pretty much correct originally.","completion":"The article discusses a controversial study about the impact of genetically modified (GMO) foods on health, particularly targeting Roundup-ready corn, a variety of corn genetically modified to withstand the herbicide glyphosate. The study was heavily promoted by groups opposing GMO crops, as it claimed significant impacts on longevity and cancer rates in rats that were fed this kind of corn. However, the research was widely criticized for limiting its scope to a breed of rat that commonly develops tumors after two years, coupled with a small sample size, therefore, the test groups each consisted of only 20 animals. Even supporters of GMO labeling expressed doubts about the study's results, calling it \\"weirdly complicated.\\" Another point of concern was that tumor rates did not increase proportionally with the dose of GMOs fed to the animals, contradicting scientific expectations if the genetically engineered corn were indeed to blame. Given these criticisms, the credibility of the study was called into question. The article also talks about the debate over Proposition 37 in California, which proposed labeling of genetically modified foods. The author stated their view on this matter, expressing support for open disclosure of food contents. However, they argued against the California initiative as it was filled with exemptions and special situations, suggesting its main aim was not public health but complicating or making things more expensive for certain agricultural sectors. Their preferred approach was to establish a fair labeling process which would ultimately build public support for GMO foods by highlighting their safe and nutrient-rich constituents. Lastly, the article mentions Professor Michael Eisen's view on GMO research, stating that many studies on GMO safety were biased as researchers were more interested in proving something rather than investigating. This bias affects all aspects of the work, from study design to execution, interpretation, and publicity. He added that such poor studies detract from the high-quality research in the field."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Trivia question: What is the name for a group of witches? And the answer is?","completion":"The name for a group of witches is called a \\"coven.\\" A coven is typically comprised of multiple witches who come together for various reasons, such as to perform rituals, practice witchcraft, and engage in spiritual activities. The term has its roots in ancient traditions and beliefs and is also present in contemporary witchcraft practices. Historically, a coven's membership could range in number from three to thirteen, though this could vary from one group to another. Sometimes membership may be limited because of the belief that too many witches could dilute the group's power or complicate the decision-making process. Covens are known to be strongly community-oriented, with members supporting, guiding, and nurturing one another on their spiritual journeys. The notion of a coven became famous during the witch trials that took place from the late 15th to the late 18th century in Europe and North America. The prosecution accused witches of gathering in covens to worship the devil and perform dark magic. It is important to note that many of the witch trials were fueled by paranoia and superstition, resulting in the execution of innocent individuals. Nevertheless, the modern depiction of covens has seen a dramatic transformation. They are now largely associated with the practice of contemporary witchcraft, also known as Wicca, where they adopt a more positive and sympathetic portrayal. In Wicca, covens usually operate as democratic collectives, with members working together to refine their magical skills and contribute to each other's personal growth. Covens often practice magical work, such as casting spells, healing, creating sacred space, and celebrating important events like the full moon and the changing seasons. These gatherings are known as Esbats and Sabbats, respectively. Some covens are more eclectic in nature, adhering to various spiritual beliefs and practices, while others follow more specific Wiccan traditions, such as Gardnerian, Dianic, or Alexandrian. Today, a coven is viewed as a safe, supportive, and inclusive space for witches to explore and grow in their magical practices. These groups prioritize empowering their members and celebrating the diverse range of beliefs, experiences, and identities that they bring to the group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The referendum is over but the debate over the future of UK politics is just beginning. Ben Wright reports Scotland has voted \\"No\\" to independence in the historic referendum on the nation's future. For now, that means it will continue to form an integral part of the UK - but for Scottish devolution, the process of granting powers from Westminster to the Scottish parliament, it's far from business as usual. The focus will now be on how the UK government delivers its promise of more powers for the Scottish parliament, based at Holyrood, Edinburgh. Here's what's likely to happen next. More power The three biggest UK-wide political parties - The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats - agree that further devolution of powers to Holyrood must take place. During the referendum campaign, the parties signed a pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland, if Scots rejected independence. A timetable to deliver change was set out by former prime minister - and Scottish MP - Gordon Brown. It was quickly endorsed by the UK-wide parties. Immediately after the result became clear, Prime Minister David Cameron aimed to show the UK government was grabbing the initiative by announcing Lord Smith of Kelvin, a former BBC governor, to oversee the implementation of more devolution on tax, spending and welfare. He said draft legislation would be ready by January, as per the timetable laid out by Brown. Under the former PM's proposals, a \\"command paper\\" would be published by the present UK government setting out all the proposals by the end of October. A white paper would be drawn up by the end of November, after a period of consultation, setting out the proposed powers. A draft new \\"Scotland Act\\" law would be published by Burns Night (25 January) 2015 ready for the House of Commons to vote on. However, with a UK general election due in May 2015, the legislation would not be passed until the new parliament began. Party differences The Scottish Parliament is currently funded through a block grant and the amount it gets is defined by the Barnett Formula - an arrangement for adjusting funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to spend on devolved policy areas, on the basis of population . All three parties are committed to preserving the essence of this mechanism in some form. And in proposals set out by the parties earlier this year, each offered Holyrood considerably more income tax-raising powers than the Scottish parliament has at present. However, there were significant differences between the parties in the proposed extent of those changes. What the 'No' vote means for Scotland and rest of the UK Labour wants to give Holyrood the power to vary income tax by 15p in the pound - but not the power to cut the top tax rate on its own. The Conservatives propose to give Scotland total control over income tax rates and bands. Holyrood would also be accountable for 40% of the money it spent. The Liberal Democrats propose giving Scotland power over income tax, inheritance and capital gains tax. The party has also touted scrapping the Act of Union between Scotland and England and replacing it with a declaration of federalism. None of this will suffice for the Scottish National Party, but just as the Edinburgh Agreement, committed Prime Minister David Cameron to honouring the referendum result, the same is true for the Scottish first minister. The Scottish government is expected to fight for a \\"devo max\\" - essentially far-reaching devolution - package of powers, likely to include total control over income tax, corporation tax, and air passenger duty, and extensive control over welfare. The negotiations UK political parties will have to work through their differences, and come up with a single proposal. But others will also be involved. In the lead up to the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the UK government laid out its devolved responsibilities in a White Paper in July 1997, before they were backed by voters and put into legislation. Credit for paving the road towards Scottish devolution was given to the Scottish Constitutional Convention, an association of Scottish political parties, churches and other civic groups set up in 1989. Lord Smith's new body on finalising Holyrood's new powers could in some ways be seen as a modern-day version of the organisation. SNP future Image copyright AFP Image caption Nicola Sturgeon could be in the running to take over from Alex Salmond So what now for the SNP? In the immediate future, it's back to government - the job to which the SNP was elected by a landslide at the last Scottish Parliament election. But, following the \\"No\\" vote, Mr Salmond announced he would step down as SNP leader and first minister at the SNP's annual conference in November. There will now be an SNP leadership contest - these are known for being interesting - with Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon the clear frontrunner. But might we see former leadership challengers Mike Russell, Alex Neil and Roseanna Cunningham - all now members of the Scottish government - also throw their hats in the ring? John Swinney though, Scotland's finance secretary, has ruled out a return to the leadership, a job he held between 2000 and 2004. And, for a party which hasn't always had the most harmonious existence, the SNP's shown a remarkable level of discipline since winning office in 2007 - but could that now be in jeopardy? However, given the scale of the SNP's last election victory, it is quite possible the party will win the next Scottish parliament election, especially if voters feel Labour has not done enough to win back their trust as a party of government. Rest of the UK With increased devolution of powers to Holyrood, many will want to address the so-called West Lothian question: is it fair that English MPs have no say on devolved issues in Scotland, but Scottish MPs at Westminster can still vote on the same issues as they affect England? A recent poll by YouGov for the Herald suggested 62% of English people believe Scottish MPs should be banned from voting on England-only laws. Many in Wales and Northern Ireland will also ask whether they should be getting more powers too. The other issue for Wales is the continuation of the Barnett funding formula, which sees Scotland get more spending per head than the UK average. Plaid Cymru says the arrangement would leave Wales ¬£300m poorer each year, while Labour has promised to address the issue if it wins the 2015 UK election. ||||| Story highlights Scotland votes \\"no\\" in referendum about whether to leave the United Kingdom Final polls showed a narrow race after years of campaigning on either side Failure of \\"yes\\" vote saves UK Prime Minister from humiliating defeat Oakley: Cameron will breathe a sigh of relief at a partial reprieve David Cameron has had the narrowest of political escapes. Success for the \\"Better Together\\" campaign has saved him from catastrophe: he will not, after all, live on in history as the Prime Minister on whose watch the Scottish nation chose to leave the United Kingdom. But serious questions will now be asked in his party and in the country about his future. Cameron will also face an almighty battle in Parliament to deliver the consolation prize of greatly enhanced powers for the Scottish Parliament, the so-called \\"Devo Max\\" package, which he was forced to concede in the panicky latter stages of the No campaign. On Friday morning, the tired but relieved-looking Premier told reporters at 10 Downing Street that it would have broken his heart to see Scotland leave the UK. \\"The people of Scotland have spoken,\\" Cameron said. \\"They have kept our country of four nations together, and like millions of other people, I am delighted.\\" Cameron called on the country to move forward with a \\"balanced settlement, fair to the people of Scotland -- and importantly, to everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.\\" JUST WATCHED Cameron 'delighted' with Scotland vote Replay More Videos ...

READ: Scotland decides: The final count Did Gordon Brown save it? Cameron and his party were not the only ones to blame for a referendum campaign that so nearly led to the break-up of the United Kingdom. But he is being widely blamed for a variety of tactical and strategic errors. Many members of Parliament (MPs) will say that he and the \\"Better Together\\" campaign were only rescued by the campaigning fervor and passion of the former Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Cameron had sought to detach the questions of Scottish independence and his own future. Warning the Scots that what they were walking into was not a trial separation but a final break, he pleaded with them not to throw away the union in a protest vote just because they disliked him and his party. (Of the 59 Scottish seats in the Westminster Parliament only one is held by a Conservative MP). QUIZ: How Scottish are you? Insisting on the finality of a constitutional divorce was probably his best card. But in emphasizing that the question on the ballot paper was not his future but the future of the union, Cameron was also acknowledging that he is held to blame by many for boosting the nationalist vote. Where Cameron went wrong He is blamed firstly for the terms he agreed on the staging of the referendum. Critics lambast Cameron now for giving Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond two years to build momentum for his cause, and for opening the vote to 16 year olds. They blame him for agreeing to a ballot paper question which meant that the supporters of independence were the ones campaigning for a \\"Yes\\" while their opponents were bound to look negative in seeking a \\"No.\\" They blame him for agreeing to let one vote decide the issue: when a Labour government in the 1970s agreed to a referendum on setting up a Scottish Parliament it insisted that 40% of those voting must approve the change. There was a majority for the Parliament but the 40% margin was not achieved and the Scots had to wait another 20 years for their own Parliament. Above all, the critics insist Cameron was wrong to exclude from the ballot paper the compromise option of the so-called \\"Devo Max\\" ‚Äî a huge extension in the tax-raising and spending powers of the Scottish Parliament. This devolution of power from London to Edinburgh appealed to many as an achievable compromise which would have taken the steam out of the separatist case. But Cameron overruled such advice, only to find that he and the other Westminster party leaders were forced to concede Devo Max anyway ‚Äî win or lose the vote ‚Äî as the campaign threatened to run away from them. Even during the lead-up to the vote, when many Conservative MPs kept quiet for fear of making things worse for the Better Together campaign, some were warning that the concessions on Devo Max wrung from Cameron by Gordon Brown might not be deliverable. What comes next? Conservative MPs are already vociferously demanding that any concessions to the Scottish Parliament must be balanced by greater powers for the English regions -- namely, by reducing the number of Scottish MPs in the Westminster Parliament and by ending the process whereby Scottish MPs at Westminster can vote on English-only matters while English MPs have no say in matters delegated to the Scottish Parliament. As a moderate and pragmatic politician, Cameron has had an uneasy tenure already over a right-leaning party growing ever more Euro-skeptic as it faces the rise of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). The further difficulties he will face in pushing through legislation to honor his commitments to the Scots will do nothing to add to his authority. But Cameron will breathe a sigh of relief at a partial reprieve: had he seen the Scots depart from the UK he might well have faced a rebellion in his party which could have gone as far as the tabling of a vote of no confidence in his leadership -- a process which requires 15% of his MPs (46 of them) to sign up to the proposition. For the moment at least he soldiers on. But there is further trouble looming. Opinion polls indicate that next month his party will lose its first Parliament seat to UKIP in a by-election caused by the defection of former Tory MP Douglas Carswell. READ: 5 inspired secessionist movements ||||| Hurrah - Scotland has voted No. The United Kingdom will remain intact, backed by a wide margin of around 55-45pc against independence. Here are seven ways in which the Scotland vote will impact investors, business and the economy. 1. Sterling has already bounced back, recouping all of the losses since the one poll a few weeks ago that showed a slim lead for the Yes vote. The wobble has already been forgotten. The stock market - the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 -- has bounced this morning. It is even possible that the FTSE 100 breaks its all time high last reached at the end of 1999. Beware, though: by the end of yesterday, the markets had priced in an easy win for the No camp, which means that market reaction won‚Äôt be as violent as it could otherwise have been. Crucially, investors will also pile into gilts, which will push up their prices and lower their yields. 2. The government has been saved, at least for now; the immediate constitutional crisis has been avoided. But investors and markets will now start to think about the May 2015 General Election in earnest, and focus on the fact that all of the polls show that Labour is on course for victory. But the massive change announced by David Cameron this morning is that he also wants the English and others to be given the same powers as Scotland - ie English votes for English laws. Left-wing Scottish MPs will no longer be able to decide on English matters, just in the same way that English MPs can no longer decide on Scottish matters. This is a constitutional revolution - and it means that even a Labour takeover of the House of Commons could still mean Tories in charge in England, preventing some of the worst UK-wide anti-business excesses. The devil will be in the detail, however. 3. In the long-run, the chances of a Brexit - a UK exit from the EU - are now higher than they were, though not as high as if Scotland had voted Yes. It is clear that campaigners can make huge headway even if the establishment is against them. Expect the Out campaign to use a similar strategy to that embraced by Salmond - though with actual facts and genuine arguments this time, rather than bluff, bluster and denial. 4. What will happen now to Scottish financial institutions and others that had made provisions to shift their headquarters south of the border in the event of a Yes? Of course, they won‚Äôt now relocate - but their confidence in Scotland has undoubtedly been badly, if not irreparably damaged. Alex Salmond said that the matter is settled ‚Äúfor now‚Äù - in other words, not for ever. Even if tax and spend policy doesn‚Äôt now change in Scotland, we can expect to see far less foreign direct investment and a slow migration of good jobs to England. 5. In practice, of course, everything will now change. Scotland will have far greater powers - and it is likely to use them to impose social-democratic policies, which will make Scotland less competitive. Meanwhile, an English parliament could do the opposite. Arguably, therefore, the City of London could become more competitive as a result of this vote and the accompanying, as yet unpredictable constitutional revolution that is unfolding. But Labour and the Lib Dems could still manage to sabotage English devolution. It‚Äôs a key question. 6. Betting markets are very good predictors of electoral outcomes. They very rarely, if ever, get it wrong; the weight of money is far more powerful a barometer of public opinion than the analysis of many specialist pundits. The wisdom of the crowd - at least the cash-rich, lets put our money where our mouth is variety -- does work. Polls are also much more precise than they used to be - their average tends to be right within 2-3 points and get the direction right. 7. Over all, the UK economy won‚Äôt be affected noticeably in the short-term: at worst, uncertainty will have shaved a tiny bit of one quarter‚Äôs GDP, all of which will be recouped. The big effect will come from the long-term tax, spending and governance impact of a wholesale, UK-wide constitutional revolution. ||||| Image copyright PA Image caption Lord Smith of Kelvin was involved Glasgow's Commonwealth Games Lord Smith of Kelvin was appointed to oversee the process of devolving more powers to Scotland. But who is he? Robert Haldane Smith was born in 1944 in Glasgow - Scotland's biggest city to vote \\"Yes\\" in the Scottish independence referendum. When his home city was selected to host the Commonwealth Games, the Scottish government asked him to be chairman of the organising company. First Minister Alex Salmond said at the time that Lord Smith had a \\"proven track record\\" and \\"tremendous\\" experience. He attended the all-boys Allan Glen's School in Glasgow and after leaving education he entered accountancy, qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1968. Lord Smith worked at the Royal Bank of Scotland and held senior positions at Charterhouse Development Capital; Morgan Grenfell Private Equity and Deutsche Asset Management. For more than a decade he was chairman of global engineering company the Weir Group until stepping down in 2013. The businessman has also held numerous non-executive directorships at MFI, Stakis and Network Rail. He also chairs energy giant SSE. Two years ago he made the headlines when he was appointed the first chairman of the UK's Green Investment Bank, based in Edinburgh. In 1999, Lord Smith was knighted and then in 2008 he was given a peerage, becoming an independent cross-bencher in the House of Lords.

Lord Smith is also a former BBC governor, head of the Broadcasting Council for Scotland and chairman of the BBC's Children in Need. In 2003, he was invested as chancellor of Paisley University, which became the University of the West of Scotland, and held the role until September last year. He was installed as chancellor of the University of Strathclyde in October 2013. The 70-year-old is married with two daughters. Lord Smith owns Inchmarnock, a small uninhabited island off the west coast of Scotland where he breeds Highland cattle. He bought it in March 1999 and partnered with Headland Archaeology to carry out a seven-year investigation into the island, covering pre-history, early Christian, medieval and modern times. At the end of the process, Lord Smith said: \\"The discoveries have exceeded all my expectations, as has the quality of this scholarly work. \\"I have learned a very great deal about the history of Inchmarnock, and grown to love it and respect it and its former inhabitants even more, if that is possible.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Scotland has voted \\"No\\" to independence in the historic referendum, which means it will continue to form an integral part of the UK.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: COLUMBIA ‚Äî Thousands of mourners on Wednesday streamed past the open casket of Clementa Pinckney, the esteemed pastor and state senator who lay in state under the Capitol dome a week after he and eight others were slain at a historic black Charleston church. Pinckney‚Äôs widow, Jennifer, two young daughters, Eliana and Malana, other family members and lawmakers he served with during nearly two decades in the Legislature stood by the casket greeting those paying their respects. Portraits of Pinckney, who was dressed in a black suit and red tie, stood on either side of the casket. Pinckney made his final journey to the Statehouse by horse-drawn caisson as lawmakers lined up along the top of the Capitol steps to watch the slow approach on Main Street from Leevy‚Äôs Funeral Home. The procession followed a paved path around the west side of the Statehouse grounds. Gov. Nikki Haley watched as nine state troopers in wide-brimmed hats hoisted the casket and carried Pinckney into the Capitol as the crowd outside sang ‚ÄúWe Shall Overcome.‚Äù Pinckney, pastor of Emanuel AME Church, and other ministers and parishioners attending evening Bible study June 17 at his church died in a mass shooting. The nine were killed in a hail of gunfire by a 21-year-old avowed white supremacist who wanted to kill blacks and start a race war, authorities said. President Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy at Pinckney‚Äôs funeral in Charleston on Friday and plans to meet with the families of the nine victims, according to a source close to those planning the services. As Pinckney‚Äôs casket disappeared inside the Statehouse, mourners, including Edna Nesbit of Hollywood, called out, ‚ÄúGod bless you.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe were just so heartbroken that we had to come here,‚Äù Nesbit, 67, said later. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just so nice to see the respect given to a man who died too early and for no reason ‚Äî just racism.‚Äù For two hours before the Capitol opened to mourners, people formed a line that would snake from a side entrance, around the building and down Sumter Street. One of them was Queen Palmer, 62, of Columbia, who had followed the procession. ‚ÄúWhat happened was sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut this is good because everyone is coming together ‚Äî both black and white. They‚Äôre coming together, and that‚Äôs what we need right now.‚Äù More than 500 people were still in line at 5 p.m., when the viewing was scheduled to end. Among those still waiting was Ann Shepard, of Columbia, who had known Pinckney for more than 20 years. It had been ‚Äúa very difficult day,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a while before people can process this,‚Äù Shepard said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be overnight. This is going to go on for a long time.‚Äù Frances Washington, 57, of Greenwood, said the wait was worth it to bid farewell to her ‚Äúloyal, faithful, truthful‚Äù college classmate at Allen University. ‚ÄúThis won‚Äôt be in vain,‚Äù Washington said. ‚ÄúSomething good will come of it.‚Äù For privacy, a black drape covered the large second-floor lobby window where Pinckney lay in state. It also blocked the view of the Confederate battle flag atop a 30-foot pole at a Confederate Soldier Monument on the Statehouse grounds. The rebel flag has become a flashpoint in South Carolina and beyond since the killings. Hundreds have rallied at the Statehouse demanding that the flag be removed as a symbol of racism. Their calls have been joined by a growing number of state officials, including Haley, businesses and civil rights activists. A photo on a website linked to the accused killer, Dylann Roof of Eastover, shows him holding a Confederate flag. Pinckney‚Äôs casket passed the spot where the Confederate flag flew. House Democrats had earlier urged Haley to order that flag taken down temporarily under a provision that allows for it to be replaced when it is worn. Haley declined, saying she would be violating state law by making the claim. Pinckney made history as the youngest African-American elected to office when he won a House seat at age 23. On Wednesday, he became the second African-American to lie under the dome since Reconstruction. In 1986, the body of astronaut Ronald E. McNair, who died in the space shuttle Challenger explosion, was given the same honor. House members and senators took turns standing by the casket. Each senator donned a blue-and-white ribbon with the state crescent, symbolizing unity, made by Lexington Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy. Pinckney‚Äôs Senate deskmate, Vincent Sheheen, D-Camden, was among those who greeted mourners. He said Pinckney‚Äôs death has affected even those who didn‚Äôt know him. ‚ÄúI think everybody is still just coming to grips with the fact that this has really happened ‚Äî that it‚Äôs real,‚Äù Sheheen said as he began to weep. ‚ÄúI keep waiting for him to get up.‚Äù EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly stated that Pinckney was the first African-American to lie in state under the capitol dome since Reconstruction.

(Brad Nettles/Staff) 6/19/15 They came back on Wednesday. They walked through the back door by the parking lot, down two steps into the church basement and across the beige linoleum floor that one week ago was pockmarked with bullet holes and stained with blood. They came by the dozens and dozens until no chair was empty ‚Äî almost 200 people by one man‚Äôs count. First the older women arrived in skirts and dresses a full hour early. Then came the longtime parishioners and newcomers, media members and usual Bible study attendees, who, by some miracle, didn‚Äôt make it here last week. They came armed with their Bibles, wearing the armor of faith. A string trio played hymns in the back while a pair of fire marshals and a Charleston police officer stood watch. The slaying of nine people here last week couldn‚Äôt keep them away from another Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church. The Rev. Norvel Goff, Emanuel AME‚Äôs interim pastor, opened the evening‚Äôs lesson, about the power of love, with a little laughter and a song. ‚ÄúIf you live right, Heaven belongs to you. If you pray right, Heaven belongs to you. If you love right, Heaven belongs to you. Oh-oh, Heaven belongs to you.‚Äù The pastor didn‚Äôt stand at the lectern. In his clerical collar and crisp black jacket, he paced down the aisle between two sets of chairs. With his Bible in one hand and glasses in the other, he intoned from Scripture. ‚ÄúWhat kind of love is it that God has for us?‚Äù he bellowed. ‚ÄúUnconditional!‚Äù they replied. He quoted John 3:16 from the King James Bible: God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. He called for testimony of God‚Äôs love. One man said he was healed from a cancer. One woman recovered from a house fire that destroyed almost everything she owned, another from suicidal thoughts, another from a pulmonary embolism. And he called them to ban hate from their hearts, ‚Äúnot because we are weak, but because we are strong.‚Äù He closed with First Peter 4:8: Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sin. ‚ÄúMany of our hearts our broken, but only God can fix a broken heart.‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my testimony.‚Äù Outside 110 Calhoun St., television news cameras rolled around Mother Emanuel‚Äôs iron gate waiting for Goff‚Äôs audience. But inside, they lingered, laughing and embracing, taking photos and wishing one another a blessed night. Marjorie McIver posed for a picture with her loved ones. Her sister Myra Thompson was killed while leading last week‚Äôs Bible study. ‚ÄúGod loves us. He‚Äôs forgiven us of our sins. It behooves us to forgive others,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat message of love, even for your enemies, even for those who use you, who despise you. That‚Äôs a powerful message.‚Äù So McIver has to forgive.

Question: Process: - Blood carried into kidney by the renal artery - Nephrons in the kidney filter the blood - The waste that is filtered out mixes with water - Become urine - Ureters carry urine out of the kidneys. Question: suppose drinking sufficient amounts of water happens, how will it affect the urine is healthy. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"Drinking sufficient amounts of water can have notable effects on urinary health. To answer the question explicitly, we will consider the options provided: A: More B: Less C: No effect The correct answer is A: More. When a person consumes an adequate amount of water, several benefits can be observed in terms of urinary health. 1. Increased urine production: Drinking sufficient water causes the kidneys to produce more urine. This is because the body has more water available for filtration and excretion through the urinary system. The increased urine production helps in maintaining the overall water balance within the body. 2. Dilution of urine: Drinking ample water dilutes the urine, lowering the concentrations of waste products and salts in it. This diluted urine is less likely to form crystals or stones in the kidneys and the urinary tract, reducing the risk of kidney stones. 3. Frequent urination: Consuming appropriate amounts of water results in more frequent urination. This continual flushing of the urinary system keeps the bladder and ureters clean and free from harmful bacteria, minimizing the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). 4. Proper kidney function: Adequate water intake supports healthy kidney function. Kidneys play a crucial role in removing waste and excess salts from the blood, maintaining proper electrolyte balance, and regulating blood pressure. When the kidneys have sufficient water, they can filter waste and toxins more efficiently. 5. Urine color and odor: Sufficient water intake can lead to lighter, clearer urine, which is typically a sign of good hydration and a healthy urinary system. Adequate hydration can also help reduce any strong urine odors. In summary, drinking enough water positively affects urinary health, as it leads to increased urine production. This increase in urine production results in more frequent urination, dilution of waste products and salts, and proper kidney function. Consequently, the risk of kidney stones and urinary tract infections is diminished, and urine appears lighter and clearer, with a less intense odor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor PUBLISHED: 09:28 EST, 24 July 2013 | UPDATED: 11:08 EST, 24 July 2013 Jane Austen is to become the face of the new ¬£10 note after a public outcry that every banknote featured a man. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney today unveiled the new design as a tribute to ‚Äòone of the greatest writers in English literature‚Äô which will appear from 2017. The move comes after the Bank faced criticism that a plan for Winston Churchill to feature on the new fiver meant there would not be a woman on any English note. 'To hear","completion":"that Jane Austen is to feature on the new ¬£10 note is fantastic news, and a testament to the public's affection for one of the greatest writers in English literature,' said Mr. Carney at a press conference held at the Jane Austen House Museum in Chawton, Hampshire. As the news spread, it was met with a mixed response. Some people praised the decision as a nod to gender equality and a representation of one of the most influential women in British history. Feminist campaigners celebrated the Bank's decision to feature Austen, who ranks among the literary greats such as William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Writer and activist Caroline Criado-Perez, who launched the initial campaign to have a woman featured on the banknotes, expressed her joy at the announcement, stating that the inclusion of Jane Austen was a victory for women's representation. However, others argued that there were many other deserving women who could have been featured, particularly those who had made significant achievements in science, politics, or activism. Critics questioned the decision to include another literary figure when there were already numerous writers featured on current banknotes, arguing that it would have been more appropriate to honor a woman from a different field. As the design process for the new ¬£10 note began, it featured an image of Jane Austen based on a portrait commissioned by her nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh, in 1870. Banknote designer Debbie Marriott worked closely with historians and Austen experts to ensure the image's authenticity and capture Austen's spirit. In addition to Austen's portrait, the new note design featured elements inspired by her life and works, including an image of her writing desk, a quill, and quotes from her novels. The new ¬£10 note entered circulation in 2017 and received widespread praise for its aesthetic appeal and use of innovative security features such as a clear window with the Queen's portrait and a hologram of the coronation crown. A special event marked the launch of the new note, held at Winchester Cathedral, where Jane Austen was interred. Despite the initial controversy surrounding the choice of Jane Austen, it was clear that the public had embraced the new ¬£10 note. It served as a lasting tribute to Austen's literary legacy and her impact on British culture, while also promoting the conversation around women's representation and highlighting the importance of representation across various fields. Over time, in the spirit of equal representation, the Bank of England continued to introduce new banknotes featuring other influential female figures from diverse fields on its banknotes. This ongoing effort served as a reminder of the many exceptional women who contributed to shaping British history and society over the centuries. In conclusion, the story of introducing Jane Austen on the new ¬£10 note showcases the power of public opinion in influencing decisions and shaping our society. It is a testament to Austen's lasting impact on English literature and a symbol of the importance of diversity and equal representation in honoring the diverse figures who have contributed to history across different fields. The story ends with Jane Austen's portrait proudly featured on the ¬£10 note, and the subsequent waves of celebration and debate over the historical significance of this design decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Walt Whitman was born in 1819 in Long Island, New York. Whitman received most of his education outside of the classroom. At the age of eleven, he worked in a law office as an office boy where he became interested in reading. He was soon reading the works of famous authors like William Shakespeare and Homer, and was well on his way to becoming one of America's most well-known poets. By the time Whitman was seventeen years old, he had already worked as a printer's learner, a worker, and a learning games to help his students with spelling and maths. In his early twenties, however, he gave up teaching to pursue a full-time career as a journalist and poet. When Walt Whitman first appeared as a poet, his arrival onto the American literary scene was met with controversy. His first collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, was so unusual that no commercial publisher would print the work. In 1855 Whitman published, at his own expense, the first edition of his collection of twelve poems. Whitman's poetic style was uncommon I the sense that he wrote poems in a form called parallelism , in which his goal was to copy the flow of the sea and the quickly-passing nature of human emotion. A common theme in Whitman's poetry is self-realization. In his work, Whitman moves from conventional patterns of rhyme to create a unique rhythm and a multi-layered, but truly American voice. \\"Although Whitman was considered a revolutionary by many, there is little doubt he loved his country deeply.\\" In his writing, he used slang and various images, or voices, to create a sense of national unity.

The event is a car bomb explosion near a U.S. military vehicle. - The phrase 'in the northern Iraq city of Mosul' further clarifies the location of the event, which is the city of Mosul in Northern Iraq. - The part 'wounding five US soldiers, the military said' informs about the aftermath of the car bomb explosion. Five U.S. soldiers were wounded in the incident. - The information source, as given in the text is \\"the military\\". Therefore, it can be assumed that the statement is likely an official one. All considered, my analysis of the text leads me to conclude that it's detailing a violent incident involving a car bomb explosion in Mosul, Iraq, where an American armored vehicle was targeted, injuring five U.S. soldiers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What winemaker was a member of the band Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty? Answer:","completion":"The winemaker who was a member of the band Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty is Maynard James Keenan. He is a versatile artist who, besides being a musician, has also become a reputable winemaker in recent years. Keenan is perhaps best known for his work with the progressive rock band Tool, where he is the vocalist, but his involvement in the music world spans multiple bands and genres. One of his earliest musical projects was the band Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty (also known as C.A.D.), which he formed in the mid-1980s. This band featured a more experimental sound, blending elements of rock, electronic and avant-garde music. They recorded two albums, \\"Fingernails\\" and \\"Dog.House\\", gaining a small but devoted following. As his career progressed, Keenan also formed other bands such as A Perfect Circle, founded in 1999. This group continued to explore alternative and progressive rock, although with a more accessible sound than Tool. Keenan's musical journey continued with the formation of Puscifer, an experimental music project that embraces a range of genres and multimedia elements. Parallel to his successful musical career, Maynard James Keenan has also pursued his passion for winemaking, turning it into a thriving business. In 2004, he founded Caduceus Cellars in Jerome, Arizona. The winery focuses on producing high-quality, small-batch wines, with a strong emphasis on sustainability and local terroir. Among the wines produced by Caduceus Cellars are red blends, single varietals, and whites, reflecting Keenan's commitment to the art of winemaking and his desire to elevate the recognition of Arizona's wine industry. In summary, Maynard James Keenan, the winemaker who was a member of the band Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, has forged a successful dual career in both the music and wine industries. His passion for creativity and skillful artistry is evident in everything he does, making him a unique figure who has managed to excel in diverse and seemingly unrelated fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded.

We need to find the value of \\"m\\" that makes this equation true. The equation is: -4 * m + 287 * m = -229 * m + 46049 + 5663 First, let's combine the \\"m\\" terms on both sides. On the left side, we can add \\"-4 * m\\" and \\"287 * m\\" together. That will give us \\"283 * m\\".

Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases.

It emphasizes the status of Pill Hill in connection to Brookline and indicates that the annexation event changed Pill Hill's affiliation from Boston to Brookline.

Is this the main bathroom; one that will be used by everyone? Is this a secondary lavatory that is intended more for your children? Are you looking to redo the entire master suite including the private washroom? Selecting the right bath accessories sets can greatly enhance the overall aesthetic and functionality of your bathroom. In order to make an appropriate choice, consider the following factors: 1. Determine the room's purpose: Understanding the primary use of the bathroom can help you find the right accessories to suit its occupants' needs. If the bathroom is for everyone, opt for sets that offer practicality and accommodate various preferences. If it's meant for your children, accessories should be easy to use and have child-friendly features. If it's associated with a master suite, luxury and comfort might be prioritized. 2. Establish a theme or color scheme: Before choosing bath accessories sets, decide on a theme or color scheme that complements your existing bathroom design. This may range from modern and sleek to classic and vintage. Consider coordinating the accessories with elements like paint color, tiles, or fixtures for a cohesive look. 3. Assess the space available: Take into account the size of your bathroom, and choose accessories that will fit comfortably without overcrowding. Keep in mind the locations of electrical outlets, plumbing, and fixtures to ensure your accessories are installed or positioned safely and conveniently. 4. Prioritize functionality: While aesthetics are important, bathroom accessories should also serve a functional purpose. Towel racks, soap dispensers, and shelving units are essential for storage and organization, while items like bath mats and shower curtains help to maintain cleanliness and safety. 5. Evaluate quality and durability: Bath accessories should be able to withstand constant use in a damp environment. Choose sets made from materials like stainless steel, ceramic, or glass to ensure long-lasting durability, and avoid low-quality plastic accessories, which could break or wear out more quickly. 6. Set a budget: Determine a reasonable budget for your bathroom accessories before shopping. This will help you narrow down the options and make decisions based on quality without going overboard with spending. 7. Research brands and customer reviews: Spend some time researching reputable brands and reading customer reviews to gather feedback on product quality, durability, and overall satisfaction. This can help weed out poorly manufactured items and guide you towards long-lasting, reliable accessories. 8. Mix and match: If you can't find a complete bath accessories set that matches your desired style or color scheme, consider combining different individual items to create a customized, cohesive look. 9. Don't forget the details: Small things like toothbrush holders, toilet brush sets, and wastebaskets often go overlooked but can make a significant impact on a bathroom's overall appearance and functionality. By carefully considering these factors and assessing your specific needs, you can make an informed decision when selecting bath accessories sets that will enhance your bathroom's style, utility, and comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: - Thomas Fothergill - was - an English academic administrator - at the University of Oxford Sentence 2: - Thomas Fothergill D.D. - was - an academic English administrator - at the University of Oxford Step 2: Compare the identified key components. - Both sentences mention the name \\"Thomas Fothergill,\\" but the second sentence includes the title \\"D.D.\\" (Doctor of Divinity). It's possible that this title refers to the same person, but it could also be indicating a different person with the same name. - Both sentences include the University of Oxford as the location. - Both sentences mention \\"academic administrator\\" as the occupation, with the only difference being the word \\"English\\" coming before \\"academic\\" in the first sentence, and it comes before \\"administrator\\" in the second sentence. Step 3: Determine if the sentences mean the same. Although both sentences are quite similar and suggest that they are about the same person, there is a possibility that due to the inclusion of \\"D.D.\\" in the second sentence, they could be referring to different individuals. Moreover, the slight change in the wording regarding the occupation makes it unclear if the English adjective relates to the person's nationality or the language. Conclusion: It is most likely that these sentences refer to the same person, Thomas Fothergill, who was an academic administrator at the University of Oxford. However, the differences between the sentences, especially the addition of the title \\"D.D.\\" and the change in the adjective placement, make it impossible to say with 100% certainty that they mean the same thing."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Renault's new Twizy could be the future of motoring ... or at least a big part of it. This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge. Only time will tell if this brave move answers enough problems to find a place in our lives. Question: In which part of a magazine can we most probably read this text?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Instead of one super long break, take a few short breaks in between different assignments. Maybe have a five minute break for a snack after 30-60 minutes of work. Take five minutes to stretch, pop outside for a walk, or do something active, instead of just sitting and checking Facebook. It's important to make sure that you aren't sitting at a desk for hours and hours at a time. When you don't take breaks, the work can seem kind of endless. Productivity and concentration suffer, because you end up wasting some time doing other things like going on social media, doodling, or just doing poor work. Caffeine gives some students a much-needed jolt of concentration juice. For others, it's a fast-track to jittering around like a squirrel on speed. Don't drink more than the normal amount of coffee or caffeinated drink you usually consume. It will make concentrating harder. Better than caffeine is just staying hydrated. Drink water or juice instead to make sure your brain is functioning on all levels. It can be kind of hard to focus if you‚Äôre alone in a tiny room with just your books and papers. Sometimes it can be helpful to work out in the open where there are other people, or to study in a big group. They can be helpful in keeping you accountable. If you say that you‚Äôre working on an essay and they see you browsing Tumblr, they can point it out and keep you in check. As long as you're not sharing answers, working on homework together isn't cheating. Really, it's just smart time management and study skills. It's important to give yourself a reward for the hard work you're doing, each time you finish a task. Working toward a fun activity, treat, or some leisure time helps to motivate you to finish your work quickly, which means you'll have to concentrate. Try this: Cut some colored paper into strips or squares and write all of your assignments you have for that day. Put these in one pile. Create another pile with an equal number of rewards. Put checking your phone or Facebook page on one, playing a game for 10 minutes, watching the new episode on TV, or anything that you want to do or would do in your free time. When you finish one task, pick a treat from the pile of rewards. This is a great way to get work done and enjoy the things you like to do. Don't get too carried away with the rewards. Only one episode TV, not the rest of the season.","completion":"So, to make work easier and fun, do these things: 1. Take short breaks in between tasks instead of a super long break. 2.

Sometimes, working with friends can help you stay focused. 5. Reward yourself with something fun after finishing a task. 6. Make a game using colored paper for your tasks and rewards.

Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

This statement can be perceived as positive sentiment as it indicates some level of engagement and socialization in the platform. However, on the other hand, the user also states that they \\"still prefer Facebook,\\" which implies a preference for another platform and potentially indicates a more negative sentiment towards Twitter. By expressing their preference for Facebook, the user may be conveying dissatisfaction with the Twitter user experience, platform features, or even the community in comparison to what they find more enjoyable or satisfying in Facebook.

Step 2: Determine the narrative This might be a chronologically ordered event; in the typical career path in football management, it's common for a manager to lead more than one team over time. The sentence I will generate aims to reflect this chronological possible sequence. Step 3: Create the sentence \\"Peter St√∂ger, who used to manage FK Austria Wien, is now the manager of 1. FC K√∂ln.\\" In conclusion, I created a coherent sentence that uses all the provided information and inferred a chronological relation between the two clubs and the manager, Peter St√∂ger. The sentence structure ascertains past and current associations, thereby providing a narrative that aligns with the common framework of a football manager's career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does word \\"head\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Head the fish. This student heads the class.","completion":"No, the word \\"head\\" doesn't have the same meaning in the two sentences \\"Head the fish\\" and \\"This student heads the class\\". Even though \\"head\\" is used as a verb in both sentences, its context and implied action are different due to its versatile definitions. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Head the fish\\", the term ‚Äúhead‚Äù is used in the context of culinary preparation. In this regard, ‚Äúto head‚Äù means \\"to remove the head from a fish\\". Therefore, it‚Äôs used to indicate the act of preparing a fish for cooking or eating by cutting off its head. This usage probably comes from the literal sense of \\"head\\" denoting the upper part of the human body, or the part of an animal corresponding to the human head. 2. In the second sentence, \\"This student heads the class\\", ‚Äúhead‚Äù has a different implication altogether. It is generally used in the context of leadership or being in the foremost place. So, ‚Äúto head‚Äù means \\"to lead, to be in charge of, or to be in the top position of\\" something. In this sentence, stating that a student heads the class suggests that he or she is at the top of the class, either academically (like being the top scorer), or in a leadership role (like being a class president). This usage of \\"head\\" comes from its metaphorical sense, indicating \\"foremost part\\" or \\"leading position\\". Thus, the meaning of \\"head\\" varies in these two sentences based upon its contextual usage. As we just discussed, this word even though common in spelling exhibits different meanings when used in different situations, which makes English such a versatile and rich language. The key to understanding such words often lies in understanding the context in which they are used. This is an example of a Polysemy situation in English, where a single word can have multiple meanings depending on the context it's used in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title: Israeli troops killed three Egyptian policemen mistaken for Palestinian militants along the Gaza-Egypt border early Thursday, in what the army called a \\"professional and operational\\" mishap.","completion":"Title: \\"A Tragic Misunderstanding: The Unfortunate Killing of Egyptian Policemen by Israeli Troops Along the Gaza-Egypt Border Due to Mistaken Identity\\" Introduction: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been a complex and sensitive issue, marked by frequent clashes between the two sides. Ensuring the safety of Israeli citizens and maintaining a firm stance against terrorism have been top priorities for the Israeli government, leading them to engage in numerous security operations in the region. Although Israeli troops are often praised for their discipline and professionalism, they are not immune to errors. One such tragic mistake took place in the early hours of Thursday, when a group of Egyptian policemen were mistakenly identified as Palestinian militants and killed by Israeli forces along the Gaza-Egypt border. Background: Israel shares its southern border with Egypt and Gaza, making it a strategically significant area. Over the years, the border has been host to a variety of hostile activities and encounters, such as smuggling, infiltration, and terrorist attacks. This heightened tension along the border necessitates regular patrols by Israeli forces to deter and intercept potential threats. Unfortunately, these patrols can occasionally lead to unintended consequences, as seen in this incident. The Incident: On that fateful Thursday morning, Israeli forces were conducting a routine patrol along the Gaza-Egypt border when they came across a group of individuals that they believed to be armed Palestinian militants. Operating under this mistaken belief, the troops engaged the group in a firefight, ultimately killing three Egyptian policemen. The Israeli army later confirmed the true identity of the deceased, expressing deep regret and acknowledging the incident as a \\"professional and operational\\" mishap. Factors Contributing to the Tragic Mistake: Evaluating the factors that contributed to this mistake reveals several shortcomings in the Israeli forces' decision-making process that day. First and foremost, it was likely that the pressure to maintain a strong security presence along the border as well as the constant threat perception influenced the troops' actions. Additionally, the lack of clear identification markers distinguishing Egyptian policemen from potential threats or militants contributed to the confusion. It is also possible that poor communication and coordination between Israeli and Egyptian forces played a part in the mishap. The Aftermath and Lessons Learned: Following the realization of their mistake, the Israeli government was quick to extend condolences to the families of the deceased and the Egyptian government. In an effort to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, the Israeli military adapted measures such as improved communication and coordination with their Egyptian counterparts, as well as further training of their personnel to better differentiate between threats and friendly forces. Conclusion: The unfortunate killing of three Egyptian policemen along the Gaza-Egypt border stands as a stark reminder of the potential for mistakes in a high-tension environment like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It underscores the need for vigilance, communication, and cooperation between all stakeholders in the region in order to minimize the risk of future misunderstandings. It is hoped that lessons learned from this tragedy will help prevent similar incidents and contribute to a safer and more peaceful environment along the border."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the following sentence. The drying machine was disposable at this point, but we still relied on the washboard, as the","completion":"The drying machine was disposable at this point, but we still relied on the washboard, as the nostalgic, cost-effective, and eco-friendly option for cleaning our clothes. Though advancements in the world of laundry appliances have significantly improved the convenience and efficiency of doing laundry, there are still various reasons that explain why the washboard remained essential at this stage. Firstly, the washboard served as an excellent back-up tool in case of mechanical failures in modern electric dryers. Dryers, like any other appliances, were susceptible to breakdowns and malfunctions. In such situations, having a washboard on hand would help ensure that the laundry could still be done without much delay. The washboard also provided a reliable solution for those who lacked space and resources to invest in a dryer, further highlighting its relevance even amidst the rise of modern laundry appliances. Secondly, the washboard provided a low-cost laundry option, especially for those on a tight budget. The cost of purchasing and maintaining an electric dryer could sometimes put a strain on people's finances. By using a washboard, they had an effective method for cleaning clothes without incurring recurring expenses in terms of electricity consumption and repairs. Thirdly, the washboard played a crucial role in conserving energy and minimizing environmental impacts. As awareness about the detrimental effects of energy consumption and carbon emissions rose, many households opted for sustainable solutions to minimize their ecological footprint. A washboard required no electricity, and its water consumption was significantly lower compared to electric dryers. This allowed environmentally-conscious individuals to care for their garments while preserving the environment. Furthermore, the washboard was especially useful for delicate clothing items that required gentle handling and the avoidance of exposure to the high heat and aggressive tumbling of dryers. Materials like silk, lace, and cashmere frequently needed careful hand washing, and the washboard was a suitable and necessary tool for this purpose. Its design allowed for a more controlled cleaning process, ensuring that these delicate garments would maintain their texture and quality. In addition, the use of a washboard facilitated a traditional and hands-on approach to doing laundry. This process often fostered a sense of accomplishment and pride in a job well-done; instilling values of self-reliance and resourcefulness. Moreover, the practice of using a washboard for washing clothes could be a social activity that brought communities and families together, helping to strengthen ties and pass down traditional skills through generations. In conclusion, despite the advances in laundry technology, the washboard held its ground as an essential tool for various reasons. From offering a low-cost and eco-friendly alternative to serving as a reliable back-up and handling delicate fabrics, the washboard continued to find relevance even in the face of modern innovations. This not only highlighted the practicality and versatility of the washboard but also demonstrated the resilience of traditional methods in the ever-evolving world of technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English) in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota.

Possible answers:Choices: (A). no; (B). yes; Answer:","completion":"Answer: (B). yes; Explanation: In this context, the pronoun \\"them\\" refers back to the most recent group of people mentioned, who are the older students. The phrase \\"so we punished them\\" uses 'them' as a pronoun to replace a proper noun (name of a person, place or thing). The proper noun that 'them' is replacing in this sentence is 'The older students.' The sentence talks about an action (bullying) that was done by the older students which called for a reaction (punishment). The action of punishing is directed to the group that did the incorrect action, in this case \\"the older students\\". Therefore, when the sentence says \\"so we punished them\\", 'them' is referring to \\"the older students\\". This is a common structure in English called Anaphora, where a pronoun refers back to another noun, pronoun, or noun phrase earlier in the sentence or paragraph, known as the antecedent. The pronoun 'them' is used to avoid the repetition for the antecedent 'the older students' in the same sentence. The pronoun used depends on the gender and number of the antecedent: for example, 'it' is used for singular and non-human items, 'he' or 'she' for single gender-specific humans, and 'they' or 'them' for plural or non-gender-specified humans.

Which team learned more about turtles? Team A and Team B were two teams of students studying zoology. Team A learned about reptiles, while Team B studied more about amphibians. Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Part #3: Output the list of integers for every multiplication result with the same length as the number of input lists. Usage: [1275, 0, -11, -7, -515517] Explanation: There should be 5 integers in the output list, corresponding to the 5 inner lists in the input. Each integer is the result of multiplying odd numbers in the respective inner list. Part #4: If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, output 0 for that list. Usage: In the second inner list [24, -30, -8, 18, 18], there are no odd numbers, so the output for this list should be 0.

Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Ma√Ωr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work‚ÄîCzech opera as a genre scarcely existed‚ÄîSmetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umƒõleck√° Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper... answer the following question: What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Los Angeles (CNN)The last hand in the \\"two thumbs up\\" film critic team, Roger Ebert, died Thursday, two days after revealing cancer returned to his body. Ebert and Gene Siskel co-hosted the iconic review show \\"Siskel and Ebert At The Movies\\" until Siskel's death in 1999 after a battle with a brain tumor. The Chicago Sun-Times, the base of operations for Ebert's syndicated reviews, announced his death at age 70.\\"We were getting ready to go home today for hospice care, when he looked at us, smiled, and passed away. No struggle, no pain, just a quiet, dignified transition,\\" his wife, Chaz Ebert, said in a statement Thursday. \\"I'll see you at the movies,\\" were the last words Ebert wrote to his readers. They were published in an essay titled \\"Leave of Presence\\" on his blog Tuesday, in which he explained he was planning to slow down and reduce the number of movie reviews he wrote. \\"My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me,\\" Ebert wrote. \\"What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.\\" Ebert had already lost his voice and much of his jaw after battling thyroid and salivary gland cancer. He suffered a hip fracture in December, and it recently led to the revelations about cancer, he said. Ebert started as the Sun-Times film critic on April 3, 1967, writing about 200 reviews each of those 46 years, he said. The last year however, was his most prolific. \\"Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles,\\" he said. \\"I must slow down now, which is why I'm taking what I like to call 'a leave of presence.'\\" Ebert: The critical critic with an open mind. Ebert, who won a Pulitzer Prize for film criticism in 1975, had a way with words and a sharp wit that is not easily matched. -- About Rob Schneider's \\"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\\" in 2005: \\"If he's going to persist in making bad movies, he's going to -- have to grow accustomed to reading bad reviews.\\" -- Concerning Schneider's reaction to another critic who panned the film: \\"But Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed \\"Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\\" while passing on the opportunity to participate in \\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" \\"Ray,\\" \\"The Aviator,\\" \\"Sideways\\" and \\"Finding Neverland.\\" As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks.\\" Two years later, flowers showed up at Ebert's door with a card, signed \\"Your Least Favorite Movie Star, Rob Schneider.\\" \\"The bouquet didn't change my opinion of his movie, but I don't think he intended that,\\" Ebert wrote. \\"It was a way of stepping back. It was a reminder that in the great scheme of things, a review doesn't mean very much. Sometimes when I write a negative review, people will say, 'I'll bet you can't wait to hammer his next film.' Not true. I would far rather praise the next film to show that I maintained an open mind.\\" -- A good example of Ebert's willingness to keep an open mind comes from his review of Tom Green's 2001 comedy \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\" of which he wrote one of his most scathing reviews:. \\"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.\\" But after watching Green in \\"Stealing Harvard\\" a year later, Ebert revisited the film that he had awarded a rare zero stars:. \\"But the thing is, I remember 'Freddy Got Fingered' more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn't have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing.\\" -- Reviewing \\"Crocodile Dundee II\\": \\"I've seen audits that were more thrilling.\\" -- Giving no love to \\"Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\\": \\"To say that George Lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion.\\" Ebert: The film philosopher. -- \\"Every great film should seem new every time you see it.\\" -- \\"No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough.\\" -- \\"If you have to ask what it symbolizes, it didn't.\\" -- \\"If a movie isn't a hit right out of the gate, they drop it. Which means that the whole mainstream Hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy.\\" -- \\"I am utterly bored by celebrity interviews. Most celebrities are devoid of interest.\\" Ebert: Remembered. --Wife Chaz Ebert: \\"I am devastated by the loss of my love, Roger -- my husband, my friend, my confidante and oh-so-brilliant partner of over 20 years. He fought a courageous fight. I've lost the love of my life and the world has lost a visionary and a creative and generous spirit who touched so many people all over the world. We had a lovely, lovely life together, more beautiful and epic than a movie. It had its highs and the lows, but was always experienced with good humor, grace and a deep abiding love for each other. \\"Roger was a beloved husband, stepfather to Sonia and Jay, and grandfather to Raven, Emil, Mark and Joseph. Just yesterday he was saying how his grandchildren were 'the best things in my life.' He was happy and radiating satisfaction over the outpouring of responses to his blog about his 46th year as a film critic. But he was also getting tired of his fight with cancer, and said if this takes him, he has lived a great and full life.\\" -- American Film Institute president and CEO Bob Gazzale: \\"Roger Ebert championed the art of the moving image and by the courage of his personal example demonstrated how much movies matter. Ebert chaired the AFI AWARDS jury of critics, filmmakers and scholars who selected the year's 10 best films in 2004. He held the gavel that day with the same enthusiasm for excellence that made his voice a force in American popular culture.\\" -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel: \\"Our whole city learned with sadness today of the passing of Roger Ebert, whose name was synonymous with two things: the movies and Chicago. In a Pulitzer Prize winning career that spanned more than four decades, thousands of reviews and countless acts of generosity to others, Roger championed Chicago as a center for filmmaking and critiques. With a knowledge of his subject as deep as his love for his wife Chaz, Roger Ebert will be remembered for the strength of his work, respected for his courage in the face of illness, and revered for his contribution to filmmaking and to our city. The final reel of his life may have run through to the end, but his memory will never fade.\\" -- Sun-Times Media Editor in Chief Jim Kirk: \\"The long relationship between Roger and his Sun-Times family speaks volumes about Roger's commitment to his craft and to his fans around the world. Roger's reviews were highly anticipated by readers and the film community. Film commentary was only one of several gifts. He was a reporter first, in every aspect of his craft. He could write as eloquently about world affairs as he could on the upcoming blockbuster. Roger will be missed not only by the Sun-Times family, but by the journalism and film communities. Our thoughts are with Roger's wife, Chaz, and their family during this time.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A famous movie critic named Roger Ebert passed away after his cancer came back.

Movie plot title: Australia Movie plot: The movie opens with information about World War II and its effect on Australia. It then transitions to the issue of Stolen Generations - the attempt of whites to take away aboriginal children and place them in missions to phase out the culture.Then the movie begins, with King George, an aboriginal medicine man/witch doctor showing Nullah how to do various things in the outback. KG shows him how to fish, and Nullah successfully catches one with a spear. However, behind them is a commotion and they see cattle being driven across the river. KG tells Nullah to become invisible (he hides underwater) and a man falls dead into the water, with blood swirling around him, and an arrowhead coming out of his chest. It seems KG might have done this because, Nullah tells the audience that KG does not like white men, and he was killed by an arrow.Nullah surfaces and a horse rears in the water. He sings to the horse and it comes over, calmly. He rides it back to where he lives, Faraway Downs. He jumps down off the horse after he sees a car coming down the road. He runs and hides in the water tower, afraid someone is going to come take him away (Stolen Generation).But its not people to take him away, but rather Drover (Hugh Jackman), Sarah (Nicole Kidman), Magarri, and another aborigine.Nullah, who has narrated some of the story, informs us that this story starts a while ago in another faraway place called England... Lady Sarah Ashley is off riding horses when a car pulls up with a man trying to convince Sarah not to sell Faraway Downs. She, while walking through a stable of horses, insists they could use the money. She goes to ride on another horse, finally telling the man that she will go down to Australia and sell it herself.The film then follows Sarah on a plane, receiving various messages from her husband that she need not come down to Australia.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I‚Äôll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don‚Äôt remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn‚Äôt do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I‚Äôm forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Options: - To provide them with some relief from the snow - Because she owed them money - not enough information - Because it was the only work available in the area === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"To provide them with some relief from the snow"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LG says flexible displays are real LG Displays announced plans to begin mass production of a roll-up, plastic display screen Thursday -- potentially leading to tablets, iPads or even TVs you can roll up and stuff into a bag. But don't throw out that old flat panel display just yet. Bendable screens have been a dream of the electronics industry since they were merely a twinkle in George Jetson‚Äôs eye. LCD manufacturing giant LG and others have been pursuing such display technology for years. And on Thursday, March 29, LG Displays said the world‚Äôs first roll-up screen -- something it calls an electronic paper display, or EPD -- would be released to gadget makers in Europe next month. \\"With the world's first plastic EPD, LG Display has once again proven its reputation for leadership and innovation with a product we believe will help greatly popularize the E-Book market,\\" said Mr. Sang Duck Yeo, head of operations for LG Display's Mobile/OLED division. \\"We are excited as we look toward applying concepts from this experience to future developments like plastic OLED and flexible displays,\\" he added. But don't reach for your wallet just yet. Alfred Poor, a display industry expert and the brains behind HDTVProfessor.com, said the announcement was less revolutionary than evolutionary. \\"This is a relatively small development in the grand scheme of things,\\" Poor told FoxNews.com, ticking off a list of items that may make such displays less appealing to consumers. \\"This appears to be a monochrome (black and white) epaper display. This means that it ... has low power consumption, but it also means that it's probably slow and not suitable for moving images such as video. It's not in color, and probably has limited grayscale capabilities,\\" he added. The company said its 6-inch e-ink, plastic screen is destined first for the e-book market; the new screen offers a paper-like reading experience, in spite of the ability to bend up to 40 degrees. It weighs just half an ounce and is virtually impervious to shattering if dropped, a common problem with e-readers. Poor acknowledged that some of those features might be appealing, especially the light weight and improved durability. \\"This could result in some minor cost reductions through lower material costs, lighter weight, and smaller size for a device,\\" he said. \\"But the more significant point is that this could result in more durable displays for larger mobile devices. An ebook reader with a plastic display is more likely to survive a drop than one with a glass display,\\" Poor told FoxNews.com. LG said a technology breakthrough with high-temperature manufacturing allowed it to finally produce the screens. The company did not say when the screen would be made available to U.S. markets.","completion":"LG Displays has announced that they will start making roll-up, plastic display screens.

Continue the following story. Ryan hired Brian to prune their roses and plant some lavender because","completion":"Ryan was extremely busy with work and other responsibilities. Brian, a professional gardener with years of experience, was known for his ability to create beautiful and thriving gardens. When Ryan came across his portfolio, they couldn't resist the opportunity to give their garden the expert touch it needed. Brian's extensive knowledge of plants, pruning techniques, and landscaping design simplified Ryan's decision to hire him for the job. On the day Brian arrived to work on Ryan's garden, the morning dew glistened on the rose bushes, giving the area a magical aura. As Brian assessed the garden, he quickly realized that the roses needed immediate attention. The glorious rose bushes looked unkempt, and several branches were entangling and overcrowding each other. Ryan had noticed the wilting of the rose petals, but with the lack of time and knowledge about proper care, those poor roses had paid the price. Brian quickly got to work, meticulously snipping away dead and damaged branches while ensuring the plants maintained their shape and charm. As he pruned, he offered valuable advice to Ryan on optimal watering schedules, routine maintenance, and the right amount of sunlight required for the roses to thrive. Brian's friendly demeanor made it easy for Ryan to approach him with questions. Once the rose bushes were skillfully pruned and looking vibrant again, Brian moved on to plant the lavender. He carefully selected the most suitable area in the garden, ensuring ample sunlight and well-drained, loose soil. Brian knew the lavender plants would not only bring a pleasant fragrance to the space, but also serve as a vital source of nectar for butterflies and bees. As he prepared the soil, Ryan watched in awe at how much precision and care Brian had for each aspect of the job. That day, Ryan gained a new appreciation for the art of gardening. Using a spade, Brian dug small holes with ample space between them to accommodate the mature size of the lavender plants. He placed each plant into the holes and carefully backfilled the soil, gently tapping down the soil to establish a firm connection. While working on the lavender, Brian noticed Ryan's interest in the process and gladly shared his knowledge of different lavender varieties, as well as their distinct characteristics, medicinal, and culinary uses. His explanations piqued Ryan's interest in exploring other plants to add to the garden. Once the task was complete, the garden had truly transformed. The roses were now blooming with an intense vigor, and the lavender plants were beaming with promise. Ryan couldn't have been more thrilled with Brian's work. For the following months, Ryan made sure to follow Brian's detailed instructions, careful not to miss an important detail. The garden had become a delightful sanctuary for Ryan to escape the pressures of daily life. Their newfound passion for gardening bloomed, as their garden became a home for butterflies, bees, and even a few hummingbirds. As the months passed by, Ryan occasionally called upon Brian for seasonal maintenance and to introduce new plant varieties to the garden. Each visit cemented a bond as friends and kindled Ryan's love for the ever-evolving world of gardening. In the end, Brian's visit forever changed Ryan's perspective on the importance of nurturing nature, and it taught them that the rewards of gardening extend far beyond tangible beauty or the delightful scents of flowers. It served as a reminder of the endless wonders that await those who engage wholeheartedly with the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Combined substances are either compounds or what? A: The answer is:","completion":"Combined substances are either compounds or mixtures. A compound is a substance formed when two or more elements chemically bond together, resulting in a new substance with unique properties that are different than those of the individual elements. Compounds have a fixed ratio of elements, and their composition cannot be altered by physical means. The elements in a compound are held together by chemical bonds, which can be either ionic bonds or covalent bonds. In contrast, a mixture is a combination of two or more substances in which each substance retains its individual properties and is not chemically bonded to the other substances. Mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous mixture, also known as a solution, has a uniform composition throughout and appears as a single phase. The particles in a homogeneous mixture are evenly distributed at the molecular or ionic level, and they are not visible to the naked eye. Examples of homogeneous mixtures include sugar dissolved in water, air, and alloys like brass or bronze. On the other hand, a heterogeneous mixture is characterized by the presence of multiple phases and a non-uniform composition. The particles in a heterogeneous mixture can often be seen with the naked eye or under a microscope. Examples of heterogeneous mixtures include oil and water, sand and water, and orange juice with pulp. In conclusion, combined substances can be classified into two categories: compounds, which are chemically bonded elements that form new substances with unique properties, and mixtures, which are combinations of substances in which each substance retains its individual properties and does not chemically bond with the other substances. Mixtures can be further classified as either homogeneous or heterogeneous based on their composition and appearance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, as a number of commentators have noted, the wording that follows this bumper-sticker appeal is somewhat more disturbing: Let his days be few; and let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

CHAPTER VII THE STATEMENT OF TIBBIE BIRSE On a Thursday Pete Lownie was buried, and when Hendry returned from the funeral Jess asked if Davit Lunan had been there. \\"Na,\\" said Hendry, who was shut up in the closet-bed, taking off his blacks, \\"I heard tell he wasna bidden.\\" \\"Yea, yea,\\" said Jess, nodding to me significantly. \\"Ay, weel,\\" she added, \\"we'll be hae'n Tibbie ower here on Saturday to deave's (weary us) to death aboot it.\\" Tibbie, Davit's wife, was sister to Marget, Pete's widow, and she generally did visit Jess on Saturday night to talk about Marget, who was fast becoming one of the most fashionable persons in Thrums. Tibbie was hopelessly plebeian. She was none of your proud kind, and if I entered the kitchen when she was there she pretended not to see me, so that, if I chose, I might escape without speaking to the like of her. I always grabbed her hand, however, in a frank way. On Saturday Tibbie made her appearance. From the rapidity of her walk, and the way she was sucking in her mouth, I knew that she had strange things to unfold. She had pinned a grey shawl about her shoulders, and wore a black mutch over her dangling grey curls. \\"It's you, Tibbie,\\" I heard Jess say, as the door opened. Tibbie did not knock, not considering herself grand enough for ceremony, and indeed Jess would have resented her knocking.

Trivia question: Who was the last French tennis player to win the men's singles title at the French Open? And the answer is?","completion":"The last French tennis player to win the men's singles title at the French Open is Yannick Noah. Noah achieved this historic feat on June 5, 1983. Born on May 18, 1960, in Sedan, France, Yannick Noah is a former professional tennis player who is considered one of the best in his home country's sports history. His win in 1983 was a significant moment for France, as he remains the only French player in more than three decades to have won the men's singles title at Roland Garros, which is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments on the tennis calendar. During the 1983 French Open, Yannick Noah entered the tournament as the 6th seed. He displayed a strong performance throughout the duration of the competition and defeated several notable players on his way to the final. In one of the tournament's early rounds, he eliminated 1980 French Open champion, Vitas Gerulaitis, in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, Yannick defeated another top player, Jose Higueras, who had previously reached the French Open final in 1982. In the final match of the 1983 French Open, Yannick Noah faced Swedish player Mats Wilander, who was the defending champion, having won the title in 1982. The epic clash took place on June 5, 1983, and Noah came out victorious in a thrilling four-set victory, with the final score being 6-2, 7-5, 7-6(7-3). This victory made him the first Frenchman to win the title since Marcel Bernard in 1946. The significance of Yannick Noah's accomplishment at the 1983 French Open Men's Singles Championship is emphasized by the fact that since then, no other French player has managed to win the title. This triumph is a reflection of Noah's hard work, dedication, and talent, making him an iconic figure in French sports history. Although Yannick Noah retired from professional tennis in 1996, he continued to make a significant impact on the sport as a successful team captain for the French Davis Cup team. Additionally, he embarked on a successful music career, further enhancing his status as a prominent French public figure. Today, Yannick Noah remains an enduring symbol of French tennis and sports achievements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"The timeline of radio lists within the history of radio , the technology and events that produced instruments that use radio waves and activities that people undertook.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the statement you provided in your question is a fairly broad summary of the history of radio as a whole and doesn't directly answer the question of who discovered amplitude modulation (AM) and made the first successful amplitude-modulated transmission of voice. To answer your question more directly and accurately, the concept of amplitude modulation (AM) was first demonstrated by a Canadian engineer named Reginald Fessenden in the early 20th century. Fessenden is most often credited with the pioneering development and practical demonstration of amplitude modulation radio transmission, which he accomplished in 1906. The story goes like this: Fessenden was working on a method of transmitting voice signals, which was far more complex than the Morse code signals that were commonly used at the time. Fessenden's method became known as Continuous Wave (CW) transmission. However, he realized that the CW transmission technique could not carry the frequency range of the human voice. His solution to this was amplitude modulation, where the strength (amplitude) of a continuous signal (wave) is adjusted according to the properties of the sound to be sent. On Christmas Eve, 1906, he used an alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, to make the first successful transmission of voice by radio waves. During this broadcast, Fessenden played a song on the violin, read a passage from the Bible, and wished his listeners a Merry Christmas. It's important to note that while Fessenden is recognized for the first successful amplitude-modulated transmission of voice, the concept of amplitude modulation was known in telegraphy systems prior to his work. However, Fessenden was the one who succeeded in applying it to radio transmission for audio signals, thus opening the door for the possibility of radio broadcasting as we know it today. In summary, while the technology and events involved in the history of radio are indeed diverse and complex, the discovery of AM and the first successful amplitude-modulated transmission of voice can be most directly attributed to Reginald Fessenden."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

St. Kitts, also known as Saint Christopher, was divided between the two nations under the Treaty of St. Christopher in 1627, with the English occupying the central part of the island and the French controlling the northern and southern ends. The island was strategically important to both nations, as it was a crucial stop for their ships traveling between Europe and the Caribbean. The colonies on St. Kitts exchanged hands several times between the English and French due to conflicts and wars, such as the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which allowed the English to maintain control of St. Kitts.

Ryback is taking his estranged niece Sarah Ryback (played by a then-unknown Heigl) to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Ryback's brother, who was Sarah's father. They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. As the train proceeds through the Rockies, two people wave it down. The driver and an engineer step out and are killed. A group of mercenaries led by computer genius Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian) and mercenary leader Penn (McGill) hijack the train. Dane is a satellite programming expert who worked on a top secret satellite laser weapon called \\"Grazer One\\". Dane was fired and faked his death. They herd the passengers and staff into the last two train cars and cut the train's phone lines. Two of Dane's former Department of Defense colleagues are on board the train, hiding their romantic relationship that goes against DoD regulations. Dane has them brought to him and threatens to have one of his mercenaries insert a burning needle into their eye, causing it to explode, unless they give him the codes needed to take over Grazer One. They give him the codes and Dane has them killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane one billion dollars to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer One to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon.

Given the question: Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bones are put underground more quickly happens, how will it affect animals eat more of the bones. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the bones being put underground more quickly does have an indirect effect on the process of fossilization. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the effects: 1. If the bones are put underground more quickly, it reduces the time that scavengers have to access and consume the bones. This results in fewer bones being eaten by scavengers. 2. With fewer bones eaten by scavengers, there will be a larger number of bones available for the fossilization process. This indirectly increases the possibility of a higher number of fossils being formed. 3. The quicker burial of bones also reduces the chances of bones being scattered further by wind and rain, keeping them more intact during the fossilization process. 4. This rapid burial will likely also aid in preserving the bones from weathering, as they will be protected from the elements by layers of soil and sediment. 5. Due to the increased preservation and higher number of fossils created, the chances of discovering fossils may also be indirectly affected, making them more accessible for scientists and researchers. Overall, the perturbation hypothesis of bones being put underground more quickly indirectly affects the fossilization process, impacting factors such as scavengers' access to bones, the scattering of bones, preservation from weathering, and the potential for fossil discovery."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this case, there are two options provided for continuing the story. Option (I) suggests that Laura has frizzy hair, and option (II) suggests that Angela has frizzy hair. Step 2: Consider the context of the original story. The original story states that Laura often wished her hair looked as good as Angela's hair. This implies that Laura may not be satisfied with her own hair's appearance or may be envious of Angela's hair. Step 3: Choose the option that makes the most narrative sense and provides a clear reason for Laura's dissatisfaction. Option (I) provides a direct reason for Laura's dissatisfaction with her own hair, as it mentions that she has frizzy hair. This option creates a scenario in which Laura wishes to have hair like Angela's because her own hair is difficult to manage or does not meet her desired appearance standards.

Memory Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to \\"see\\" more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling (1963) using the \\"partial report paradigm\\". Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments,Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the \\"whole report\\" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.

Lester's relationship with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening), an ambitious realtor who feels that she is unsuccessful at fulfilling her potential, is strained. His 16-year-old daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is unhappy and struggling with self-esteem issues. Lester himself is a self-described loser: boring, faceless and easy to forget. Lester is reinvigorated, however, when he meets Jane's friend and classmate, the egotistical Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) at a high school basketball game. Lester immediately develops an obvious infatuation with Angela, much to his daughter's embarrassment. Throughout the film, Lester has fantasies involving a sexually aggressive Angela and red rose petals. The Burnhams' new neighbors are Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper), his distracted wife Barbara (Allison Janney), and his camcorder-obsessed son Ricky (Wes Bentley). When confronted with the gay couple living two doors down, Col.

Answer:","completion":"Title: The Mask of Paul Genre: Psychological Thriller Plot Summary: Paul, a facially disfigured man, has been living a reclusive life to avoid society's judging eyes. However, his worst fear comes true when a chance encounter with Tina, an aspiring journalist, results in her witnessing his face and the terrible secret he carries. Paranoid by the thought of exposure, Paul is forced to confront his past and his own mind's demons while trying to secure a future free from judgment. The world wouldn't understand, that's what Paul had told himself since the accident that led to his disfigurement. Ten years of living in isolation had taught him to be self-reliant and to suppress his once strong desire to be a part of society, an acceptance that seemed unattainable now. As a skilled artist, Paul earned a living painting dark and intense portraits. Eager patrons intrigued by the mysterious artist would commission his enigmatic works, unaware of the man behind the canvases. As the story begins, Paul accidentally receives a package intended for his neighbor, Tina, a budding journalist. Intrigued by the package's content, a series of documents relating to an unsolved crime that took place on the same night as his accident, he decides to investigate. The incident involved the murder of a once-prominent businessman, a dark secret that many in the town want to remain buried. Tina, relentlessly focused on solving the crime and determined to get her big break, unknowingly gets involved with the same case and starts inching closer to the truth and, more importantly, Paul. Their paths eventually cross, and Tina sees a glimpse of his disfigured face. Paul panics and, fearing that Tina will unravel his secret, he abducts her and hides her away in his secluded dwelling. Isolated but defiant, Tina is distrustful of her captor but comes to understand his pain and the heavy burden he carries. But Paul's overwhelming fear and paranoia lead him down a dark path. Unable to fully trust Tina, he strangles her in a twisted attempt to protect the life he's built for himself. In an unexpected turn of events, Paul learns through a series of clues left by Tina that the real mastermind behind the murder was his own father, a former top official of the town who had framed his own son to cover up his crime. Strangled with guilt and remorse, Paul realizes that killing Tina wasn't the answer, and his life would never be free from the weight of his past. In a last-ditch attempt at redemption, Paul discovers the evidence needed to expose his father's crimes, ultimately sealing his fate. In a cathartic final confrontation, Paul confronts his father, but the confrontation escalates, leading to the death of both father and son. Following the shocking revelation, the town comes to learn about the truth behind the murder and the tragic fate of Paul, finally understanding the man who lived in the shadows. As the movie concludes, the world now remembers Paul not as the monster he believed himself to be, but as a tortured artist and a victim of his own family's betrayal. Ultimately, \\"The Mask of Paul\\" is a gripping and poignant portrayal of the internal struggle for acceptance, the burden of secrets, and the path to redemption in a society which is quick to judge based on outward appearances. The movie leaves audiences asking themselves, \\"What's truly monstrous, the disfigurement on a man's face, or society's bias and prejudice?\\""},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously","completion":"The sentiment expressed in the sentence \\"that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously\\" can be considered negative. There are multiple elements in the sentence that contribute to the negative sentiment. Firstly, the phrase \\"hard to take\\" implies that the speaker is experiencing difficulty in accepting or believing in the subject's spiritual quest. By using the word \\"hard,\\" it denotes a sense of struggle or resistance in relation to the event or situation described. Secondly, the adverb \\"seriously\\" gives an emphasis to the degree of difficulty in accepting the subject's spiritual quest. This word further illustrates that the speaker is not merely having a challenging time understanding the situation, but also raises questions about the credibility or sincerity of the subject's spiritual journey. Lastly, the use of the phrase \\"at all\\" prior to the word \\"seriously\\" intensifies the negative sentiment. It emphasizes that the speaker struggles to find any aspect of the spiritual quest to take seriously. When this phrase is used, it stresses the fact that the situation described is perceived as entirely lacking in credibility or legitimacy. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously\\" is distinctly negative. This stems from the use of phrases and words that express difficulty in understanding, doubt in credibility, and heightened questioning of the sincerity of the subject's spiritual quest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

Understand the event: In this case, the event is \\"PersonX makes a mountain out of a molehill.\\" This expression means that PersonX is exaggerating a small problem and making it seem much bigger than it actually is. 2. Identify the person: The given person is PersonX, the one who performs the action in the event. 3. Write about their intent: Consider why PersonX might have taken the action they did. What could be their motivation or reasoning for exaggerating a small problem? Some possible reasons could be: seeking attention, feeling overwhelmed, or trying to manipulate a situation. Choose one or more of these intents to explain PersonX's action. For example, you could write: \\"PersonX makes a mountain out of a molehill because they feel overwhelmed by even the smallest problems, and they struggle to keep things in perspective. By exaggerating the problem, PersonX hopes to gain sympathy and support from others to help them cope with their anxiety.\\" Remember to keep things concise and simple as you write about the person's intent behind their actions in the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What sea creature reproduces without gamete fusion?\\" and the following answer choices: - white - amoeba - embryos - a fish - alpacas - swea - Schwinn - polyp Now knowing that polyps usually reproduce asexually and plants with Asexual Reproduction Plants with asexual reproduction have no gamete fusion, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What sea creature reproduces without gamete fusion?\\" from the given choices is \\"polyp.\\" Polyps are small, soft-bodied organisms that are predominantly marine invertebrates, commonly found in the phylum Cnidaria. They can reproduce through asexual reproduction, which involves the formation of new individuals without the fusion of gametes. One of the primary ways polyps asexually reproduce is called budding, where a new individual grows out of the parent polyp's body, eventually breaking off and living independently. In contrast to sexual reproduction, which involves the combination of genetic material from two parent organisms to form offspring, asexual reproduction allows the parent organism to pass on its genetic information to its offspring without mixing it with any other organism. This method has several advantages, such as allowing organisms to reproduce quickly and efficiently in environments where mating may be difficult or scarce. The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons: - White: This is a color and not related to a sea creature or its reproductive process. - Amoeba: Although an amoeba is a single-celled organism that reproduces asexually by splitting in half, it is not technically a sea creature. It is primarily found in freshwater environments and some species are parasitic. - Embryos: This refers to the early stages of development in multicellular organisms, not a specific sea creature. - A fish: While some fish reproduce asexually, the term \\"a fish\\" is far too vague, as there are thousands of fish species with different reproductive modes. - Alpacas: These are terrestrial mammals native to South America, not sea creatures. - Swea: This term does not seem to correspond to any known organism or relevant concept. - Schwinn: This is a brand of bicycles and is not related to sea creatures or reproduction. In conclusion, a polyp is the most suitable answer to the question of which sea creature reproduces without gamete fusion, as polyps reproduce asexually, allowing them to create offspring without the need for a mating partner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. scorm is likely a poor fit or overkill if: Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"SCORM, which stands for Shareable Content Object Reference Model, is a set of technical standards for e-learning software products. It is likely to be a poor fit or an overkill in certain scenarios due to the reasons mentioned below: 1. Small-scale e-learning projects: If you are developing a small-scale e-learning project with a limited number of learning modules, SCORM might be an unnecessary addition to the project. SCORM can add complexity and require additional development and maintenance resources. 2. Customized or unique learning experiences: SCORM provides a standardized way of designing and delivering e-learning content, which can be a drawback when it comes to customized or unique learning experiences. If your project requires a high level of customization, SCORM's framework may limit your ability to provide tailored learning experiences. 3. Rapid deployment: SCORM-compliant content typically takes longer to produce, develop, and test as compared to custom solutions or other non-SCORM based solutions. If you need to deploy e-learning content rapidly, SCORM may not be the best fit, as the additional time required to make content SCORM-compliant may not be practically feasible. 4. Strict technological requirements: SCORM has specific technological requirements that must be met for successful implementation, such as compatible Learning Management Systems (LMS) and required software environments. If your organization does not have the resources to meet these requirements, SCORM might be overkill for your needs. 5. Budgetary constraints: Developing SCORM-compliant content can involve additional costs, including purchasing a compatible LMS, staff training, and licensing fees. For organizations with limited budgets or those that require a more cost-effective solution, SCORM may not be the ideal choice. 6. Offline learning: SCORM is primarily designed for delivering web-based content through an LMS, which means it is not well-suited to track and manage offline learning experiences. If your project involves a significant amount of offline training, SCORM might not be the best fit. 7. Limited integration with other systems: As a standard-based system, SCORM might not always be compatible with other learning technologies, platforms, or software solutions. If your organization relies heavily on the integration of different systems or non-SCORM learning technologies, SCORM might not be the optimal solution. Overall, when considering the implementation of SCORM in an e-learning project, it is essential to evaluate the specific project requirements, available resources, and intended learning outcomes. SCORM might be an overkill or a poor fit if the project is small-scale, requires a high degree of customization, needs to be rapidly deployed, or includes a significant amount of offline learning, among other reasons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as ‚Äúbeeping.‚Äù Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn‚Äôt ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn‚Äôt even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I‚Äôve been on them for a few years now, and it‚Äôs changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn‚Äôt guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I‚Äôm considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don‚Äôt like being behind the wheel), I don‚Äôt double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It‚Äôs the greatest gift I‚Äôve given to myself. You know yourself better than anyone, even if you feel like you don‚Äôt know yourself. If something feels wrong, don‚Äôt just live with it - keep pushing for a correct diagnosis!

As parasites , fungi live in or on other organisms and get their nutrients from their host. Parasitic fungi use enzymes to break down living tissue, which may causes illness in the host. Disease-causing fungi are parasitic. Recall that parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship between organisms of different species in which one, the parasite, benefits from a close association with the other, the host, which is harmed. and the situation: Two frogs are being examined in a laboratory. Frog X was found in a pond in the forest and has a parasite in it. Frog Y was found just outside the laboratory and is missing one eye. The employees at the lab weren't planning on analyzing any frogs, but when they found the one outside their front door they changed their mind. Answer the following question: Which frog is less likely to contract an illness? A:","completion":"Frog Y is less likely to contract an illness. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting the likelihood of contracting an illness in both frogs. For Frog X, it is mentioned that it has a parasite, which is a disease-causing fungi that can break down living tissue and potentially cause illness in the host. For Frog Y, there is no mention of any parasites or diseases affecting it, only that it is missing one eye. Step 2: Compare the factors affecting the likelihood of contracting an illness for both frogs. Frog X is already hosting a parasite, which can potentially cause illness. While Frog Y has an injury (missing eye), it is not directly related to contracting an illness through parasitic fungi. Step 3: Conclude which frog is less likely to contract an illness. Since Frog X already hosts a parasite that can potentially cause illness, and Frog Y doesn't show any signs of parasitic infection, Frog Y is considered less likely to contract an illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Place the phrases in the correct Turkish sentence structure: - In Turkish, the time phrase usually comes at the beginning of the sentence, so start with \\"Son iki ayda\\". - Then, follow with the subject \\"h√ºk√ºmet\\", as Turkish typically follows a subject-object-verb order. - The phrase \\"has been the target of attacks\\" is the main verb, which comes at the end of the sentence in Turkish. In this case, the verb phrase is \\"saldƒ±rƒ± hedefi olmu≈ütur\\". - \\"From the opposition\\" is a prepositional phrase showing the source of the action, so it should come before the verb phrase. In Turkish, this is \\"muhalefetten\\". - Finally, \\"on a number of fronts\\" is another prepositional phrase showing the scope of the action and it should also come before the verb phrase.

The game consists of a vertical board with five slotted dials on each side . Each player starts with ten numbered tokens or discs at the top of the board . The object of the game is to move the discs to the bottom of the board by turning the dials . Players alternate turns moving the dials and can not move a dial that their opponent has just moved . The winner is the first player to move all of their discs into the tray at the bottom . An advanced version of the rules dictates that the discs arrive in the tray in numerical order . Since neither player can see the other 's board , it is common to inadvertently advance the opponent 's disc . The game rewards forward thinking and planning ; players may try to \`\` trap '' their opponent into turning a dial that will advance their own disc , while trying to ensure that their own discs are not caught and dropped out of order . The game is currently available in the UK under the name New Downfall , manufactured and marketed by Hasbro .

Summarize this article: Historically, the vice-presidential debate is given scant media attention compared to the top-of-the-ticket showdowns. With one notable exception - Palin v Biden in 2008- the television audience is significantly smaller, as well. Chances are a showdown between two middle-age white men with Mid-Western roots isn't going to move the needle as far as national attention goes. For political junkies longing for a fix before Sunday's second presidential debate, however, the event can reveal the state of the two campaigns and what could be in store as the race heads into its final weeks. Here are four things to look for when the bottom of the ticket takes the stage in the small central Virginia town of Farmville at 21:00 EDT (02:00 BST) on Tuesday. Back in 2012, Barack Obama had a lacklustre first debate performance, putting rank-and-file Democrats into a state of near panic, as polls showed Republican Mitt Romney pulling into a dead heat. A week later, Vice-President Biden went up against Paul Ryan and gave the kind of aggressive, animated performance that rallied his partisan troops from their doom-and-gloom stupor. Mr Pence faces a similar situation on Tuesday night. While Hillary Clinton may not have delivered a knock-out blow to Donald Trump in New York last Monday, the Republican nominee has spent the last week punching himself in the face. Thanks to his feud with beauty pageant winner Alicia Machado, his early morning Twitter meltdown on Friday, the New York Times article on his 1995 tax returns and renewed questions about his charitable foundation, Mr Trump is in a slump. Mr Pence's task is to be this year's Biden and calm his party's frazzled nerves. The big question: Mr Pence needs to post a clean sheet in this debate and change the subject from Mr Trump's tumultuous week. Mr Kaine needs to keep the Clinton momentum rolling. Who can pull it off? One of the traditional roles for vice-presidential nominee is to serve as the campaign's attack dog - going after the opposition with a ferocity that would be unbecoming for the top-of-the-ticket candidate. Of course enthusiastic aggression hasn't been a problem for Mr Trump in the past, but after his debate Monday night, some of his supporters were left wishing their man had been more direct in his criticism of his opponent. Now's the chance for Mr Pence to go on the offensive. The problem for him, however, is he's not exactly the most adept rhetorical swordsman. While someone like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie would have joyfully tried to demolish Mrs Clinton, Mr Pence's Mid-Western reticence may make him ill-suited for the task. Where he does decide to strike could preview the areas the Trump campaign plans to focus on in the campaign's final weeks, however. Will it be on personal issues? The Clinton Foundation? Economic policy? Mr Kaine isn't much of a bomb-thrower either. His past attacks on Mr Trump have been more along the lines of awkward-dad humour than outright belligerence. He's been given plenty of material to work with over the past week, but his challenge will be to find the best way to draw blood. Mr Trump's taxes are an obvious target that's much in the news, but rehashing his questionable behaviour toward women may prove to hold more electoral opportunity. The big question: Which mild-mannered politician can find his inner mean streak? Google the words \\"Mike Pence defends\\", and the nearly half a million hits will reveal the size of the task confronting the Republican vice-presidential nominee. He's been called on to run interference for Mr Trump on taxes, immigration, Vladimir Putin, Donald Jr's Skittles tweet ... just about every bit of controversial news coming out of his team's campaign since he joined the ticket. Playing Donald Trump's straight man is a thankless job made all the more difficult because Mr Pence is a conventional politician expected to behave in conventional ways. While the New York real estate mogul has been singularly adept at shrugging off criticism, Mr Pence - who wants to stay electorally viable - is more constrained by political norms. Mr Kaine will have his own challenges, although they're of the more traditional variety. He could have to explain his candidate's shifting stance on global trade deals - such as backing away from support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership - even though he has praised trade deals in the past. And he will almost certainly be pressed on Mrs Clinton's email controversy and conflict-of-interest allegations involving the Clinton Foundation. The big question: Mr Kaine won't get off easy, but has any vice-presidential nominee faced a more extraordinary challenge than Mike Pence? All the focus will be on Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump, but that doesn't mean the two vice-presidential candidates can completely avoid questions about their own records. They may lob a few attacks each other's way, if only to throw their opponent off balance. The Republicans are already telegraphing a possible attack against Mr Kaine's past with a web video criticising him for representing death-row inmates convicted of violent offences. The Democrat also may be forced to answer for gifts he accepted from lobbyists while he was governor of Virginia. Mr Pence also has some potential vulnerabilities. As Indiana governor he became mired in the controversy surrounding his state's law allowing businesses to discriminate against gay customers. He also wrote a newspaper column and hosted a talk-radio show in the 1990s that could provide fodder for Mr Kaine. For instance, he called climate change a myth and said tobacco smoking \\"doesn't kill\\". The last thing a participant in a vice-presidential debate wants to do is to become the story because it's almost never good news. Dan Quayle made headlines for all the wrong reasons in his 1988 debate, when he blundered headlong into Lloyd Bentsen's \\"you're no Jack Kennedy\\" takedown. The good news for Mr Quayle, of course, is that even that historic humiliation didn't prevent his ticket from winning the White House. The big question: Could either candidate mess up so badly that his moment in the spotlight lives on past this election? 49% Hillary Clinton 45% Donald Trump Please enable Javascript to view our poll of polls chart. Last updated October 3, 2016 The BBC poll of polls looks at the five most recent national polls and takes the median value, ie, the value between the two figures that are higher and two figures that are lower. Summary:","completion":"The Vice-presidential debate usually gets less attention than the main debates between the two Presidential candidates, but it can reveal important things about each campaign. The debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine will happen in a small town in Virginia. Pence needs to do well in the debate to change the discussion from Trump's recent troubles, while Kaine needs to keep Clinton's momentum going. Traditionally, Vice Presidents are the \\"attack dogs\\" of the campaign, so they will likely be more aggressive than their Presidential counterparts. Finally, they may be asked about their own political records, which could lead to some interesting moments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I don't know why Sony put this on SACD. The instrumental fidelity is nonexistent and there's no sound stage. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the detailed content of the review provided, it can be inferred that the user would not recommend this product. This conclusion is reached after considering several negative points raised by the user in the review. The user states initially that the SACD of Schubert's 9th symphony is one of the worst recordings they have ever heard. This statement indicates profound dissatisfaction with the product. Further on, the reviewer pinpoints specific aspects they found unsatisfactory. They question why Sony opted to use SACD for this recording, implying that they believe the format may not have been suitable or didn't meet their expectations in preserving the quality of the symphony's recording. It's obvious that the user expected more from a reputable company such as Sony, and their disappointment is clearly expressed here. The user also mentions that the 'instrumental fidelity is nonexistent'. Instrumental fidelity refers to the accuracy of the musical instruments' sounds in the recording. The fact that the user finds this aspect nonexistent further emphasizes their dissatisfaction because fidelity is an important factor for any music recording, impacting the overall listening experience. Lastly, the user criticizes the absence of a sound stage, another essential element in a recording. A sound stage helps give a recording depth and spatial qualities, allowing listeners to discern individual instruments' positions as if they were at a live performance, and its absence can flatten the sound and rob the music of its vibrancy and life. To summarize, all these negative points unequivocally suggest that the user is deeply dissatisfied with the product. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that they would recommend the SACD of Schubert's 9th symphony to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Peter DaSilva/Special to The Chronicle) Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf glances over to Oakland Police Officer Hookfin as she exits a meeting room followed by City Administrator Sabrina Landreth who was recently appointmented to over see the Oakland State backtracks, says Oakland can go without acting police chief After a day of confusion, state officials backed down late Monday on an assertion that Mayor Libby Schaaf‚Äôs plan to have the Oakland Police Department function without an acting police chief violated California law. Officials at the state Police Officers Standards and Training agency, or POST, had said earlier Monday that Oakland‚Äôs plan to have police commanders report to City Administrator Sabrina Landreth was illegal. They cited both California government code and a state attorney general‚Äôs opinion backing their argument that the city needed to name an acting chief to head the department, which is embroiled in multiple scandals and has gone through three chiefs in less than two weeks. Acting Assistant Chief David Downing is in charge of day-to-day decisions for the Police Department, Schaaf‚Äôs office said, while Landreth is overseeing administrative and personnel decisions. Late Monday, POST conceded it had made its argument before the city attorney‚Äôs office cited more recent federal case law, from 2011, exempting charter cities such as Oakland from the requirement. Ralph Brown, a spokesman for POST, confirmed that it appeared Oakland was correct after all in determining that, as a charter city, it was exempt from state law requiring general law cities to name an acting police chief. According to the 2011 case law, charter cities have the authority ‚Äúto constitute, regulate and govern police departments‚Äù ‚Äî meaning Landreth can run Oakland‚Äôs police administrative and personnel matters. ‚ÄúActing Assistant Chief of Police David Downing is the highest-ranking member of the Police Department and is the City‚Äôs POST designee in charge of tactical and operational matters,‚Äù mayoral spokeswoman Erica Terry Derryck said in a statement late Monday. Schaaf had said Friday that police commanders would be reporting to Landreth. At the same time, she said Assistant Chief Paul Figueroa, whom she had installed as acting chief just two days before, had backed out of the job, gone on leave and said he wanted to return to the force as a captain. The mayor wouldn‚Äôt explain Figueroa‚Äôs decision but said it had nothing to do with a scandal in which several officers are under suspicion of having sex with a teen sex worker, in some cases when she was still underage. She also said Figueroa wasn‚Äôt connected to another investigation, this one involving racist text messages that Schaaf says several African American officers sent. Separately, an Oakland homicide cop is under investigation for allegedly having his then-girlfriend help him write his reports. The sex scandal resulted in Chief Sean Whent‚Äôs resignation June 9. His interim replacement, BART Assistant Police Chief Ben Fairow, was fired Wednesday. Schaaf wouldn‚Äôt say why, but his old boss at BART, Police Chief Kenton Rainey, said Fairow had admitted to an extramarital affair more than a decade earlier, when he worked for the Oakland Police Department.

It is bounded to the north by Loch Scridain and to the south by the Firth of Lorne. The main villages are Bunessan and Fionnphort, with smaller settlements including Ardtun, Camas, Carsaig, Knockan, Pennyghael and Uisken. Knocknafenaig, Suidhe, and Shiaba are three of the many cleared settlements on the Ross. - Fionnphort ( English pronunciation : / fnfrt / , Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : ( fjunafrt ) ) is the principal port of the Ross of Mull , and the second largest settlement in the area ( its population is approximately 80 ) . The village 's name is the anglicised pronunciation of the gaelic for \`\` White Port '' and previous names have included Coal Idhe , gaelic for \`\` Sound of Iona '' . - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Bunessan is a small village on the Ross of Mull in the south-west of the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - Saint Columba ('church dove'; 7 December 521 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of D√°l Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. - Iona is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for four centuries and is today renowned for its tranquility and natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination and a place for retreats. Its modern Gaelic name means \\"Iona of (Saint) Columba\\" (formerly anglicised \\"Icolmkill\\"). - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - Uisken (meaning \\"water-bay\\") is a settlement on a sandy bay on the Ross of Mull in the south of the Isle of Mull, on the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon. - Ardtun is a settlement on the Isle of Mull, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. Ardtun is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon. - Knocknafenaig is a ruined township on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. - In economics, cargo or freight are goods or produce being conveyed generally for commercial gain by ship, boat, or aircraft, although the term is now often extended to cover all types of freight, including that carried by train, van, truck, or intermodal container. The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facility. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Knockan is a township of six crofts in the community of Ardtun, in the south of the island of Mull off the west coast of Scotland. - A harbor or harbour (see spelling differences), or haven, is a body of water where ships, boats and barges seek shelter from stormy weather, or are stored for future use. Harbors and ports are often confused with each other. A port is a manmade facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers. Ports are often located \\"in\\" harbors. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Su√∞reyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.

Then take a glance across the Channel, where a tumbling euro and plunging property prices mean it‚Äôs now more affordable than ever to pick up your own French chateau. The prices of some fairytale French mansions have halved since 2007, with some as cheap as ¬£270,000 - the average cost of a British home. One French estate agency this week reported that it had 136 rambling piles for sale, each costing ¬£500,000 or less. So if you‚Äôre dreaming of joining the lucky few whose homes boast vast rooms, gables, turrets, towers and moats, here are ten of the most affordable piles on the market in La Belle France. Maison Saint-James. Saint-James, Normandy. The Spec: 3,000 sq ft; 11 bedrooms; third of an acre. A restored chateau, it was built on the foundations of a 200-year-old house which was destroyed by Allied bombing during the war. Until recently it was used as holiday accommodation and remains in good condition. West-facing, it‚Äôs great for sunsets, and is located less than 20 miles from the fabled Mont St Michel Abbey, one of the most visited cultural sites in France. Saint-James is a charming village where William the Conqueror built a fort in 1067 and spent happy days with his wife, Matilda of Flanders, and some of their nine children. A separate guest studio, located nearby in the grounds of the maison could be rented out. AGENT: French Entr√©e, www.frenchentree.com. Jardin de Cure. Totes, Normandy. The Spec: 4,500 sq ft; 13 bedrooms; five acres. Set in a beautiful park with ancient chestnut trees and a walled cottage garden, this 19th century stately home has been in the same family for the past 50 years and boasts oak parquet floors and high ceilings with ornate plasterwork in many of the reception rooms. The property comes with a large outbuilding at the park entrance, which could be sold as a separate home, and is just a stroll from the village, while Normandy‚Äôs beautiful beaches are just 30 minutes‚Äô drive away. Much admired by villagers, the chateau was previously owned by the Mayor, but has since belonged to a French grandmother who raised her family there and feels it‚Äôs too big for her to manage. AGENT: Leggett Prestige www.leggettprestige.com. Chateau Sable Sur Sarthe. Mayenne, Loire. The Spec: 4,305 sq ft; 11 bedrooms; seven acres. Listed as a historic monument, this early 17th century chateau comes with its own moat and sweeping driveway. At this price, a full renovation is required, but there is a wealth of original features to work with, from limestone fireplaces to 19th century tiles, not to mention the vast 516 sq ft dining room. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure www.groupe-mercure.com. Manoir Puy de Dome. Vall ee de la Sioule, Auvergne. The Spec: 2,475 sq ft; seven bedrooms; three quarters of an acre. This traditional chateau dates back to 1830, the year in which the conservative government of Charles X was overthrown by Louis Philippe I in what became known as the July Revolution. There are high ceilings, marble fireplaces and a beautiful stone staircase to give you a sense of grand living. With a library, orangery, music room and four generously proportioned bathrooms, this has real Downton Abbey appeal. Outside there are two garages and a stable. The large walled courtyard garden has potential to be turned into a rather grand Versailles style affair, complete with fountains and topiary. AGENT: Proprieties de France www.proprietiesdefrance.com. Chateau Giat, ¬£318,466. Auvergne. The Spec: Nine bedrooms and four bathrooms set in 0.7 acres of land. This beautiful chateau is reached via a gravelled drive through wrought iron gates to give it that Brideshead feel. To the rear is a beautiful lawned garden with a swimming pool, while despite the privacy afforded by the walled garden the property lies close to a pretty market town. AGENT: Leggett Immoblier www.frenchestateagents.com. Chateau de Niort. Niort: Poitou-Charentes. The Spec: 3,443 sq ft; seven bedrooms; half an acre. Built in 1880 but fully renovated, this rather splendid home is being run as a b&b, with plenty of future bookings. Should you choose to take over the business, you don‚Äôt even have to see much of your guests, as they have a separate guest lounge and two bedrooms in one wing. Not a vast amount of land, but the gardens are pretty and the chateau is less than a mile from the nearest small town. AGENT: Prestige property www.prestigeproperty.co.uk. Chateau Figeac. Figeac, La Lot. The Spec: 7,319 sq ft; six bedrooms; two-and-a-half acres of tree-lined grounds. If you like history then this is the place for you, as it‚Äôs a patchwork affair with 12th century foundations and two wings built in the 17th and 19th century respectively. The 17th century tower has a 376 sq ft salon complete with balcony, should you wish to host a string quartet to entertain your guests. Fully restored aside from one tower, there is, alas, no central heating for those chilly winter nights, although there are fireplaces aplenty. The pretty grounds have small outbuildings which also have potential for development. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure. Manoir Rethel. Champagne, Ardenne. The Spec: 5,274 sq ft; three bedrooms; 4.7 acres. A fortress built in 1659, the castle has been given listed status as its four ancient towers, in the shape of waterdrops, were deemed so unusual. The roof has been fully restored, but if you‚Äôre dismayed by the lowly number of bedrooms, a third of the house remains unrenovated, so you could always create more. The living room has a vast fireplace and separate salon. It‚Äôs also just 30 minutes from Epernay, heart of the champagne region of Reims. AGENT: Groupe Mercure. Chateau Picardie. Abbeville, Picardie. The Spec: 5,274 sq ft; nine bedrooms; ten acres. Built in 1850, this beautiful 19th century chateau has remained in the same family ever since ‚Äî that‚Äôs 165 years. It retains all its original features, from wood floors to marble fireplaces, but requires a bit of TLC. Outside, the gardens/woodland are filled with ancient oak and beech trees once used as hideouts by German soldiers during the war. A Chaussee Brunehaut, the French name for an ancient Roman road through the region and said to have been used by Julius Caesar, passes nearby the chateau, which lies 12 miles from the historic town of Abbeville. The fact that it‚Äôs only 80 miles from Calais makes it a plausible weekend getaway destination. AGENT: Leggett Prestige. Chateau Allier. Allier, Auvergne. The Spec: 6,458 sq ft; seven bedrooms; 14 acres. This 19th century chateau has the fairytale factor, with Disney-style turrets. The ground floor features a 300 sq ft south-facing terrace with stunning views over the Puy mountains. It‚Äôs habitable and retains a lot of traditional features, from parquet floor to carved woodwork. A sweeping set of steps from the front door lead to your land, comprising beautiful meadows and woods bordering a river. AGENT: Groupe-Mercure.

Question: They began moving car with their bare hands to save the child trapped underneath, nobody could explain where they got the what to do so? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - strength - energy - force - drive - mood Answer:","completion":"strength Step 1: Analyzing the given options In this step, I analyze all the available options to see which one is the most suitable for answering the question. Step 2: Evaluating the context of the question The question's context is that people are trying to save a child trapped under a car, so the option should be related to the effort or ability required to move a car. Step 3: Matching the options to the context Strength, energy, force, and drive can all be related to physical effort; however, strength is the most suitable since it directly describes the physical power needed to move a car. Step 4: Eliminating irrelevant options Mood is not related to physical effort or ability, so it can be eliminated as an option. Step 5: Choosing the most suitable option Based on the evaluation of the context and the options, the most suitable option to answer the question is 'strength.'
