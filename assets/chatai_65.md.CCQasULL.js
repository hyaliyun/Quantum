Since it's a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the unknown leg: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse. We are given a = 8 cm and c = 17 cm. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: 8^2 + b^2 = 17^2 64 + b^2 = 289 Now, we can solve for b^2: b^2 = 289 - 64 b^2 = 225 Taking the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg: b = √225 b = 15 cm So, the length of the other leg is 15 cm."},{"prompt":"A right triangle has one leg measuring 6 cm and the hypotenuse measuring 10 cm. What is the length of the other leg of the triangle?","completion":"We can use the Pythagorean theorem to solve this problem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs). In this case, let's call the length of the unknown leg \\"b\\". The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a and b are the lengths of the legs, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. We are given the length of one leg (a = 6 cm) and the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm). We can plug these values into the formula and solve for the length of the other leg (b): 6^2 + b^2 = 10^2 36 + b^2 = 100 Now, we can subtract 36 from both sides of the equation to isolate b^2: b^2 = 64 Finally, we can take the square root of both sides to find the length of the other leg (b): b = √64 b = 8 cm So, the length of the other leg of the triangle is 8 cm."},{"prompt":"A parallelogram has a base of 6 meters and a height of 10 meters.

For y1: sin(x) = (3 + √17) / 4 x = arcsin((3 + √17) / 4) However, (3 + √17) / 4 is greater than 1, which is not possible for sin(x). Therefore, there is no solution for x in this case. For y2: sin(x) = (3 - √17) / 4 x = arcsin((3 - √17) / 4) Since (3 - √17) / 4 is within the range of -1 to 1, we can find the value of x: x ≈ arcsin((3 - √17) / 4) ≈ 0.65 radians But we also need to consider the other angle in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π that has the same sine value. This angle can be found by subtracting the first angle from π: x2 = π - x1 ≈ π - 0.65 ≈ 2.49 radians So, the two solutions for x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π are: x ≈ 0.65 radians and x ≈ 2.49 radians."},{"prompt":"What are the solutions for the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π)?","completion":"To find the solutions for the equation sin(x) = 1/2 in the interval [0, 2π), we need to find the angles x for which the sine function equals 1/2. We know that sin(π/6) = 1/2 and sin(5π/6) = 1/2. These are the two angles in the interval [0, 2π) that have a sine value of 1/2.
