According to the Commission, Google prevented third-party websites from displaying ads from rival search engines, further cementing the company's dominance in the online advertising market. The fine amounted to €1.49 billion (1.7 billion), making it the third time in as many years that Google has been hit with a major antitrust penalty from the EU. The Commission determined that Google's AdSense policies were in violation of EU antitrust rules, which prohibit companies from using their dominant market position to stifle competition. Google required third-party websites to enter into exclusive contracts that prohibited them from displaying ads from rival search engines. The Commission found that these contracts were particularly harmful to smaller websites that relied on Google's AdSense program to generate revenue. This latest fine follows a €4.34 billion (5 billion) penalty that the European Commission imposed on Google last year for anti-competitive behavior related to the Android operating system. In 2017, Google was also fined €2.4 billion (2.7 billion) for giving its own shopping comparison service an illegal advantage over those of competitors. Google has responded to the latest fine by stating that it has made changes to its AdSense policies in response to concerns raised by the European Commission. The company will no longer include the exclusivity clauses in its AdSense contracts, although it will still retain the right to review websites that participate in the program. Google has also said that it will appeal the decision to impose the €1.49 billion fine. The European Commission's ongoing scrutiny of Google's business practices reflects broader concerns about the power of major tech companies and their ability to control the digital economy. While Google has argued that the fines are unwarranted and could harm innovation, the Commission has insisted that anti-competitive behavior must be addressed in order to ensure a level playing field for all actors in the market. The AdSense fines mark another chapter in the ongoing battle between regulators and tech giants, and raise important questions about the future of competition in the digital age."},{"prompt":"Amy was feeling exhausted after a long day at work.

(CNN) President Obama has ordered the deployment of up to 450 additional troops to Iraq in a campaign against ISIS, increasing the U.S. troop presence there to just over 3,500. This marks a significant change in the administration's strategy, which had previously been limited to airstrikes and support for local ground forces, and signals the White House's mounting alarm over the progress of ISIS in Iraq. Administration officials, however, are intent on making sure the new deployment doesn't violate Obama's pledge against American boots on the ground in Iraq. This is an additive contribution to our effort to build up Iraqi security forces to combat ISIL, Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, told reporters Friday. It is not a new component of our strategy. The troops will advise and assist Iraqi forces, and will not engage in combat missions. Obama says the decision to deploy additional troops comes after a request from the Iraqi government, which has struggled to hold off ISIS militants. It is part of a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in Iraq, as @placeholder indicates. @highlight 450 additional troops to be deployed to Iraq @highlight U.S. deployment increasing to just over 3,500 troops. @highlight Troops will advise and assist Iraqi forces and will not engage in combat missions.

The organization cites the recent spread of the virus to Goma, a city of nearly two million people near the border with Rwanda, as the reason for the emergency declaration. More than 2,500 cases of Ebola have been reported so far, with over 1,700 deaths. The organization will work to contain the spread of the virus and provide treatment to those who need it. What do you think is the most effective way to manage and counteract the spread of Ebola?","completion":"On July 17th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a global health emergency. This decision came after reports of the virus spreading to Goma, a populous city located near the Rwandan border. The outbreak has already infected over 2,500 people, causing more than 1,700 deaths. WHO officials are adamant that immediate action is crucial to prevent further spread. Goma is a significant transportation hub, with a high flow of travelers moving in and out of the city, making it an area of high risk for disease spread. As such, there is a high potential for the virus to reach other densely populated areas of the region if proper measures are not taken. \\"The spread of the virus to Goma could be a gamechanger, with potentially severe consequences,\\" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO. To prevent further spread of the virus, WHO and other health organizations are working to contain and treat patients infected with Ebola in Goma. Officials are screening people for the virus at all entry points and working to identify potential carriers. WHO is also establishing treatment centers to provide care for those who have been infected. The organization has also stated that more funds are needed to combat the outbreak. So far, WHO has only received half of the 98 million needed to tackle the virus effectively. \\"We cannot defeat Ebola without the resources we need,\\" Ghebreyesus said. The declaration of a global health emergency is expected to mobilize more funding, which could aid in the successful management of the outbreak. The emergency declaration will also improve coordination between international and local efforts, as it pushes countries to work together to address the crisis. In conclusion, the recent spread of the Ebola virus to Goma has prompted the WHO to declare this outbreak as a global health emergency. With the establishment of treatment centers, intensified screening efforts, and increased funding, WHO hopes to contain the virus's spread and prevent further infections."},{"prompt":"Given the list of concepts: phone, message, friend; Generate a sentence with all the concepts","completion":"I sent a message to my friend via phone."},{"prompt":"Title: Disappointing Sequel Review: I loved the first book in this series, but unfortunately, the sequel was a huge letdown.
