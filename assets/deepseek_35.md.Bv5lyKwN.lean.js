As each new DNA strand is synthesized, it is checked for errors by specialized enzymes that proofread the sequence. 5.

Once the entire DNA molecule has been replicated, the primers are removed by another enzyme called RNase H, and replaced with DNA. 7.

The spindle fibers from the centrioles attach to the chromosomes at their centromeres. - In anaphase, the spindle fibers start to pull the sister chromatids of each chromosome apart, and towards opposite poles of the cell. - In telophase, two new nuclei form, around the chromosomes at opposite ends of the cell. The chromosomes begin to unwind back into chromatin, and the spindle fibers disintegrate.

The approval comes after the European Medicines Agency determined that the vaccine was safe and effective. The EU has ordered 300 million doses of the vaccine, which will be distributed among its member states.","completion":"The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has received approval from the European Union. This comes after the European Medicines Agency extensively reviewed the vaccine's safety and efficacy results. The vaccine has been shown to be highly effective, with a reported efficacy of 95%, potentially leading to a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Europe. One of the notable points about the approval of the vaccine in Europe is the size of the order placed. The EU has ordered a total of 300 million doses of the vaccine, which will be distributed among the member states. This significant order is part of the EU's efforts to vaccinate its population as efficiently and quickly as possible. The distribution of the vaccine will be a massive logistical challenge, primarily due to the requirement for the vaccine to be stored at extremely low temperatures. The vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, posing a significant challenge for many European nations' healthcare systems. The European Union has been lobbying for a unified approach to the distribution and administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, suggesting that the EU member states distribute the vaccine based on population size. The method would ensure that herd immunity is reached across Europe, and no country would receive a disproportionate number of doses. The approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Europe could be pivotal in the fight against COVID-19, given the vaccine's high efficacy rate. If the vaccine is distributed correctly and efficiently, Europe could see a significant reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths throughout 2021."},{"prompt":"Choose the most likely explanation based on the presented information.

However, you need to provide me with more details or specific context to better tailor the article to your needs. --- Controversy Surrounds Proposed New Development in Historic Neighborhood Residents of a historic neighborhood are up in arms over a proposed new development that could significantly alter the character of their community. The development, which would be constructed on a large plot of land in the heart of the neighborhood, has sparked heated debate among residents, city officials, and developers. Supporters of the project argue that it would create much-needed housing, generate jobs, and increase property values. Opponents say it would lead to overdevelopment, traffic congestion, and the destruction of the neighborhood's historic buildings. The neighborhood, which is known for its picturesque streetscapes and well-preserved Victorian homes, has long been a favorite of residents and visitors alike. However, as the city has grown, demand for housing has increased, and developers have eyed the area as a prime location for new construction. The proposed development, which would include a mix of residential units, retail space, and office space, came as a surprise to many residents who had assumed the neighborhood was protected by zoning laws. Opponents of the development have taken to social media to voice their concerns, organizing protests and rallies to demonstrate their opposition. They argue that the project is too big and would overwhelm the neighborhood's infrastructure, including its narrow streets and limited parking. They also worry that it would change the character of the area, making it less attractive to those who cherish its historic charm. Supporters of the project, including the developers and some city officials, argue that the project is necessary to meet the city's growing housing needs. They say that the project would bring much-needed new housing to the area, including affordable units for low-income residents. They also argue that the development would create new jobs and boost the local economy. Additionally, they point out that the proposed development had passed all of the necessary environmental and permitting requirements and is in compliance with local zoning laws. The debate over the proposed development shows no signs of slowing down, with both sides digging in their heels and refusing to back down. City officials are caught in the middle, balancing the needs of residents with the demands of developers and the realities of a growing city. Ultimately, the future of the neighborhood will depend on the outcome of this contentious battle, and the ability of all parties involved to find a compromise that satisfies everyone's needs."},{"prompt":"Travis and Tyler went on a trip, but they got lost on the way.

The country had already been grappling with widespread corruption and state capture allegations prior to the global health crisis. However, the pandemic has exposed the extent of corruption within the government procurement process. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has acknowledged the negative impact of corruption on the country's development and has reiterated his commitment to take action against it. In August 2020, he launched an anti-corruption unit to investigate allegations of corruption related to COVID-19 relief funds. In October 2020, a report was released by the Auditor General of South Africa, which revealed irregularities in the procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) worth R10.2 billion (684 million) by government departments and entities. This caused public outrage as it demonstrated how corrupt officials were taking advantage of the pandemic to enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers. The government has since taken steps towards addressing the issue of corruption. In February 2021, President Ramaphosa signed the Public Procurement Bill into law, which aims to promote transparency and accountability in the procurement process. The bill also establishes a central procurement authority to oversee procurement processes across all government departments. However, there are still challenges facing the fight against corruption. Critics argue that there is a lack of political will to hold corrupt officials accountable, and that the judiciary system is not equipped to handle corruption cases effectively. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed immense pressure on the country's resources, making it more difficult to prioritize the fight against corruption. Despite these challenges, South Africa must continue to combat corruption in order to promote economic growth and development, and to restore public trust in the government. The country has made progress in its battle against corruption, but more work needs to be done to ensure that corrupt officials will be held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.
