The lawsuit, filed in California, claims that the driver, Garrett Wilhelm, was using FaceTime when he crashed into the car carrying James and Bethany Modisette and their two daughters. The Modisettes' car was stopped on a highway near Dallas when Wilhelm's Toyota 4Runner slammed into the family's vehicle at 65 mph. The accident killed 5yearold Moriah Modisette and seriously injured her sister, Isabella, and their parents. Wilhelm was charged with manslaughter after investigators found that he was using FaceTime at the time of the crash. The lawsuit claims that Apple was aware of the app's potential for distraction, but did not implement safeguards to prevent it from being used while driving.","completion":"A family that lost their daughter in a fatal car accident in Texas in 2016 is suing Apple, blaming the company's FaceTime app for the tragedy. James and Bethany Modisette and their two daughters, Moriah and Isabella, were hit by a speeding Toyota 4Runner driven by Garrett Wilhelm while they were stopped on a highway near Dallas. Moriah, who was five at the time, died on her way to the hospital, and her parents and sister suffered serious injuries. The lawsuit claims that Wilhelm was using FaceTime at the time of the crash and that the app distracted him from paying attention to the road. According to court documents, the Modisettes' legal team alleges that Apple knew of the potential for its app to be a distraction for drivers but failed to take the necessary steps to prevent it from being used while driving. The lawsuit also accuses the technology giant of promoting the app as safe for motorists despite knowing that it posed a danger. Wilhelm was charged with manslaughter after investigators found that he was using FaceTime when the accident occurred. The lawsuit claims that Wilhelm was \\"specifically using the FaceTime application at the time of the collision and continued to use it for an extended period after impact, causing him to be distracted and/or lose focus on the roadway.\\" Wilhelm pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to six years in prison. The case against Apple, which was filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, seeks damages and compensation for the family's loss. The suit alleges that Apple was aware of the serious risks posed by FaceTime and other similar apps and that it had the technology to disable the app while driving but chose not to implement it. The Modisettes' lawyers claim that Apple has a responsibility to ensure the safety of all users and that it should be held accountable for any harm caused by its products. This lawsuit is not the first to be filed against Apple over its FaceTime app. In a similar case in Texas, a woman sued the company claiming that the app caused the death of her 5-year-old daughter, who was a passenger in a car that was hit by a driver using the app. Apple settled that case out of court for an undisclosed sum. The Modisettes' case is being closely watched by legal experts who believe that it could set a precedent for future lawsuits against tech companies over distracted driving accidents. With more and more people using their smartphones while driving, advocates are calling on lawmakers and technology companies to do more to prevent such accidents and improve road safety."},{"prompt":"Sum up the following dialogue: Sarah: Hey, have you seen my phone?

The Trump administration has vowed to challenge the decision.","completion":"Federal Judge in Hawaii Blocks President Trump’s Executive Immigration Order Indefinitely President Trump’s controversial executive order that banned refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States has been temporarily suspended by a federal judge in Hawaii. The ruling came just hours before the ban was due to go into effect. US District Judge Derrick Watson issued a nationwide temporary restraining order on Wednesday evening, blocking the enforcement of the ban—a move that comes as a significant blow to President Trump’s administration. Judge Watson, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, found that Hawaii has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success in challenging the constitutionality of the order, which targets Muslims based on their religion. According to Watson, the harm indicated by the State of Hawaii and its residents is “significant and irreparable.” He stated that Trump’s order discriminates against individuals based on their nationality, thereby violating the US constitution. In his ruling, Watson rejected the government's argument that the ban was necessary for national security reasons, pointing out that the administration had failed to provide evidence that the “national security” concerns it had put forward were directly tied to travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries listed in the order. The decision in Hawaii, which applies nationwide, is a significant legal setback for Trump's executive order regarding immigration, which has caused widespread chaos, protests, and criticism across the US and the world. The Trump administration had earlier announced that it will appeal the ruling and continue to fight the decision. The Justice Department called the order \\"flawed both in reasoning and in scope.\\" President Trump reacted to the decision during a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, where he vowed to fight the ruling, stating that his administration will take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary.

The cancellation of Friday Prayers, a weekly event where thousands of people gather to pray and listen to sermons, is a significant step for Iran, which has been grappling with the outbreak since February. According to reports from Tehran, the decision was made after officials announced the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in a single day since the pandemic began. The country has recorded over 200,000 coronavirus cases and 9,392 deaths thus far, with the number of cases continuing to rise. Iran has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the Middle East, and the government has taken several measures to curb the spread of the virus. These measures include the closure of schools, universities, and many public spaces. Similar measures have been taken across other countries experiencing the virus outbreak, with many religious organizations and events being restricted or canceled outright. In Saudi Arabia, the Hajj, a ritual pilgrimage to Mecca that attracts more than two million Muslims from around the world, has been dramatically scaled down this year. Only a few thousand people living in Saudi Arabia will be allowed to participate, and they will need to follow strict health and safety protocols. In India, the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival that attracts millions of people to the banks of the Ganges River, has been postponed indefinitely. Religious leaders around the world have been grappling with how to continue to provide spiritual guidance and support to their communities while also keeping them safe. Many have turned to virtual services and online platforms to connect with their followers, but this has not been possible for everyone. The cancellation of Friday Prayers in Iran is a reminder of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on religious practices and communities around the world. While necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, these measures have also had a profound impact on people's lives and well-being."},{"prompt":"w to repair a leaky faucet?

The researchers found that those who ate chocolate regularly had a lower BMI (body mass index) than those who did not. The study's lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano, explained that the key to chocolate's weight loss benefits lies in a compound called catechins. Catechins are a type of antioxidant that can increase metabolism and fat burning. Dark chocolate in particular contains high levels of catechins. Of course, this does not mean that people should go out and consume large amounts of chocolate. The study suggests that eating small portions of dark chocolate a few times a week can aid in weight loss efforts. However, individuals should still watch their overall calorie intake and exercise regularly. The study's findings have surprised many in the health and wellness industry, as chocolate has typically been viewed as a treat to be avoided when trying to lose weight.

Meet Jake, a young musician who dreams of making it big in the music industry. He spends his days in small gigs, coffee shops, and local bars, playing his heart out with a guitar in hand. Despite his talent, Jake hasn't had much luck in making a breakthrough in the industry. He struggles to pay the rent and often goes to bed on an empty stomach. Then there's Maria, a single mother who juggles between her job as a nurse and taking care of her sick child, Luis. Luis is diagnosed with leukemia and requires constant medical attention. Maria works tirelessly to provide for her child's medical bills but often falls short. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, lives a famous actor named John. John has a luxurious lifestyle, a massive fan following, and all the comforts money can buy. However, fame comes at a cost, and John finds himself lonely and disconnected from the real world. Lastly, there's retired police detective, Thomas. After years of working in the force, he finds himself struggling to cope with retirement.

This news comes at a crucial time as U.S. lawmakers are currently deliberating over new legislation that would offer greater legal safeguards for employees who report corporate misconduct. The proposed bill would strengthen existing whistleblower protections and provide more expansive relief to individuals who experience retaliation for speaking out. According to the report, workers across all industries and political affiliations agree that whistleblowers should be legally protected from retaliation. The overwhelming support for whistleblowers is likely due to the awareness raised by a number of high-profile cases, such as former NSA contractor Edward Snowden's disclosure of classified information and the numerous allegations against President Donald Trump. The report suggests that stronger whistleblower protections are necessary to encourage whistleblowers to come forward, and more importantly, to prevent hostile work environments that discourage workers from speaking out. In recent years, statistics have shown that retaliation against whistleblowers is increasing, with many employees facing unfair termination, demotion, or other forms of harassment. The National Whistleblower Center has been advocating for stronger whistleblower protections for years, and this new report underscores the need for urgent action. The organization hopes that Congress will take note of the report's findings and move swiftly to pass the proposed legislation, offering greater protections for whistleblowers, and fostering a more transparent and accountable workplace culture across the United States."},{"prompt":"Scientists Discover New Species of Spider in the Amazon Rainfore","completion":"New species of spider discovered in Amazon rainforest."},{"prompt":"Do you think the right answer to the question what is the primary source of energy for all living organisms on Earth? is fossil fuels, given that sunlight is the primary source of energy for all living organisms on Earth?","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"fossil fuels\\".
