Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Francis Albert Sinatra was born on December 12, 1915, in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. He was the only child of Italian immigrants Antonino Martino \\"Marty\\" Sinatra and Natalina \\"Dolly\\" Garaventa. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his ear drum, damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. Context: Sinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s. While films appealed to him, being exceptionally self-confident, he was rarely enthusiastic towards his own acting, once remarking that \\"pictures stink\\". Sinatra made his film debut in 1941, performing in an uncredited sequence in Las Vegas Nights, singing \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\" with Tommy Dorsey's The Pied Pipers. In 1943 he had a cameo role along with Duke Ellington and Count Basie in Charles Barton's Reveille with Beverly, making a brief appearance singing \\"Night and Day\\". The following year he was given his leading roles in Higher and Higher and Step Lively for RKO Pictures. In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra opposite Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors Aweigh, in which he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily\\", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared at the end of Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, in which he sang \\"Ol' Man River. In 1949, Sinatra co-starred with Gene Kelly in the Technicolor musical Take Me Out to the Ball Game, a film set in 1908, in which Sinatra and Kelly play baseball players who are part-time vaudevillians. He teamed up with Kelly for a third time in On the Town, playing a sailor on leave in New York City. Today the film is rated very highly by critics, and in 2006 it ranked No. 19 on the American Film Institute's list of best musicals. Both Double Dynamite (1951), an RKO Irving Cummings comedy produced by Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pevney's Meet Danny Wilson (1952) failed to make an impression. The New York World Telegram and Sun ran the headline \\"Gone on Frankie in '42; Gone in '52\\". Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity deals with the tribulations of three soldiers, played by Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, and Sinatra, stationed on Hawaii in the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sinatra had long been desperate to find a film role which would bring him back into the spotlight, and Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn had been inundated by appeals from people across Hollywood to give Sinatra a chance to star as \\"Maggio\\" in the film. During production, Montgomery Clift became a close friend, and Sinatra later professed that he \\"learned more about acting from him than anybody I ever knew before\\". After several years of critical and commercial decline, his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor win helped him regain his position as the top recording artist in the world. His performance also won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture. The Los Angeles Examiner wrote that Sinatra is \\"simply superb, comical, pitiful, childishly brave, pathetically defiant\\", commenting that his death scene is \\"one of the best ever photographed\\". In 1954 Sinatra starred opposite Doris Day in the musical film Young at Heart, and earned critical praise for his performance as a psychopathic killer posing as an FBI agent opposite Sterling Hayden in the film noir Suddenly. Sinatra was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as a heroin addict in The Man With The Golden Arm (1955). After roles in Guys and Dolls, and The Tender Trap, Sinatra was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role as hospital orderly in Stanley Kramer's debut picture, Not as a Stranger. During production, Sinatra got drunk with Robert Mitchum and Broderick Crawford and trashed Kramer's dressing room. Kramer vowed to never hire Sinatra again at the time, and later regretted casting him as a Spanish guerrilla leader in The Pride and the Passion (1957). In 1956 Sinatra featured alongside Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly in High Society for MGM, earning a reported 250,000 for the picture. The public rushed to the cinemas to see Sinatra and Crosby together on-screen, and it ended up earning over 13 million at the box office, becoming one of the highest-grossing pictures of 1956. In 1957, Sinatra starred opposite Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak in George Sidney's Pal Joey, for which he won for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Santopietro considers the scene in which Sinatra sings \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\" to Hayworth to have been the finest moment of his film career. He next portrayed comedian Joe E. Lewis in The Joker Is Wild; the song \\"All the Way\\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. By 1958 Sinatra was one of the ten biggest box office draws in the United States, appearing with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in Vincente Minnelli's Some Came Running and Kings Go Forth with Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. \\"High Hopes\\", sung by Sinatra in the Frank Capra comedy, A Hole in the Head (1959), won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and became a chart hit, lasting on the Hot 100 for 17 weeks. Due to an obligation he owed to 20th Century Fox for walking off the set of Henry King's Carousel (1956), in 1960 Sinatra starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Maurice Chevalier and Louis Jourdan in Can-Can. He earned 200,000 and 25% of the profits for the performance. Later that year he starred in the Las Vegas-set Ocean's 11, the first film to feature the Rat Pack together and the start of a \\"new era of screen cool\\" for Santopietro. Sinatra personally financed the film, and paid Martin and Davis Jr. fees of 150,000 and 125,000 respectively, sums considered exorbitant for the period. In 1962, Sinatra had a leading role opposite Laurence Harvey in The Manchurian Candidate, which he considered to be the role he was most excited about and the high point of his film career. Vincent Canby, writing for the magazine Variety, found the portrayal of Sinatra's character to be \\"a wide-awake pro creating a straight, quietly humorous character of some sensitivity.\\" He appeared with the Rat Pack in the western Sergeants 3, following it with 4 for Texas in 1963. For his performance in Come Blow Your Horn, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Though 1965's Von Ryan's Express was a major success, and he had directed None but the Brave that year, in the mid 1960s, Brad Dexter wanted to \\"breathe new life\\" in Sinatra's film career by helping him display the same professional pride in his films as he did his recordings. On one occasion, he gave Sinatra Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) to read, with the idea of making a film, but Sinatra thought it had no potential and did not understand a word. In the late 1960s, Sinatra became known for playing detectives, including Tony Rome in Tony Rome (1967) and its sequel Lady In Cement (1968). He also played a similar role in 1968's The Detective. In 1970, Sinatra starred opposite George Kennedy in the western Dirty Dingus Magee, an \\"abysmal\\" affair according to Santopietro, which was panned by the critics. The following year, Sinatra received a Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and had intended to play Detective Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971), but had to turn the role down due to developing Dupuytren's contracture in his hand. Sinatra's last major film role was opposite Faye Dunaway in Brian G. Hutton's The First Deadly Sin (1980). Santopietro said that as a troubled New York City homicide cop, Sinatra gave an \\"extraordinarily rich\\", heavily layered characterization, one which \\"made for one terrific farewell\\" to his film career. Question: did he win any awards. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Frank Sinatra won awards for his acting in movies. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film \\"From Here to Eternity.\\" He also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture for the same role. Additionally, Sinatra won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in \\"Pal Joey.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this article and answer this question Following their first win of the season, the Colts faced another divisional rival in the Tennessee Titans. After being forced to punt on their first offensive drive, the Colts' defense forced a fumble that was recovered by Ricky Jean-Francois and set up the Colts inside Titan territory. After a 37-yard pass from quarterback Andrew Luck to T. Y. Hilton set the Colts up at the one yard line, Trent Richardson scored on the next play, putting the Colts up 7-0. An onside kick gave the ball back to the Colts, which led to an eleven play, 44-yard drive that ended in a touchdown pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Colts' defense again forced a turnover on the Titans' next possession, with Charlie Whitehurst throwing an interception to Mike Adams. Luck and the Colts' offense again drove down the field, though this time having to settle for a field goal, extending the lead to 17-0. Tennessee scored their first points midway through the second quarter on a Ryan Succop. The Colts responded on their next possession with a 30-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. A Luck interception late in the half, set up the Titans in Colts' territory and allowed them to score on a pass from Whitehurst to Delanie Walker, cutting the Colts' lead to 20-10 at halftime. The Colts' scored on their first offensive possession of the second half, on a 28-yard touchdown pass from Luck to Reggie Wayne and then later in the quarter on a pass from Luck to Coby Fleener, extending the Colts' lead to 34-10. Tennessee responded with an eight play, 80-yard drive that ended with a touchdown run from Bishop Sankey. Luck completed his fourth touchdown pass of the game early in the fourth quarter, this time on a 15-yard pass to Ahmad Bradshaw, giving the Colts a 41-17 lead. Late in the game, Adams again forced another turnover, with Zach Mettenberger throwing the interception. During the game, Reggie Wayne caught seven passes for 119 yards and one touchdown, which was enough to move him to seventh on the NFL all-time receptions list and tenth on the most receiving yards list.

Options: - more rest - rest more - were sick - drink water - you're sick The answer is \\"you're sick\\" because The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"You're sick,\\" because this statement indicates that the mother is aware of her son's illness and is prioritizing his health over his attendance at school. In this scenario, the mother likely wants her son to focus on recovery and avoid exacerbating the illness. The mom is probably saying, \\"You're sick,\\" as a way to remind her son of the current situation and the reason behind her decision. It shows that she is concerned about his well-being, empathizes with his condition, and wants him to take the necessary steps to recover from his sickness. Attending school while sick could potentially worsen his health and even infect others; thus, it is best for him to stay at home and get proper rest. Furthermore, the other options do not directly address the cause or justify the reason for the mom's decision. The options \\"more rest\\" and \\"rest more\\" imply that the son needs more sleep, but they do not specify the reason. These phrases could be used in any situation where the mom believes her son is tired, regardless of whether he is ill or not. The option \\"were sick\\" uses incorrect grammar (it should be \\"we're sick\\") and doesn't clearly provide the explanation behind the choice. If the mother meant, \\"we're sick,\\" it would suggest that both she and her son are ill, which is not relevant to the son staying home from school. Lastly, the option \\"drink water\\" is practical advice, but it doesn't answer the question of why the son should stay in bed instead of going to school. In this context, the mom's intention is to address her son's illness, make him aware of the situation, and focus on recovery. Therefore, the answer \\"you're sick\\" provides the most suitable explanation for the mom's decision and aligns with her concern for her son's well-being. By making this statement, the mother demonstrates an understanding of the importance of prioritizing health over school attendance and wants to ensure that her son has the best opportunity to recover quickly and without complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Team A and Team B were two teams of students studying zoology. Team A learned about reptiles, while Team B studied more about amphibians. Which team learned more about turtles? A:","completion":"Team A learned more about turtles, as turtles are classified as reptiles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band's current lineup comprises guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, drummer Gene Hoglan, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. Since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, leaving Peterson as the only constant member. Billy replaced original singer Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza (who left the band to join Exodus as the replacement of Paul Baloff) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. As early as 2009, Testament commenced writing new material for their tenth album. In an interview with Metalheadz, guitarist Eric Peterson stated that there were about four songs written and that \\"there's other guys in the band who like to play the more rock melodic style but the next one is gonna be a bit heavier.\\" In a January 2011 interview during the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise, frontman Chuck Billy revealed that Testament had been working on six new songs, with four or five \\"maybe left to write,\\" and would begin recording their new album by early March. On 18 May 2011, guitarist Alex Skolnick posted an update on his Twitter, saying, \\"Another tune done! My riffs from last week [plus] some of [fellow Testament guitarist Eric Peterson's plus] new ones we wrote today. Planning one more, then we've got more than we need.\\" Testament began recording their tenth studio album on June 20, 2011. Drummer Paul Bostaph was unable to take part in the recording due to a \\"serious injury\\", although he was expected to rejoin when the band tours to support the album. Gene Hoglan, who played drums on the band's 1997 album Demonic, filled in for Bostaph. It was also reported that Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler would make a special guest appearance on a couple of bonus tracks. Testament appeared at the California dates of the summer 2011 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival, replacing In Flames. On 14 July 2011, it was announced that the tenth Testament studio album would be called Dark Roots of Earth, which, after many delays, was released on July 27, 2012. Dark Roots of Earth debuted at No. 12 on Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position to date. Prior to the album's release, the band toured in the fall of 2011 with Anthrax and Death Angel. Overkill was invited to the tour, but due to the pre-production of their sixteenth studio album The Electric Age, they did not participate. It was announced on 1 December 2011 that Paul Bostaph had left Testament. Gene Hoglan recorded the drum tracks for Dark Roots of Earth and continues to play live with the band. In interviews, Testament have expressed pleasure in Hoglan's playing, and hope that he would continue playing with the band for the foreseeable future.

Options: - shoes - stay still - hands - walk - stink Explain why a human would choose \\"stay still\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"stay still\\" as the answer to the question above because the situation described in the question suggests that Miranda is having an issue with being unable to stop moving her smelly feet. When looking at the given options, \\"stay still\\" is the most relevant and appropriate choice, as it directly relates to Miranda's inability to control her feet's movement. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not suitable answers: - Shoes: Although Miranda's feet are smelly, the question does not mention anything about shoes or being instructed to wear shoes or do something related to them. - Hands: The question is focusing on Miranda's feet, and there's no reference to her hands or any action she's instructed to take with her hands, making it an irrelevant choice. - Walk: Choosing \\"walk\\" could be considered a reasonable choice if Miranda was asked to walk but had difficulties controlling her feet's movement; however, based on the question's context, it doesn't appear that she's having issues with walking, but rather stopping her feet from moving. - Stink: This option is related to the smelly feet, but it doesn't seem like she was instructed to make her feet smell.

Now let me explain why other answers are wrong. [1] is wrong because it starts discussing when to prune the tree and how to do it, but the question is about the disinfecting process of tools.

Please answer a question about the following article about Pharmaceutical industry: By the 1890s the profound effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as hemostatic agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897 John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist).

Here are possible answers to this question: - suburbs - large house - farm house - palace - country estate I believe the correct choice is \\"large house\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"large house,\\" and there are several reasons why this option is the most suitable among the alternatives presented. First, let's consider each option and how it fits into the context of a back courtyard leading to a walkout basement: 1. \\"Suburbs\\" - This refers to a residential area located on the outskirts of a city, typically characterized by a prevalence of single-family homes. Although it is possible to find houses with walkout basements in suburban neighborhoods, this term does not provide specific information about the type of building attached to the back courtyard. 2. \\"Large house\\" - This option provides a much clearer picture of the building in question. A large house signifies a spacious and potentially multi-storied residence with numerous rooms. It seems more fitting for a back courtyard and walkout basement to be part of such a residence, given that these features require the kind of space a large house could accommodate. 3. \\"Farm house\\" - While farmhouses might have back courtyards and even walkout basements, they are primarily associated with agricultural lands and rural surroundings. Although it is a somewhat plausible option, the question does not provide any contextual clues to suggest that the house in question belongs to a farm setting. 4. \\"Palace\\" - This term refers to the residence of royalty or other members of higher social circles. A palace is likely to have a courtyard and potentially even a walkout basement. However, given the grand and ostentatious nature of a palace, using such terminology to describe this particular setting seems less fitting than simply referring to the structure as a large house. 5. \\"Country estate\\" - This option refers to a large, multi-acre property, often owned by people from wealthier social backgrounds. While a country estate might include expansive courtyards and walkout basements, this term places more emphasis on the surrounding land rather than the house itself. Therefore, describing the building as a large house seems more precise and fitting for the context provided. Taking all these options into account, \\"large house\\" emerges as the most fitting and accurate choice. A back courtyard leading to a walkout basement requires ample space and likely involves a larger residence. In addition, the other options either refer to a more specific context that is not hinted at within the question or emphasize geographical location rather than the architectural features of the building. Consequently, \\"large house\\" stands out as the most fitting answer to describe the building attached to the back courtyard with a walkout basement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Utada Hikaru (Yu Duo Tian hikaru, born January 19, 1983), who also goes by the mononym Utada (English: ), is a Japanese-American singer-songwriter and producer. Born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer Utada Teruzane and enka singer Abe Junko, Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo, as a result of her father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with Toshiba-EMI was signed and, under the stage name \\"Cubic U\\", Utada released her English-language debut album Precious in early 1998, but was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, her Japanese-language debut First Love was released and became an instant success. On December 16, 2008, information leaked onto the Internet that Utada's next English-language single, titled \\"Come Back to Me\\", would be scheduled for airplay release through U.S. Rhythmic/Crossover and Mainstream formats on February 9 and 10, 2009 respectively via Island Records. The new English album, titled This Is the One, was released on March 14, 2009 in Japan and on May 12, 2009 in the United States. This Is the One debuted at number 1 in Japan on March 13, 2009, the day it was released in Japan, but became Utada's first album not to top the weekly chart since Precious. On March 30, 2009 she appeared on New York City radio station Z-100 (100.3), the largest pop radio program in the U.S., and granted a live on-air interview on the station's Elvis Duran Morning Show, a breakthrough that would lead to a promotional schedule up and through the album's international physical release on May 12. Utada also sang the theme song for the second Evangelion film, Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance. The single was released on June 27, 2009, and is a remix of her previous single, \\"Beautiful World\\". The new single is titled Beautiful World -PLANiTb Acoustica Mix-. On October 14, Utada stated that she was writing lyrics that were due on October 15. She also added that some \\"German magic\\" would be added to the music. It was revealed that Goetz B, who had previously worked with Utada on her album Ultra Blue was in the process of mixing tracks for her. On November 30, 2009, at Studio Coast, Tokyo, Utada sung a duet of Let It Snow with pop singer Mika. On December 21, 2009, Utada's Dirty Desire remixes were released only on Amazon.com, Zune Marketplace, and the U.S. iTunes Store, in support of This Is the One and her upcoming tour.

Answer the question: Mona urinated yesterday morning and the urine was very light. When she urinated today the urine was very dark. Which urination contained less water yesterday morning or today? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Today's urination contained less water as compared to yesterday morning's urination. The color of urine can be an indication of an individual's hydration levels, and it is based on the concentration of various waste products and solutes present in the urine. When a person is well-hydrated, their kidneys function efficiently in filtering waste products and solutes from the bloodstream, resulting in relatively larger volumes of diluted (or light-colored) urine. Light yellow or clear urine typically signifies optimum hydration, as there is more water present to dilute the waste products and solutes. On the other hand, dark-colored urine often indicates that there is less water present to dissolve and eliminate waste products, and the kidneys are retaining more water to maintain a balance in the body. This results in the production of smaller volumes of concentrated urine, which consequently appears darker. Some factors that contribute to dark-colored urine include dehydration, certain medications or supplements, and even some foods. However, it is essential to note that the color of the urine can also be influenced by other factors such as certain medical conditions or the presence of substances produced by the body. In Mona's case, it can be inferred that yesterday morning, she was adequately hydrated, so her urine had a higher water content, leading to a lighter color. In contrast, today, her urine is dark, suggesting that it contains less water as compared to her urine from yesterday morning. There could be several reasons behind this difference, such as her fluid intake patterns, dietary habits, or physical activities. However, if Mona regularly experiences dark-colored urine or notices additional symptoms, it may be wise for her to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any potential underlying medical issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you see something interesting or potentially valuable, remove it from the bin and take it home. Be sure to use a disinfectant cleaner to wipe down the item, as it was in the trash and could be ridden in germs. For instance, you could discover an old violin that is worth up to 50,000. Avoid trespassing on private property. Buildings around the house are great places to search for treasure. Be sure to investigate high and low, and keep an eye out for loose bricks or boards.

But when the yearly games for the disabled were started at Stoke Mandeville, England in 1948 by Sir Ludwig Guttmann, the situation began to change. Sir Ludwig Guttmann, who had been driven to England in 1939 from Nazi Germany, had been asked by the British government to set up an injuries center at Stoke Mandeville Hospital near London, His ideas about treating injuries included sport for the disabled. In the first games just two teams of injured soldiers took part .The next year, 1949, five teams took part. From those beginnings, things have developed fast. Teams now come from abroad to Stoke Mandeville every year. In 1990 the first Olympics for the disabled were held in Rome, in the same place as the normal Olympic Games. Now, every four years the Olympic Games for the disabled are held, if possible, in the same place as the normal Olympic Games, although they are organized separately. In other years games for the disabled are still held at Stoke Mandeville, In the 1984 Wheelchair Olympic Games, 1,064 wheelchair athletes form about 40 countries took part. Unfortunately, they were held at Stoke Mandeville and not in Los Angeles, along with the other Olympics. The games have been a great success in helping the progress of international friendship and understanding, and in proving that being disabled does not mean you can't enjoy sport. One small source of disappointment for those who organize and take part in the games, however, has been the unwillingness of the International Olympic Committee to include disabled events at the Olympic Games for the able-bodied. Perhaps a few more years are still needed to persuade those fortunate enough not to be disabled that their disabled fellow athletes should be included.

STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan \\"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,\\" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. \\"In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),\\" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added.

Structure: Both sentences are simple and follow an \\"[X] is [doing action]\\" structure. The structure similarity provides a score of 1. 2. Content: The subjects of the sentences are quite different. One sentence is talking about a woman while the other is talking about a lion. In terms of content, the sentences are not similar. This aspect gives a score of 0. 3. Action: In the first sentence, the action is a woman peeling a potato, which is a culinary activity. In the second sentence, the action is a lion walking around, which is an animal in motion. While both sentences describe an action being performed, the nature of the actions being performed is quite different – peeling a potato is a focused, domestic task, while walking around is a more general, motion-based action. Due to the difference in actions, this aspect gives a score of 1. Adding up the scores from each aspect (1+0+1), we have a total score of 2.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What building as it currently stands dates from the period of Henry VIII? , can you please find it? As a result of Henry's expansion, St Peter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. It was rebuilt by Edward I at a cost of over £300 and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th century. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.

The Greek ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes—the \\"villain\\" of Hanukkah—built the Acra 2,000 years ago to exert control over Jerusalem, according to the Times of Israel. On Tuesday, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the ruins of the fortress had finally been found—under a parking lot.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lez miserable: I came out in a country town, and everything changed in an instant I was 19 and living in Toowoomba, a regional city in South East Queensland. Even though Toowoomba has a decent population, it has always had a small country-town feel. It has a lot of conservative people, a lot of old people, and a lot of religious people. I had just dropped out of my first attempt at university, and I was working in a very glamorous job as a cleaner in the Grand Central food court, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Every single day, I was growing to hate humanity more. I hated how employees in the fast food industry were treated, and the humiliating working conditions we had to put up with. Hated how most of the general public treated us, like we were stupid, worthless, invisible – mere servants. (As an aside, pay attention to how the person you are dating treats wait staff and cleaners, it gives you a good indication of their empathy levels and how they will treat you one day.) I was getting towards the end of my rope with each passing day. Taking the piles of rubbish into the lift on a trolley, descending down to the smelly loading dock where I would toss the bags into the crusher (the only fun part of the entire experience), I used to wish for the lifts to stop and trap me. I would have preferred to spend hours in an elevator with bags of rubbish in a Queensland summer than have one more person look at me like I was a piece of dog shit on their shoe as I took their leftover KFC to the bin. All of that changed in an instant when she came along. Alexandra. I noticed her name immediately, shining on the new badge pinned to her shirt. I noticed her the minute she started working at the sandwich shop I passed a hundred times a shift. By now I knew most of the people working in most of the shops in the food court, and I would always try to become friendly with new workers, it made my job easier if they liked me. I decided to do that with Alexandra as well. But this time it was different, I was too nervous to strike up a conversation. So I just went about my day, glancing over at her from time-to-time. She was about my age, smiley, bouncy, expressive, and completely adorable. That was my routine for a couple of days, until my manager told me to go to the sandwich shop to ask them a question about plastic trays. Alexandra was the only person there when I went up. Up close, I discovered that her face was covered with hundreds of light freckles. I introduced myself. At that time I lived with my parents, and I was in the closet. Back then the small-town vibe of Toowoomba lent itself very easily to small-mindedness and homophobia, but (thanks in part to the internet) I had started becoming much more comfortable in my own skin, finally identifying as a lesbian. I was starting to think seriously about coming out to my family, to dating, to take part in what my friends had been experiencing for years. I really had no opportunity to open up before. By that point, I think I had one openly gay male friend. I didn’t know any women who were interested in other women, and I never, ever had. But there was something in the way that she looked at me. Somehow I knew that this was different, something I had never experienced before. My mouth was dry and my heart was racing as I walked away. In the weeks that followed, work was much easier to get through. I would try to seem cool, spending my minimal cleaner wages buying a sandwich from her every day instead of bringing lunch from home. I aimed to make her laugh, which was actually quite easy because she was so full of joy (and I am hilarious). I would take the food, and I would make sure to sit where she could see me. I would recline back and listen to music, and read the paper or a book I thought would impress her. I had no idea what I was doing, but it somehow seemed to work. She asked me what music I was always listening to, and we bonded over PJ Harvey. After that, she asked if I wanted to have lunch together, and knowing that this meant she had changed the time of her shift to be able to do it, my heart roared and my stomach fizzled with nerves. After that, we would text and call, and have breakfast together before our shifts started. She was smart, she was funny, and she felt like she didn’t fit in this town or with her family. She wanted to escape. This all somehow felt different to how I had interacted with new friends in the past. I could feel that it was building to something, and I could see it in her eyes, and in her smile when I would look up and catch her looking at me from across the food court. She was all I thought about. When she sat with me and read the paper, the backs of our hands would touch, and I would think about that for the rest of the day. She called on a Friday afternoon to invite me out to a pub that night. Toowoomba is not a very big place; I had been to most of the pubs. Not this one. It was a run-down old pub, where I assumed the clientele were 80 year-old men talking about the races, or being racist. Or both. Of course I said yes, wondering if she wanted to go there so nobody would see us together. We drove to the pub, singing to PJ Harvey on the way. At some point she offhandedly told me that she had found out that once a month, on this particular night, the pub we were going to had a “gay night”. So, this was it then. Proof. My stomach was churning. She parked behind the pub, in the dirt car park with no lighting. We got out, and she came around to my side of the car. And then, she put her hand on my wrist to stop me walking off, and leaned in and kissed me. My first kiss from a woman, the thing I had been unsuccessfully trying not to fantasise about my entire life. A soft pressing of her lips on mine, and in that moment my mind and body reacted like one of those exploding bi-carb and vinegar volcanos people make for science class. And that was it. I was done for. We went inside the pub, and our dynamic was so different than before I had gotten out of her car. The pub had quite a few people in it, just normal looking humans playing pool, or drinking at tables. But all I could focus on was her, I had blinders on for the rest of the world. And she did too. We flirted, touched discreetly, and chose songs on the jukebox. We played pool and drank and laughed, and pressed ourselves against each other when we could get away with it. Up to that point, it was the greatest night of my life. We were comfortable, knowing that the other people there would be on our side. That’s a funny thing. As far as I know, I am the only queer person in my giant extended family, whom I love dearly. I have always had more straight friends than gay friends. I feel totally comfortable around heterosexual people, especially the wonderful ones I choose as my friends. And yet, on the rare times I am at a gay bar, or at a pride event, or somewhere that I am in the majority, it feels different. And it feels nice. It is hard to explain, but it is almost like a weight is lifted. For brief moments, every single cell that makes up me knows that I am completely safe. Not only safe, but also accepted. I can’t be judged, I won’t be assumed to be straight, I won’t be asked questions, I won’t have a slur thrown at me, I won’t have a man hitting on me, I won’t make anyone uncomfortable by being me. I just am. The euphoria made time pass quickly, and the light outside faded as it got later and later into the evening. We were sitting at a table drinking, and talking, and she was telling me about a tattoo she planned on getting on her upper arm. She grabbed my hand, and ran my fingertips slowly over the spot she wanted it, staring into my eyes. Oh yes, something was building up. The moment is burned into my memory– the moment before everything changed. The door swung open, and in walked a group of young drunk people. I figured out pretty quickly they were unaware of the pub’s “gay night”. But unfortunately, they were aware of who Alexandra was, and it turned out that they were friends of hers. Her face fell, she quickly moved her chair away from me, and bounced up to greet them. She introduced me as someone “from work”, and that’s when I knew this wasn’t going to be good. I think they were friends that she had known from school, and they certainly didn’t match the person I had come to know. They weren’t people that I would want to be friends with, either. They questioned what we were doing there, and she told them that we wanted a quiet drink before heading into the “city” (a few blocks over) to go clubbing. What a cool coincidence, that is what they were doing as well! So, that’s what we did. We all left in a drunken group, and headed to one of the gross clubs in the main street of Toowoomba. From the moment her friends had walked into that pub, she had shut down to me completely. I was a stranger that had just glommed onto their group. I was hoping to find a chance to talk to her, explain that I understood she didn’t want any of them to find out about us, to explain that I knew the fear, that it was okay. Instead, I found myself standing on the upstairs balcony of the pub, tequila sunrise in my hand (I was a 40 year old trapped in a 19 year old body). I watched as she left to go to the bar with Brad, an obnoxious Bintang-singlet, cap wearing, probably racist, rats-tail having, hotted up-Holden kind of guy. I watched as she flirted with him at the bar, smiling that smile I had come to know as for me. I watched as she made the briefest eye contact with me on their way back, the flicker of hurt and sadness in her eyes reflecting mine, before the shutters came down. I sat there with her friends as Brad took her to talk somewhere quieter, my stomach filling with more dread as each second passed. I sat there when they came back holding hands, and she was doing everything she could not to look at me. And I sat there when he pulled her onto his lap and stuck his tongue in her mouth. Then I wasn’t sitting there anymore. I was up, and I was almost hyperventilating. I ran past them, and down the stairs. I wasn’t there anymore, I wasn’t anywhere. I was crying on the street, as a million Brads and a million Alexandras walked past me. I was looking for someone to understand, but nobody could, so instead I looked for a cab. As one pulled up to the kerb, I heard her say my name, and she was behind me. She looked pale, her freckles as stark as I have ever seen them against her skin. She looked terrified, and devastated. I knew from looking at her that this was the way it had to be. She said five words to me, as I opened the door to that cab. She said “I don’t want...” and gestured back towards the club. Then her hands fell to her sides. She looked empty, and with tears in her eyes she said “I’m sorry”. I got in, and the cab drove away. I didn’t look back. I am 32 now. And yet, I can still feel every single emotion that I felt on that night. Finally opening up to someone after years of pushing every emotion down far enough so that you can’t feel anything, finally opening up to someone despite the fact that you are terrified, only to have their fear be the thing that overwhelms you both. You don’t need to look very hard to see the effects of homophobia on public policy, or to see how queer and trans people are treated in society, facing slurs, discrimination and violence. But as this story shows, homophobia also just plainly breaks our hearts. I know that Alexandra ended up marrying a man (not Brad) soon after, and stayed in Toowoomba. If I’m being optimistic I like to believe that it would have happened anyway, that it was what she truly wanted, and that she is happy. But remembering the look on her face, I’m not optimistic very often. There is every chance I could be wrong, and I hope I am. Even after it happened, I didn’t harbour any anger towards her. How could I? She was taught that what we were doing was wrong, that people like her parents might not love her if she went through with it, and that the right thing was to be with him. When I think of that night now, I just feel awful for us both. Alexandra and I didn’t have the chance to find out what might have been. We didn’t get to have the kind of relationship you have when you are 19, where everything is amazing and full of energy and excitement. And so every time someone like Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook comes out, and comes out in such a public way, we get closer and closer to a world where people like Alexandra aren’t filled with fear, or self-hatred, and can safely experience love with the people they want to. And that will be a beautiful thing.

Testament is an American thrash metal band from Berkeley, California. Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, the band's current lineup comprises guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick, lead vocalist Chuck Billy, drummer Gene Hoglan, and bassist Steve Di Giorgio. Since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, leaving Peterson as the only constant member. Billy replaced original singer Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza (who left the band to join Exodus as the replacement of Paul Baloff) in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since. Testament's second album, The New Order, was released in May 1988, and found the band continuing in a similar vein. The album was a minor success, peaking at number 136 on the Billboard 200, and managed to sell over 250,000 copies. In support of The New Order, Testament opened for Megadeth on their So Far, So Good... So What! tour in Europe, and toured the United States with the likes of Death Angel, Vio-Lence and Raven. After touring in support of The New Order, the band headed back into the studio to record their third studio album Practice What You Preach. Released in August 1989, the album minimized the occult and gothic themes found in the lyrical content of their first two albums, instead focusing on real-life issues such as politics and corruption. Practice What You Preach performed better on the charts than The New Order, reaching at number 77 on the Billboard 200, and included the hit single, the title track, which saw extensive airplay on Headbangers Ball. Testament toured for nearly a year behind Practice What You Preach with several bands, including Annihilator, Wrathchild America, Mortal Sin, Nuclear Assault and Savatage. By 1990, the album had sold over 450,000 copies. In October 1990, Testament released their fourth studio album Souls of Black. Although reviews were mixed, the album managed to sell respectably, in no doubt largely off the strength of the single title track, and saw the band perform on arena tours, including the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies. They also opened for Judas Priest on their Painkiller tour from October to December 1990, and Slayer on their Seasons in the Abyss tour from January to March 1991. Attempting to reconnect with an audience distracted by the growing grunge movement, Testament released The Ritual in 1992. The Ritual saw a stylistic move away from thrash to a slower, slightly more traditional heavy metal sound. The Ritual peaked at 55 on the Billboard Hot 100, the band's highest chart position at the time, and the power ballad \\"Return to Serenity\\" managed to receive radio airplay, peaking at number 22. In support of the album, Testament toured Europe and North America, headlining their own tours, as well as opening for Iron Maiden on their Fear of the Dark tour, and Black Sabbath on their Dehumanizer tour. However, the success of The Ritual did not put an end to the tensions within the band. How did the band increase their popularity?","completion":"Testament, a metal band from California, increased their popularity through a few different ways. First, they released albums with catchy songs and meaningful lyrics that connected with their fans. Their albums, like \\"The New Order\\" and \\"Practice What You Preach,\\" sold many copies and had hit singles. Second, they went on many tours, playing live shows in both the United States and Europe. They joined famous bands like Megadeth, Judas Priest, and Slayer on big tours, which helped them reach new fans. Lastly, they adapted their music style at times, such as in their album \\"The Ritual,\\" to get the attention of more people who liked different styles of music.

Context: During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the most dense material on Earth? Have there been denser materials discovered on other planets? What is the most resistant material on earth? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The most dense material on Earth is Osmium, with a density of 22.59 g/cm3. Osmium is a hard, brittle, and blue-gray metal in the platinum group, and it is found in trace amounts in certain ores and specialized alloys. It is used in applications that require high density and hardness, such as electrical contacts, filaments, and the tips of fountain pen nibs. While osmium is the most dense naturally occurring material on Earth, researchers have created denser synthetic materials. One example is compressed atomic metallic hydrogen, which could theoretically reach densities of up to 50 g/cm3, although the exact density is not currently confirmed. Regarding other planets, there is no solid evidence of materials denser than osmium. However, planetary cores, such as those of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, are thought to consist of dense metallic hydrogen due to extreme pressure and temperature conditions that otherwise could not be observed on Earth. Therefore, they could potentially harbor denser materials. The most resistant material on Earth is still a topic of debate as it depends on the context and the specific property (i.e., hardness, strength, or stiffness) being considered. One of the strongest naturally occurring substance on Earth is diamond, which is well-known for its hardness. Diamond is a crystalline form of carbon with a lattice structure that gives it extraordinary hardness and thermal conductivity. It is ranked as a 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, the highest possible ranking. Although diamond is extremely hard, it is also quite brittle. Graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern, is another strong contender as a remarkably resistant material. It is very lightweight, yet it has an extraordinary tensile strength of around 130 gigapascals, making it one of the strongest artificial materials known. It is also incredibly flexible, chemically stable, and a great conductor of heat and electricity. While diamond is still harder than graphene, the latter may be considered more resistant in certain contexts because of its durability, flexibility, and strength. In conclusion, the questions you posed are not the same, as the most dense material (osmium) and the most resistant material (depending on the specific property, it could be diamond or graphene) are distinct in their properties and applications. Density refers to the mass of a substance per unit of volume, while the term 'resistant' can refer to a range of material properties, such as hardness, strength, or stiffness, depending on the context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Please answer this question : Which company fired more people, company X or company Y? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Company X likely fired more people than Company Y.

Question: what are organic semiconductors and what is concept of homo and lumo in organic semiconductor I found the following answer on Google: These are organic charge-transfer complexes and various linear-backbone conductive polymers derived from polyacetylene . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the statement you found on Google provides a brief definition of organic semiconductors, but it does not cover the whole concept behind them nor does it explain the concepts of HOMO and LUMO. Organic semiconductors are materials made from organic (carbon-based) molecules or polymers that have the ability to conduct electricity. They are called semiconductors because their electrical conductivity lies between that of conductors and insulators. These materials have various applications, such as in organic solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Organic charge-transfer complexes and linear-backbone conductive polymers derived from polyacetylene are indeed examples of organic semiconductors, but there are many other types of organic semiconductors, such as conjugated polymers, small molecules, and conductive metal-organic frameworks. The concept of HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) are essential for understanding the electronic structure and properties of organic semiconductors. In molecular orbital theory, electrons in molecules occupy molecular orbitals that result from the combination of atomic orbitals. Each molecular orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons. HOMO refers to the highest-energy molecular orbital that contains electrons, whereas LUMO is the lowest-energy molecular orbital that is unoccupied by electrons. The energy gap between these two orbitals is called the HOMO-LUMO gap, which determines the material's electronic, optical, and redox properties. In the context of organic semiconductors, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are crucial because they contribute to the material's ability to transport charge. When a photon of appropriate energy is absorbed by an organic semiconductor, an electron can be excited from the HOMO to the LUMO, leaving behind an empty state in the HOMO (a hole) and creating an electron-hole pair. These charged species can move through the material and participate in various processes, such as charge generation, separation, and recombination, leading to the semiconductor's overall performance."},{"prompt":"Question: If chemical splashing can cause pain to humans, then what can chemical splashing cause to humans?

Plot title: A Hard Day's Night Movie plot: The plot is a study of a day in the life of the Fab Four beginning with them running from their adoring fans to catch a train. Every plot point circles around the band getting to a television show in order to perform a live concert, and within this stream of action is a series of slapstick, zany, and otherwise wacky bits of funniness. One obstacle in the works is Paul McCartney's babysitting of his grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell), a first class mixer always getting into mischief. It becomes one of the running jokes in the film that Brambell is a \\"clean old man,\\" at least physically (this contrasts with Brambell's most famous role as Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son where he was a \\"dirty old man\\" both physically and psychologically).

By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term.

Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year. Several lakes and small lochs have formed around Neilston: Long Loch, Loch Libo, and Loch Cawpla. Aboon the Brae (Scots language for \\"above the hill\\") is the site of a spring. There are a number of small named-localities in and around Neilston: Arthurlie, Holehouse, Crofthead, Kirkstyle, Coldoun, Gateside, Hollows, Broadley, Nether Kirkton and Neilstonside.Neilston's built environment is characterised by its mixture of 19th- and 20th-century detached cottages, single and two-story buildings. Several mansion houses were built for the owners of former mills and factories. Many of Neilston's dwellings are painted in whites or ivories. In his book Ordnance Survey of Scotland (1884), Francis Hindes Groome remarked that Neilston \\"presents an old-fashioned yet neat and compact appearance\\", a view echoed by Hugh McDonald in Rambles Round Glasgow (1910), who stated that Neilston \\"is a compact, neat, and withal somewhat old-fashioned little township\\", although continued that it has \\"few features calling for special remark\\". It is frequently described as a quiet dormitory village, although some sources from around the turn of the 20th century describe Neilston as a town. There is a mixture of suburbs, semi-rural, rural and former-industrial locations in Neilston, but overwhelmingly the land use in central Neilston is sub-urban. The territory of Neilston is not contiguous with any other settlement, and according to the General Register Office for Scotland, does not form part of Greater Glasgow, the United Kingdom's fifth largest conurbation. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person that agreed with the views of the author of Ordnance Survey of Scotland?","completion":"The last name of the person that agreed with the views of the author of Ordnance Survey of Scotland is McDonald.

While recovering in the hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from the hospital, Julie closes up the house she lived in with her family and takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, or keeping any clothing or objects from her old life, except for a chandelier of blue beads that presumably belonged to her daughter.For the remainder of the film, Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, as can be derived from a conversation she has with her mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and believes Julie is her own sister Marie-France. She also destroys the score for her late husband's last commissioned, though unfinished, work: a piece celebrating European unity, following the end of the cold war.

And so it chanced; which in those dark And fireless halls was quite amazing, Did we not know how small a spark Can set the torch of love ablazing. T. MOORE. Aurelia rode home in perplexity, much afraid of the combustibles at her girdle, and hating the task her sister had forced on her. She felt as if her heedless avowals had been high treason to her husband; and yet Harriet was her elder, and those assurances that as a true woman she was bound to clear up the mystery, made her cheeks burn with shame, and her heart thrill with the determination to vindicate her husband, while the longing to know the face of one who so loved her was freshly awakened. She was strongly inclined to tell him all, indeed she knew herself well enough to be aware that half a dozen searching questions would draw out the whole confession of her own communication and Harriet's unworthy suspicions; and humiliating as this would be, she longed for the opportunity. Here, however, she was checked in her meditations by a stumble of her horse, which proved to have lost a shoe. It was necessary to leave the short cut, and make for the nearest forge, and when the mischief was repaired, to ride home by the high road. She thus came home much later than had been expected; Jumbo, Molly, and the little girls were all watching for her, and greeted her eagerly. The supper was already on the table for her, and she had only just given Fay and Letty the cakes and comfits she had bought at Brentford for them when Jumbo brought the message that his master hoped that madam, if not too much fatigued, would come to him as soon as her supper was finished.

We want to find out what number we can multiply with f to make the whole equation equal to 0. Here is the equation: -131*f + 16*f + 115 = 0 First, let's combine the terms with f in them. -131*f and 16*f can be added together. Imagine you have -131 apples and someone gives you 16 apples, how many apples do you have then? That's right! You would have -115 apples. So now our equation looks like this: -115*f + 115 = 0 Now, we want to move the 115 to the other side of the equation. It's like having 115 cookies and then giving all of them away, so you're left with 0 cookies. This is how our equation looks now: -115*f = -115 We still need to find the value for f. To do that, we will divide both sides of the equation by -115. It's like saying \\"we have a bag of -115 candies and we want to split it equally, how many times (-115) can we split it to find the answer?\\" So, let's divide: f = -115 / -115 When we divide a negative number by another negative number, the result is positive. So: f = 1 And that's our answer! The value of f that makes the equation true is 1. Great job!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The nautilus (from the Latin form of the original Ancient Greek \\"\\", 'sailor') is a pelagic marine mollusc of the cephalopod family Nautilidae, the sole extant family of the superfamily Nautilaceae and of its smaller but near equal suborder, Nautilina. - Spirula spirula is a species of deep-water squid-like cephalopod mollusk. It is the only extant member of the genus Spirula, the family Spirulidae, and the order Spirulida. Because of the shape of its internal shell, it is commonly known as the ram's horn squid or the little post horn squid. Because the live animal has a light-emitting organ, it is also sometimes known as the tail-light squid. - Permoceras , the sole member of the Permoceratidae , is a coiled nautiloid with a smooth , compressed involute shell , whorls higher than wide , earlier whorls hidden from view . The venter is rounded as are the ventral and umbilical shoulders , the flanks flattened . The siphuncle is ventrally subcentral . The suture , which is most characteristic , has a deep , narrow pointed ventral lobe and large , asymmetrical pointed lobes on either side . Permoceras is included in the nautilid superfamily , Trigonocerataceae , and is derived from the Mississippian ( L Carb ) - Triassic Grypoceratidae . Permoceras was first identified in the Lower Permian of Timur in the East Indies and named by Miller and Collinson in 1953 Permoceras almost precisely resembles Pseudonautilus from the Upper Jurassic . - Cuttlefish are marine animals of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone. Despite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but molluscs. - The siphuncle is a strand of tissue passing longitudinally through the shell of a cephalopod mollusk. Only cephalopods with chambered shells have siphuncles, such as the extinct ammonites and belemnites, and the living nautiluses, cuttlefish, and \\"Spirula\\". In the case of the cuttlefish, the siphuncle is indistinct and connects all the small chambers of that animal's highly modified shell; in the other cephalopods it is thread-like and passes through small openings in the walls dividing the chambers. - A cephalopod (pronounced or ) is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda (Greek plural , \\"kephalópoda\\"; \\"head-feet\\"). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the primitive molluscan foot. Fishermen sometimes call them inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.

India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh has called the release \\"unfortunate and disappointing\\", Indian media reports say. Mr Lakhvi had been granted bail in December, but was kept in detention under public order legislation. That detention was declared void by the High Court, which ordered his release. Mr Lakhvi still faces trial - along with six other suspects - over the attacks, which left 166 people dead and damaged peace efforts between the two countries. Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi's trial in the Mumbai attacks case still continues, but his release on bail suggests the legal evidence presented in court by prosecutors may not be enough for a conviction. This contrasts with six years ago, when the interior minister at the time, Rehman Malik, provided graphic details of how a part of the Mumbai attacks conspiracy was hatched in Pakistan. Indian officials have since said that they also handed evidence against Mr Lakhvi and his comrades to Pakistani prosecutors. Apparently, most of this evidence has not been made part of the case record, indicating legal complications and also perhaps a lack of interest on the part of Pakistani authorities. Analysts say legal technicalities may be one factor behind his release. Another factor, according to some in the intelligence community, may be the fear in security circles that his \\"demobilisation\\" may hurt the morale of Kashmir-focused insurgents, something they say the government does not wish to see. Profile: Lashkar-e-Taiba The Mumbai attacks were blamed on militants of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group (LeT) which Mr Lakhvi was accused of heading. He was arrested by Pakistan on 7 December 2008, four days after he was named by Indian officials as one of the major suspects. A spokesman for Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity accused of links to LeT, said Mr Lakhvi was \\"free now and in a secure place\\". \\"We can't say exactly where is he at the moment for security reasons,\\" the official told AFP. Mr Lakhvi had been receiving special treatment during his time in prison. Jail officers said he, along with six of his comrades, had several rooms at their disposal. They had access to a television, mobile phones and the internet, as well as dozens of visitors a day. These privileges had allowed him to remain in effective contact with the LeT rank and file, the officials said. Elements in the Pakistani establishment are known to have provided such facilities to jailed militant commanders whom they believe they may need in future. The court order to free Mr Lakhvi on bail caused controversy as it came just after militants carried out a massacre at a school in Peshawar last December. The attack prompted the civilian and military leadership to come together to make a rare call for action against \\"all shades of terrorism\\".

Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany. His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene, was German, born in Kassel. Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (who is deceased) and David. Throughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered 1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: I went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers--young kids for the most part--helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country. Willis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \\"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\\" The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \\"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\\" Entity:","completion":"Walter Bruce Willis"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To fold a large nail over another nail. Choose your answer from: - Cut the nail so it bends over the other nail.; - Forge the nail so it bends over the other nail.;","completion":"After analyzing the given goal, which is to fold a large nail over another nail, I would like to provide a detailed explanation for each of the presented solutions before concluding which one is better. 1. Cut the nail so it bends over the other nail: The first solution involves cutting the nail in a way that enables it to bend over the other nail. Cutting the nail means removing or reducing its size by partially cutting through the metal. To perform this procedure, you would need to use a cutting tool, such as a hacksaw or angle grinder, to cut through the nail. Advantages: - Removes the need for heating, as it is a cold-working method. - It can be done relatively quickly, without requiring large or complex tools. - Dimensional accuracy can be achieved with the right cutting technique. Disadvantages: - The nail's structural integrity may be compromised, due to the removal of material. - A clean and smooth bend may not be achievable, due to the cut edges. - The risk of damaging the nail is greater, especially when done manually. - May require additional filing or grinding to smooth the cut edges. 2. Forge the nail so it bends over the other nail: The second solution suggests forging, which is a process that involves heating metal and then shaping it using force to bend it. In this case, you would heat the nail until it reaches a malleable state, then use a hammer or another tool to bend it over the other nail. Advantages: - The nail's structural integrity is preserved, as there is no removal of material. - A clean and smooth bend can be achieved, offering better aesthetics and fewer sharp edges. - The heated metal allows for easier manipulation, and can create stronger bonds through the bending process. - Less risk of damaging the nail, when compared to cutting. Disadvantages: - It requires a heating source, such as a forge or torch, to heat the nail to a malleable state. - The process can be time-consuming, particularly in terms of heating and cooling the metal. - Requires skill and experience in forging, to achieve a precise bend. - Safety concerns must be taken into account due to the hot temperatures involved. In conclusion, considering the goal of folding a large nail over another nail without compromising the strength and aesthetics of the bent nail, the better solution would be to forge the nail so it bends over the other nail. While it may be more time-consuming and require more skill, forging ensures that the nail's structural integrity is maintained, allowing for a cleaner and smoother bend when compared to the cutting method. Additionally, the process of forging offers a better bond between the bent and folded sections of the nail and presents a lower risk of damaging the nail. Therefore, of the given options, forging is the more suitable solution for achieving the desired goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Although Max insisted von Neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the von Neumann archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition.

The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), now known as Airbus Group, expects that several factors will have a negative impact on their financial performance for the years 2006 to 2010. The organization predicts that these factors will lead to a decrease in free cash flow, which represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. A reduction in free cash flow can be an indicator of a business's financial health and its ability to generate returns for its investors. Several factors are likely contributing to this decrease in free cash flow for EADS during this time period. Some possible factors might include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating demand for their products and services, regulatory or political changes, or other economic and market forces affecting the aerospace and defense industry. While the EADS' financial performance during this time was expected to be negatively affected, it is essential to recognize that companies in such dynamic industries often face various challenges and financial pressures. However, the ability to adapt and overcome such challenges is a testament to a company's resilience and long-term success.

This problem is exasperated by the weak character development, leaving the iconic quartet of heroes with little more depth than cardboard cutouts. The special effects are unimpressive and often verge on cheesy, particularly in the climactic battle scene. One might expect the pacing to provide some relief, but the film's sluggish tempo only adds to the litany of disappointments.

Based on the review, your job is to identify language and generate \\"en\\" if the review is in English or generate \\"es\\" if the review is in Spanish. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Input: This paper presents a variational inference based method for learning nonlinear dynamical systems. Unlike the deep Kalman filter, the proposed method learns a state space model, which forces the latent state to maintain all of the information relevant to predictions, rather than leaving it implicit in the observations. Experiments show the proposed method is better able to learn meaningful representations of sequence data. The proposed DVBF is well motivated, and for the most part the presentation is clear. The experiments show interesting results on illustrative toy examples. I think the contribution is interesting and potentially useful, so I’d recommend acceptance. The SVAE method of Johnson et al. (2016) deserves more discussion than the two sentences devoted to it, since the method seems pretty closely related. Like the DVBF, the SVAE imposes a Markovianity assumption, and it is able to handle similar kinds of problems. From what I understand, the most important algorithmic difference is that the SVAE q network predicts potentials, whereas the DVBF q network predicts innovations. What are the tradeoffs between the two? Section 2.2 says they do the latter in the interest of solving control-related tasks, but I’m not clear why this follows. Is there a reason SVAEs don’t meet all the desiderata mentioned at the end of the Introduction? Since the SVAE code is publicly available, one could probably compare against it in the experiments. I’m a bit confused about the role of uncertainty about v. In principle, one could estimate the transition parameters by maximum likelihood (i.e. fitting a point estimate of v), but this isn’t what’s done. Instead, v is integrated out as part of the marginal likelihood, which I interpret as giving the flexibility to model different dynamics for different sequences. But if this is the case, then shouldn’t the q distribution for v depend on the data, rather than being data-independent as in Eqn. (9)? Output:","completion":"en"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the competitive world of beverages, the rivalry between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo has been raging for over a century. While their most iconic soft drinks have constantly been at the forefront of this struggle, another dimension of this battle has emerged in recent years: the bottled water market. With consumers becoming more health-conscious and increasingly preferring water over sugary sodas, both Coke and Pepsi have endeavored to seize this growing market segment. Step 2: Describe Coca-Cola's bottled water brand Justify: Explain Coca-Cola's place in the bottled water market, their brand, and market share. Coca-Cola entered the bottled water market with its brand 'Dasani.' Launched in 1999, Dasani is made from purified municipal tap water and has become the second best-selling bottled water brand in the United States. Coke has experienced remarkable success with Dasani, which now represents a considerable portion of the company's overall sales. Step 3: Describe PepsiCo's bottled water brand Justify: Explain PepsiCo's place in the bottled water market, their brand, and market share. PepsiCo, on the other hand, introduced its own brand of bottled water called 'Aquafina' in 1994. Also made from purified municipal tap water, Aquafina is currently the top-selling bottled water brand in the United States. PepsiCo's Aquafina dominates the market, thereby contributing significantly to the company's overall revenue. Step 4: Strategies employed by both brands Justify: Discuss the strategies adopted by Coke and Pepsi to promote their bottled water brands. To give their bottled water brands a competitive edge and solidify their presence in the market, both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have invested in marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships. Coca-Cola has been made Dasani the official bottled water of many prominent sporting events and partnered with airlines to provide passengers with Dasani water. Similarly, PepsiCo has propelled Aquafina's presence in sports arenas, restaurants, and other venues to further its popularity. Step 5: Environmental concerns and criticisms Justify: Address the environmental impact of bottled water and the criticisms faced by both companies. Despite the commercial success of Dasani and Aquafina, both Coke and Pepsi have faced criticism over the environmental impact of their single-use plastic bottles and the depletion of local water sources. To address these concerns, both companies have initiated efforts towards sustainable packaging and water conservation measures. Step 6: Conclusion Justify: Sum up the battle between Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the bottled water segment and the expected future of this competition. In conclusion, the battle between Coca-Cola's Dasani and PepsiCo's Aquafina represents an extension of the long-standing rivalry between these beverage giants. As the demand for bottled water continues to grow, both companies are likely to invest further in marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, and environmentally-friendly solutions to secure their position in the market. Ultimately, the winner of this bottled water showdown may well shape the future landscape of the global beverage industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His first RBI with the Rockies came in the form of a bases loaded walk in his first plate appearance on September 1, 2009, after being promoted to the club upon roster expansion earlier that day. That year, he had many clutch hits which kept the Rockies in contention for the National League Wild Card. He quickly became a fan favorite in Colorado. On January 23, 2010, Giambi reached an agreement to return to the Colorado Rockies. On September 12 Giambi hit a walk-off home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks, extending the winning streak for the Rockies to 10 games. The Colorado Rockies announced on January 17, 2011 a deal to put Giambi in the team's minor league organization with a spring training invite for the 2011 season.

Information: - Operation Banner was the operational name for the British Armed Forces ' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007 . It was initially deployed at the request of the unionist government of Northern Ireland to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( RUC ) . After the 1998 Belfast Agreement , the operation was gradually scaled down . Its role was to assert the authority of the government of the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland . The main opposition to the British military 's deployment came from the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) . It waged a guerrilla campaign against the British military from 1970 - 97 . An internal British Army document released in 2007 stated that , whilst it had failed to defeat the IRA , it had made it impossible for the IRA to win through violence , and reduced substantially the death toll in the last years of conflict . - The War Office was a department of the British Government responsible for the administration of the British Army between the 17th century and 1964, when its functions were transferred to the Ministry of Defence. - The Royal Ulster Constabulary was the police force in Northern Ireland from 1922 to 2001. Following the awarding of the George Cross in 2000, its formal title became the Royal Ulster Constabulary, GC. It was founded on 1 June 1922 out of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). At its peak the force had around 8,500 officers with a further 4,500 who were members of the RUC Reserve. During the Troubles, 319 members of the RUC were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the Provisional IRA, which made, by 1983, the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians. - The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom. The force was initially administered by the War Office from London, which in 1964 was subsumed into the Ministry of Defence. The professional head of the British Army is the Chief of the General Staff. - Ulster (or \\"Cúige Uladh\\" , Ulster Scots: \\"Ulstèr\\" or \\"Ulster\\") is a province in the north of the island of Ireland. In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\". - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers. - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency. - The Good Friday Agreement (GFA) or Belfast Agreement (or ; Ulster-Scots: \\"Guid Friday Greeance\\" or \\"Bilfawst Greeance\\") was a major political development in the Northern Ireland peace process of the 1990s. - The government of Northern Ireland is, generally speaking, whatever political body exercises political authority over Northern Ireland. A number of separate systems of government exist or have existed in Northern Ireland. - The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c.47) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which established a devolved legislature for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly, after decades of direct rule from Westminster. - The Northern Ireland Assembly (Ulster Scots: \\"Norlin Airlan Assemblie\\") is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast. - The George Cross (GC) is the second highest award of the United Kingdom honours system. It is awarded for gallantry \\"not in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces and to British civilians. It has always been able to be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians including police, emergency services and merchant seamen although no British civilian has received the award since 1976. Many of the awards have been personally presented by the British monarch to both recipients and in the case of posthumous awards to next of kin. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms.

In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - A paramilitary is a semi-militarized force whose organizational structure, tactics, training, subculture, and (often) function are similar to those of a professional military, but which is not included as part of a state's formal armed forces. - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking. - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe. - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area. - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare. - The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC, Irish: \\"Constáblacht Ríoga na hÉireann\\"; simply called the Irish Constabulary 183667) was the armed police force of the United Kingdom in Ireland from the early nineteenth century until 1922. A separate civic police force, the unarmed Dublin Metropolitan Police controlled the capital, and the cities of Derry and Belfast, originally with their own police forces, later had special divisions within the RIC. About seventy-five percent of the RIC were Roman Catholic and about twenty-five percent were of various Protestant denominations, the Catholics mainly constables and the Protestants officers. The RIC's successful system of policing influenced the armed Canadian North-West Mounted Police (predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), the armed Victoria Police force in Australia, and the armed Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in Newfoundland. In consequence of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the RIC was disbanded in 1922 and was replaced by the Garda Síochána in the Irish Free State and the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.

Note that professional-grade, commercially available eye washes are always preferable to homemade remedies. No matter how meticulous you are, there's always the risk of accidentally irritating the eyes or giving yourself a potentially severe infection. There are reported cases of people trying to make saline solution at home and getting acanthamoeba infections. This is a risky procedure. However, if you understand the risks and still want to make your own eye wash solution, there are measures you can take to ensure that your solution is as clean and safe as possible. Begin by boiling a pot of water to kill bacteria and other organisms in it that can contaminate your eyes. Bring the water to a full rolling boil for at least one minute and then cool before use. If possible, it's better to use sterile, purified water rather than ordinary tap water. Tap water can contain more bacteria and additives than sterile water. If you don't want to make an eye wash solution, you can always substitute tap water. Just understand that it may be more irritating and it carries a higher risk of containing bacteria, etc. For homemade eye washes, add one teaspoon of ordinary table salt for each cup of water while the water is boiling. The closer your solution is to the natural salinity (salt concentration) of your tears, the lesser the shock to your eyes. Though the salinity of tears varies based on whether the tears are produced as the result of emotions (pain, sadness, etc.) or merely as a lubricant for the eye during normal use, tears are usually less than 1% salt by weight. Ensure the salt that you add dissolves in the water. Since the water is boiling and you've added a relatively small amount of salt, it shouldn't take much stirring to dissolve it completely. Stir until you no longer see solid salt grains at the bottom of the pot. Never use an eyewash that's still hot. You can seriously injure or even blind yourself by burning your eyes with hot water. Remove your solution from heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. You may transfer the solution to a different container, provided the container has been carefully washed and rinsed with soap and sterile water. When the solution reaches room temperature (or lower) it's ready for use. Cover the solution while it's cooling to ensure no new contaminants are introduced. Keeping the solution cool can give it a refreshing effect when it's used on your eyes. However, don’t cool the eyewash below 60°F (15.6°C). It can be painful and even slightly damaging to your eyes. Even if you take extra care to keep your solution clean, be sure to throw it out after a day or two. Bacteria can be re-introduced to a solution after it's been boiled. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses how, despite the inherent risks and potential for severe infection, individuals can safely make a homemade eye wash solution, iterating that commercially-available, professional-grade eye washes are always preferable. The process involves boiling a pot of water to kill bacteria, with purified water being more desirable than tap water due to the latter's potential for more bacteria and additives. One teaspoon of salt per cup of boiling water is recommended to match the natural salinity of tears. The solution should be stirred until no solid salt remains, then cooled to room temperature while covered to avoid contamination. The solution should not be cooled below 60°F (15.6°C) to avoid causing pain or damage to the eyes, and should be discarded after a day or two to mitigate the risk of bacterial contamination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But we'll see,\\" Coleman said. In a Twitter update, R2 announced: \\"Check me out. I'm in space!\\" A NASA employee on the ground posted the tweet. Nespoli attached NASA's waist-high R2 to a fixed pedestal, where it will remain with its fists clenched and its arms folded against its chest until testing begins in May. The robotic team at Johnson Space Center in Houston wants to see how R2 performs in weightlessness. The robot is intended as an astronaut helper, inside the space station, in the decade ahead.

Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations. The master suite had a king-size bed, with a lounge area and \\"his & hers\\" wardrobes. The VIP cabin had a queen-size bed, also with a lounge area. Both had ensuite bathrooms.

Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: In what year does the passage first mention Rahmon receiving scrutiny? Context: The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers. Answer:","completion":"The passage first mentions Emomali Rahmon receiving scrutiny in the year 2010. This is when the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) criticized Rahmon's administration for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik government was censoring Tajik and foreign websites, and instituting tax inspections on independent printing houses, which led to the cessation of printing activities for several independent newspapers. However, it is worth noting that though this is the first explicit mention of Rahmon receiving scrutiny, the text also implies that his previous electoral victories in 1999 and 2006 were contested and seen as unfair, pointing to earlier scrutiny and criticism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, we must also investigate this, because the markets are so volatile as a whole that every option must be taken into consideration. In order to answer the question of whether this works in Europe, it is important to first have a clear understanding of the context and the specific subject in question, as Europe is a large and diverse continent with varying economic, political, and social systems. Depending on the topic, the feasibility and effectiveness of a certain approach or policy may be highly influenced by these different factors. To examine this thoroughly, we can break down the process into several steps: 1. Identify the subject matter: Gaining clarity on the specific topic or issue in question is crucial in determining whether it can work in Europe. This may involve the analysis of economic policies, political systems, technological advancements, or social trends. 2. Assess the European landscape: After identifying the subject matter, the next step would be to evaluate the existing landscape in Europe. This entails examining the current state of affairs, identifying key players and stakeholders, and evaluating the economic, political, and social climate in various European countries. 3. Evaluate cultural differences: Europe is made up of numerous countries, each with its own unique cultural identity, values, and norms. It is essential to understand these cultural nuances and consider how they may impact the success or failure of a particular approach or policy in different European countries. 4. Learning from past experiences: Analyzing past attempts or case studies that revolve around similar subject matter or policies can provide valuable insights on the potential suitability of a proposed initiative in Europe. This would involve studying both successful and unsuccessful examples to draw important lessons. 5. Assess the potential risks and challenges: Every plan or initiative comes with its own set of potential risks and challenges. Understanding these and taking them into consideration when planning for implementation in Europe can be crucial to the success of the plan. 6. Review the legal and regulatory framework: Lastly, it is important to be aware of the various laws and regulations that govern decision-making and policy implementation in Europe. This includes adherence to European Union policies, as well as national regulations in individual countries. Once the above steps have been thoroughly worked through, it will be possible to make a more informed decision about whether a certain approach, policy, or initiative can work in Europe. It is important to remember that Europe is a complex and diverse continent, and what may work well in one country might not necessarily be effective in another.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"When building a computer, if you want to add resistance, you need more resistors in the circuit. By increasing the number of resistors in a series circuit, the overall resistance of the circuit increases, as the total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of all the individual resistances in the series. To better understand this concept, it is essential to comprehend Ohm's law and the principles of series and parallel circuits. 1. Ohm's Law: V = IR, where V is the voltage drop across the resistor, I is the current passing through the resistor, and R is the resistance of the resistor. 2. Series Circuits: In a series circuit, all the components are connected end-to-end, and there is only one path for the current to flow. The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of the individual resistances: R_total = R1 + R2 + ... + Rn. 3. Parallel Circuits: In a parallel circuit, components are connected side by side so that the current is divided among multiple paths. The reciprocal of the total resistance in a parallel circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn. When you want to increase the resistance in a computer circuit, you need to add more resistors, preferably in a series configuration. This will increase the overall resistance of the circuit, allowing you to control the flow of current and regulate the operation of the computer components as needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: The parents of a three-month-old boy in China are seeking help for their son, who was born with 31 fingers and toes. Hong Hong, who lives in China’s Hunan Province, was born with polydactylism— a congenital condition in which the individual has extra fingers and toes and has two palms, but no thumbs on either hand, Central European News (CEN) reported. The boy’s mother also has the abnormality and was born with one extra finger and toe on each of her hands and feet. The couple was worried that their child would inherit the condition, but doctors found no birth defects during prenatal scans. When the boy was born, he had seven fingers on his right hand and eight on his left, along with eight toes on each of his feet. Zou Chenglin, Hong Hong’s father, said the family has visited multiple hospitals and learned that their son can be operated on between six months and one year of age, which could cure the abnormality. However, the family are migrant workers and are unable to raise the 15,548 to 77,740 needed to cover the procedure, CEN reported. They’re now reaching out to local charities and hoping the public will help give their son a more normal childhood. One difficulty is that the boy’s condition is not life-threatening and therefore not perceived as a priority, compared to the condtion of those suffering from more severe diseases, CEN reported.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. According to the above context, answer the following question. What type of student was Billie Jo?

The Select from: (A). breath is strong. (B). dust is strong.","completion":"As James blew forcefully against the wall, his powerful breath caused layers of dust that had settled there over the years to scatter into the air. The dust particles, once confined to their quiet existence as sediments of the past, were now aroused, awakened, and set loose upon the present. The microscopic army of dust particles seemed to have had quite the resurgence, as they swirled, danced, and spread through the air. The intensity with which they traveled was unanticipated. The sheer number of them, a vivid testament to years of neglect and abandonment, was both astonishing and overwhelming. It was as if they were on some sort of mission, seeking to reclaim their lost territory and establish their dominance over the space once again. Amidst this visually arresting display, Brian found himself standing in the eye of the storm, unaware of the impending attack. In that instant, the strong and resolute dust particles found their target - Brian's eye. Accustomed to the painstaking business of remaining untouched and unseen, the dust had become formidable, seizing the opportunity to exact vengeance in its newfound freedom. As the dust infiltrated his eye, Brian felt a sudden sting, a sharp annoyance, accompanied by a relentless, burning sensation. He raised his hand reflexively, rubbing and blinking fervently in a futile attempt to alleviate himself of this offensive assault. At that very moment, he realized that nothing could have prepared him for the might of these unassuming particles. The dust was strong. This seemingly insignificant event triggered a chain reaction that no one saw coming. In the course of that brief encounter, James and Brian discovered the shared history hidden beneath the layers of dust - tales of past inhabitants, their dreams, desires, and disappointments that had gradually coalesced into the fine grains that now covered the wall. They felt an almost sacred responsibility to tread cautiously, to preserve the delicate fragments of time as they embarked upon their journey forward. The incident served as a crucial reminder to both James and Brian that, sometimes, even the minutest of things can have a monumental impact, and that the seemingly innocuous events can lead to profound revelations. No matter how confident in their abilities, they must never underestimate the strength and persistence of the unlikeliest foes.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

Movie plot title: Rampage Movie plot: Charles Reece is a serial killer who commits a number of brutal mutilation-slayings in order to drink blood as a result of paranoid delusions. Reece is soon captured. Most of the film revolves around the trial and the prosecutor's attempts to have Reece found sane and given the death penalty. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecutor, Anthony Fraser, was previously against capital punishment, but he seeks such a penalty in the face of Reece's brutal crimes after meeting one victim's grieving family.

Spoiled: This refers to food that has gone bad, become rotten, or is no longer safe to eat due to the growth of bacteria, mold, or other spoilage-related factors. Consuming spoiled food can lead to health issues such as foodborne illnesses. Therefore, spoiled food is not considered able to be eaten. 2. Necessary to live: Although food is indeed essential for our survival and provides us with the energy, nutrients, and vitamins needed to maintain good health, not all food falls under this category. Some foods may not be absolutely essential to our lives but can still be consumed. So, although this answer highlights the importance of food, it does not specifically address the question of what food is able to be eaten. 3. Edible: This term directly refers to food that can be safely consumed by humans without causing harm or discomfort. Edible foods are those that are deemed suitable for consumption based on their nutritional content, taste, texture, and safety. With this definition in mind, edible food accurately answers the question of food that is able to be eaten. 4. Supermarket: A supermarket is a self-service store that offers a wide variety of food items, both fresh and pre-packaged, as well as non-food items. Although supermarket shelves hold plenty of edible food, the term itself represents a place where food is sold, not the characteristic of the food that makes it safe and enjoyable to eat. Thus, supermarket does not convey the concept of food being able to be eaten. 5. Unhealthy: Unhealthy food refers to items that are high in calories, fat, sugar, and sodium but low in essential nutrients and vitamins. While unhealthy foods are typically associated with potential long-term negative health effects, they can still be eaten in moderation without causing immediate harm. However, this term does not accurately describe food that is able to be eaten since it focuses on the nutritional aspect rather than the food's suitability for consumption. In conclusion, the term \\"edible\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question, \\"What is food that is able to be eaten?\\" as it precisely defines the condition of food being safe and appropriate for human consumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Thirteenth Floor Movie plot: In late 1990s Los Angeles, Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) owns a multibillion-dollar computer enterprise and is the inventor of a newly completed virtual reality (VR) simulation of 1937 Los Angeles, filled with simulated humans unaware they are computer programs. When Fuller is murdered just as he begins premature testing of the VR system, his friend and protÃ©gÃ©, Douglas Hall (Craig Bierko), who is also the heir to the company, becomes the primary suspect. The evidence against him is so strong that Hall begins to doubt his own innocence. Between interrogations by LAPD Detective Larry McBain (Dennis Haysbert), Hall meets Jane Fuller (Gretchen Mol), the estranged daughter of Hannon Fuller, who is busy with the shutdown of the new VR system. Hall then romances her. When a local bartender is murdered after he claims to have witnessed a meeting between Hall and Fuller on the night Fuller was murdered, Hall is arrested. He is released when Jane gives him an alibi. With the assistance of his associate Whitney (Vincent D'Onofrio), Hall attempts to find a message that Fuller left for him inside the simulation. Entering the virtual reality, Hall becomes a bank clerk named John Ferguson. Fuller left the message with a bartender named Jerry Ashton (Vincent D'Onofrio), who read the message and discovered he is an artificial creation. Earlier, Ashton notices that Ferguson switched places with Hall in the men's restroom of the hotel where Ashton works, and began to realize that something was wrong. Frightened and angry, Ashton tries to kill Hall. Hall barely survives to escape the virtual reality. McBain informs Hall that Jane does not exist, as Fuller never had a daughter. Hall tracks her down only to discover her double, Natasha Molinaro, working as a grocery store clerk â but Molinaro does not recognize Hall. This leads Hall to perform an experiment outside the VR system, something that Fullerâs letter instructed him to try: drive to a place where he never would have considered going otherwise.

Process: - Sediment settles in a place due to gravity - The sediment breaks down into small particles - Wind or water picks up the sediment - The sediment travels along the same route as the wind or water - The sediment is deposited at new locations by the wind or water - The sediment is picked up again by new wind or water - The sediment travels further - The sediment is deposited again in a new place. Question: suppose wind has no effect happens, how will it affect water moves the sediment. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In a scenario where wind has no effect on sediment transportation, the movement of sediment will be greatly influenced by the water alone, leading to a potential change in the behavior of sediment transportation and deposition. It is important to note that both wind and water are fundamental agents of erosion, working together to shape landscapes and transport sediment. By assuming the absence of wind influence, the process of sediment transportation can be analyzed through the sole impact of water. Water moves sediments primarily through a process known as hydraulic action. This process involves the force of water dislodging particles from their original locations through the pressure and motion that water imparts on rock and mineral particles. With no wind interference, the water's movement of sediment could be affected in the following ways: 1. Less spatial dispersion of sediments: In the absence of wind, sediment transportation could become more localized since wind is responsible for dispersing sediment across larger areas. With only water responsible for sediment transportation, the sediment may be transported and deposited in more confined areas, primarily along waterways, riverbeds, and coastal zones. 2. More selective erosion and transportation: Water has a selective nature when it comes to eroding and transporting sediment, as it tends to carry lighter sediments such as silt, clay, and sand more efficiently. Without the wind's ability to transport lighter sediments over longer distances, water may become the primary agent for moving these sediments. As a result, heavier sediments like gravel and stones could be less mobile and remain in place for a longer duration. 3. Possible changes in deposition patterns: In a wind-free scenario, sediment deposition is likely to be affected. Since water follows distinct paths like rivers and streams, the deposition of sediment could become more linear and accumulate mainly along these water channels. This would contrast the more widespread deposition patterns that occur under the influence of both wind and water. 4. Less effectiveness of secondary erosional processes: Without wind, secondary erosional processes such as deflation and abrasion may be less effective, leading to a slower rate of erosion and sediment breakdown. Consequently, larger sediment particles may take a more extended period to break down into smaller, more easily transportable particles. In summary, if wind were not to have any effect on sediment transportation, the process would mostly rely on water, leading to less dispersion, more selective erosion and transportation, altered deposition patterns, and reduced effectiveness of secondary erosional processes. Overall, the sediment transportation process would be affected significantly, altering the dynamics of erosion and deposition in affected areas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Fungi are eukaryotes in the Fungus Kingdom. Fungi include molds, which are multicellular, and yeasts, which are single-celled. Q: Molds and yeasts are organisms in what kingdom? Choices: - tissues - insects - aquatic - fungus A: The answer is:","completion":"The answer is \\"fungus.\\" The given paragraph states that \\"Fungi are eukaryotes in the Fungus Kingdom.\\" This indicates that fungi belong to the Fungus Kingdom, which is one of the five major kingdoms of life. The other four kingdoms are Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants), Protista (protists), and Monera (prokaryotes, such as bacteria). The paragraph further explains that fungi include two groups: molds and yeasts. Molds are described as multicellular organisms, which means that they are comprised of multiple cells. These organisms typically grow in thread-like structures called hyphae, which form a bigger mass called mycelium. Some common examples of molds include Penicillium and Aspergillus, which can be found in soil, decaying organic matter, and various food products. On the other hand, yeasts are single-celled fungi. These are generally microscopic in size and reproduce through a process called budding. Yeasts play a significant role in the food and beverage industry, particularly in the making of bread and alcoholic beverages like beer and wine. A well-known example of yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly used for baking and brewing purposes. Molds and yeasts belong to the Fungus Kingdom, a group of organisms that exhibit unique characteristics and play essential roles in ecosystems. They are involved in the decomposition of organic materials, thus helping recycle nutrients in the environment. Moreover, some fungi also play essential roles in mutualistic relationships, such as mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, which aid plants in absorbing nutrients from the soil. Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct choice among the given options is \\"fungus,\\" as both molds and yeasts are organisms within the Fungus Kingdom. The other choices listed, namely tissues (which are collections of cells performing a specific function in an organism), insects (a class of organisms within the Animal Kingdom), and aquatic (referring to organisms living in water), are not accurate options when considering the kingdom to which molds and yeasts belong."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Information: - Tuti Island (also spelled Tutti Island) is an island in Sudan where the White Nile and Blue Nile merge to form the main Nile. It is surrounded by the \\"Three Towns\\": Khartoum (the capital of Sudan), Omdurman (the largest city in Sudan), and Khartoum North (also known as Bahri, a large industrial center). Despite this, Tuti is home to only one small village (founded in the late 15th century), with grassland being the main makeup of the island. In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via several ferries that cross the river every so often, but now the Tuti Bridge, a modern suspension bridge, has been completed and can be used instead. Tuti Island is mainly agricultural and where Khartoum gets most of its supply of fruits and vegetables and therefore, you can find many farms situated all around the island, many of them still using manual methods of farming. You will find acres of green fields and lime groves. - The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is a modern suspension bridge linking between Tuti Island and the City of Khartoum that was completed in February 2008 . In the past the only approach to Tuti Island was via ferries but thanks to the Tuti - Khartoum Bridge , easy access to the island is possible . The Tuti Bridge in Khartoum is considered to be the first suspension bridge to be constructed in Sudan and one of the first constructed in Africa . The concept design of the bridge was proposed by Alfatih Ahmed , with the final working design by A&A Company Its construction depended on new bridge technology , enabling the erection to be carried out using local expertise & equipment . The Tuti - Kartoum Bridge is the first among a series of bridges that will connect the cities of Khartoum , Omdurman and Bahri ( North Khartoum ) , and will help to alleviate traffic throughout the cities . The development has immediately commercialized the previously isolated Tuti Island . - Lake Victoria (' in Luo; ' in Luganda; \\"\\" in Kinyarwanda and some Bantu languages) is one of the African Great Lakes. The lake was named after Queen Victoria by the explorer John Hanning Speke, the first Briton to document it. Speke accomplished this in 1858, while on an expedition with Richard Francis Burton to locate the source of the Nile River. - Omdurman (standard \\"Umm Durmn\\") is the largest city in Sudan and Khartoum State, lying on the western banks of the River Nile, opposite the capital, Khartoum. Omdurman has a population of 2,395,159 (2008) and is the national centre of commerce. With Khartoum and Khartoum North or Bahri, it forms the cultural and industrial heart of the nation. - The White Nile (\\"\\") is a river of Africa, one of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the other being the Blue Nile. - Khartoum is the capital and second largest city of Sudan and Khartoum state. It is located at the confluence of the White Nile, flowing north from Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile, flowing west from Ethiopia. The location where the two Niles meet is known as \\"\\"al-Mogran\\"\\" , meaning the confluence. The main Nile continues to flow north towards Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Khartoum North or Bahri (\\"al-Kharm Bar\\") is the third-largest city in the Republic of Sudan. It is located on the east bank of the Blue Nile near its confluence with the White and bridges connect it with Khartoum to its south and Omdurman to its west. - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River. - Sudan (\\"as-Sdn\\", ), also known as North Sudan and officially the Republic of the Sudan (\\"Jumhriyyat as-Sdn\\"), is a country in Northern Africa. It is bordered by Egypt to the north, the Red Sea, Eritrea, and Ethiopia to the east, South Sudan to the south, the Central African Republic to the southwest, Chad to the west and Libya to the northwest. It is the third largest country in Africa. The River Nile divides the country into eastern and western halves. Before the Sudanese Civil War, South Sudan was part of Sudan but broke away in 2011. Its predominant religion is Islam. - The Blue Nile (transliterated: Abbay but pronounced \\"Abbai\\", \\"\\") is a river originating at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. With the White Nile, the river becomes one of the two major tributaries of the Nile. The upper course of the river is called the Abbay in Ethiopia, where many regard it as holy. Some Ethiopians have long identified the Blue Nile as the River Gihon mentioned as flowing out of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2 and \\"encircling the entire land of Cush\\".

The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family. This film delivers. This is a layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to 'No Country For Old Men.' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills, 'Devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The acting delivers as well. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings the jitters, sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged Hank.

Answer this question: when does elena and damon end up together??","completion":"Elena Gilbert and Damon Salvatore, two main characters from the popular supernatural television series \\"The Vampire Diaries,\\" end up together at various points throughout the show. However, it is essential to note that their relationship is complicated, marked by various ups and downs, and evolves significantly as the series progresses. To provide a detailed answer, we must venture into spoiler territory. If you have not completed watching the series, be aware that the following information will reveal key plot points. Initially, the series focused on the relationship between Elena and Damon's younger brother, Stefan. As the story unfolds, though, Elena and Damon's dynamic shifts from one of animosity and mistrust to friendship, eventually culminating in romantic feelings for one another. The central love triangle between Elena, Stefan, and Damon is a persistent theme throughout the series. Elena and Damon first acknowledge and explore their romantic feelings in season 3. After an emotional breakthrough, they share their first kiss in the episode titled \\"The New Deal.\\" However, it is essential to remember that Elena is still in a relationship with Stefan at this point, and Damon and Elena do not truly become a couple until later in the series. Their relationship intensifies and comes to the forefront in season 4, particularly as a consequence of Elena turning into a vampire. After experiencing a series of vivid hallucinations during her transition, Elena realizes that her feelings for Damon have deepened and decides to break up with Stefan. In the episode \\"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street,\\" Elena finally succumbs to her feelings and shares an intimate moment with Damon, marking the official beginning of their romantic relationship. Elena and Damon's love story is not without its challenges, though. They face external and internal conflicts, including supernatural threats and personal struggles, that test their commitment to each other. One such obstacle arises in the form of the sire bond, a mystical connection established when a vampire turns a human, often leading to the human developing intense loyalty and adoration for their sire. Suspicions that their love might not be genuine due to the sire bond cast a shadow over their relationship. Season 5 sees multiple trials and tribulations, including Katherine's interference and the introduction of the doppelganger prophecy. However, Elena and Damon's love is unwavering, consistently overcoming the challenges thrown their way. The season concludes on a tragic note as Damon is trapped on the Other Side, a realm for supernatural beings who have died but not yet moved on, following the disintegration of the Other Side in the season finale. By the beginning of season 6, Elena struggles to cope with Damon's supposed death and ultimately decides to compel herself to forget her love for him. In a twist of fate, Damon manages to escape the Other Side and reunite with Elena. Regrettably, due to her compelled memory loss, Elena only sees him as the malicious vampire he once was. Despite this, their love ultimately triumphs, and Elena regains her memories by the season's end. The turning point in their relationship takes place at the end of season 6. When Elena is mistakenly presumed dead, reality reveals that her life is now magically linked to Bonnie's. Elena remains in a magically-induced coma that will only end once Bonnie dies. This predicament forces Damon and Elena to part ways––Elena's life is paused, and Damon must continue living a life without her. The finale of season 8––the final season of \\"The Vampire Diaries\\"––provides a resolution to Elena and Damon's story. In the last episode, \\"I Was Feeling Epic,\\" Bonnie severs the supernatural link, allowing Elena to wake from her coma. After reuniting with her friends and family, she shares an emotional reunion with Damon. With Stefan's sacrifice to save everyone (and his instruction to Damon to spend a human life with Elena), the Salvatore brothers' conflict finally ends. At this point, Damon takes the cure for vampirism and becomes human. He and Elena can finally share a life together without the complexities and challenges brought on by their supernatural existence. The series concludes with a scene revealing that Elena and Damon enjoyed a long and fulfilling human life, surrounded by love and happiness. They eventually rejoin their loved ones in the afterlife, providing a satisfying and heartfelt conclusion to their epic love story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you don't know where to begin, ask yourself what moments you enjoyed and what moments you didn't enjoy in your day. Look at what emotions contributed to each situation. Meditation can be as simple as learning to listen to your breathing. It's taking a step back from the world, taking your focus from your stress and relaxing your body. For instance, one type of meditation involves repeating a mantra over and over. A mantra is a short word or phrase that helps focus the mind, such as \\"om.\\" However, your mantra can be whatever you want. Concentrate on letting your thoughts go, concentrating on repeating that phrase over and over. Hobbies such as knitting or even solving jigsaw puzzles help you step away from your emotions. They are like meditation in that way, helping you clear your mind. Exercise is a great way to manage stress. For one, you get lost in the motion, and it becomes a form of meditation, helping you forget what's wrong. In addition, it ups your endorphins, which make you feel better about life. Aim for 150 minutes of aerobic activity a week, if you're exercising moderately. Sometimes, it's not you. Sometimes, it's the people you hang out with. The next time you find yourself in a situation where someone makes you feel hurt, tell that person. You can't make the situation better if you don't say something. It may be hard to get the words out, but the words don't need to be anything special. All you have to say is, \\"What you [did or said] hurt me, and I would appreciate it if you don't do it again.\\" If you're constantly feeling put-down by the people around you, you may need to get new friends. Of course, give the people around you a chance to change. However, if they repeatedly hurt you, maybe it's time to find some new friends.

What is the solution?","completion":"Let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're putting a puzzle together. We have this equation: 80 = 18*l - 20*l + 18*l We can think of each \\"l\\" as a toy block and the numbers in front (18, -20, and 18) are telling us how many toy blocks we have in each group. So, we have three groups of toy blocks here: 1. First group has 18 toy blocks. 2. Second group needs to take away 20 toy blocks (that's why it's -20). 3. Third group has 18 more toy blocks to add. Now, let's add and subtract these toy blocks: (18 - 20) + 18 -2 + 18 (Because if we have 18 and take away 20, we're short by 2) 16 (When we add the -2 and the 18, we get 16) So, the total number of toy blocks is 16. Now we can write: 80 = 16 * l (80 equals 16 blocks times \\"l\\") To find out how many times (l) the 16 blocks can fit in 80, we'll divide 80 by 16: 80 ÷ 16 = 5 This means that \\"l\\" or the number of times the groups of 16 fit in 80 is 5.

Write an article based on this summary: See your doctor for a diagnosis if you suspect anemia. Consult with your doctor before trying supplements.","completion":"Title: Recognizing Anemia: When to Seek Medical Diagnosis and the Importance of Consultation Before Taking Supplements Introduction Anemia is a prevalent medical condition where your body has insufficient healthy red blood cells to supply the required oxygen to your body's tissues. Feeling fatigued and weak is a common indication of anemia. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of anemia can go unnoticed or be mistaken for other medical conditions. Therefore, it is essential to see your doctor for a diagnosis if you suspect anemia. Additionally, consulting with your healthcare provider is crucial before taking any supplements to avoid complications. Recognizing the Symptoms of Anemia The first step to addressing anemia is recognizing the signs and symptoms. Common anemia symptoms include: 1. Fatigue 2. Weakness 3. Pale skin 4. Shortness of breath 5. Irregular heartbeat 6. Dizziness or lightheadedness 7. Chest pain 8. Cold hands and feet 9. Headaches 10. Cognitive problems Many of these symptoms can also be associated with other medical conditions, making it crucial to consult with a medical professional for a proper diagnosis. Importance of Medical Diagnosis and Evaluation If you suspect you might be suffering from anemia, it is essential to schedule an appointment with your doctor. During your visit, your healthcare provider will review your medical history, ask about your symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. In most cases, your doctor will request blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), to determine the presence of anemia. The blood tests will also enable your doctor to identify the type of anemia, as there are several forms of the condition, such as iron-deficiency, vitamin-deficiency, hemolytic, sickle cell, and aplastic anemia. Each type has its causes and treatments, which is why proper diagnosis is vital. Consulting with Your Doctor Before Trying Supplements Many types of anemia are caused by nutrient deficiencies, such as low levels of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid. However, it is essential not to self-diagnose or self-treat your symptoms with over-the-counter supplements. Not all anemia cases are caused by nutrient deficiencies, and consuming supplements without consulting your doctor can cause further health complications. For example, iron overload is a dangerous condition that can occur if you take iron supplements without needing them. Iron overload can damage your liver, heart, and other organs, resulting in severe health issues. Moreover, even if your doctor confirms that your anemia is caused by a deficiency, you will need guidance on the proper dosage and duration of supplementation. Your doctor may recommend a specific supplement and dosage based on laboratory test results and your individual needs. In addition, your healthcare provider will monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Conclusion Anemia can negatively impact your quality of life if left unaddressed. If you suspect that you are suffering from anemia, it is crucial to seek a medical diagnosis to determine the root cause and appropriate treatment plan. Remember to consult with your healthcare provider before taking any supplements, as they may not be suitable for your specific condition and could lead to further complications. With professional guidance and a tailored treatment plan, you can effectively manage anemia and reclaim your health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Use the following highlights to write an article: NEW: U.S. Secretary of State Clinton says U.S. has no plans to shoot rocket down. N. Korea positions what analyst is believes is long-range missile for launch. Taepodong 2 rocket could launch either a warhead or a satellite. North Koreans have said they intend to launch a communications satellite.","completion":"Title: North Korea Prepares Long-Range Missile Test Amid Global Concerns The United States has reaffirmed its stance of not interrupting North Korea's missile tests despite global concerns and tensions escalating in the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. Secretary of State, Clinton, announced recently that the United States has no plans to shoot down the long-range missile that North Korea is positioning for launch. The statement comes as satellite images and expert analysis show that Pyongyang is preparing for a highly anticipated test of its Taepodong 2 rocket, fueling concerns among its neighbors and the international community. Intelligence analysts believe that the Taepodong 2 rocket, which is being positioned by North Korea, is capable of launching either a warhead or a satellite into space. North Korean authorities have insisted that their intention is to launch a communications satellite into orbit as part of their space program. However, skepticism remains high among the international community due to the secretive nature of the North Korean regime and the possibility that the test might be a cover for developing long-range missile technology. The prospect of a rocket launch by North Korea has sparked widespread concern amongst its neighbors, particularly South Korea and Japan, who consider such tests as potential threats to regional security. They argue that North Korea's continued pursuit of ballistic missile technology is a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which prohibit the country from developing missile technologies. The U.S. stance of not actively engaging to shoot down the rocket comes as a relief for some, but it does little to quell the fears and tensions in the region. Despite the assurances from North Korea that the purpose of the impending rocket launch is peaceful, many experts remain unconvinced. They argue that the country's track record of using deceptive tactics to conceal the development of its nuclear program raises serious doubts about the transparency of its intentions. Furthermore, North Korea has failed to provide any concrete evidence to back up its claims that the rocket is being prepared for the sole purpose of launching a communications satellite. This lack of transparency has fueled speculation that the test could be a front for advancing North Korea's ballistic missile capabilities. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Taepodong 2 rocket remains an untested and potentially unreliable technology, with previous attempts at launching the missile ending in failure. This raises questions about the accuracy of the missile and the safety of the launch. Should the missile veer off course, it could pose a significant risk to surrounding countries, particularly those in the flight path, such as Japan. As the world's attention focuses on North Korea and the launch of its Taepodong 2 rocket, it remains to be seen whether the true nature of this missile test will be for peaceful purposes or if it is another step in developing the country's nuclear arsenal. The international community is likely to closely monitor the situation and prepare for any potential repercussions. However, for now, the U.S. government's decision not to shoot down the rocket demonstrates a cautious approach to a highly delicate and complex geopolitical issue. In conclusion, the recent developments involving North Korea's Taepodong 2 rocket have heightened tensions in the Korean Peninsula and raised several concerns for regional security. Despite assurances from both the North Korean government and the U.S. Secretary of State, the true intentions behind this rocket launch remain cloaked in uncertainty. Regardless of the outcome, the situation highlights the ongoing complexities of international politics and emphasizes the importance of diplomacy and dialogue in addressing - and potentially resolving - such tensions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The virus is a variant of the virus malaria created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and a particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold.

It has lots of pictures, diagrams, and examples.The one negative, and it isn't really a negative, is that the authors are from the UK, so Americans won't be as familiar with some of the examples (e.g. Tony Blair, the Beckhams, etc).Good book.

Конотопская битва Translate to English English:","completion":"The Battle of Konotop The Battle of Konotop, also known as the Battle of Sosnivka, took place on June 29, 1659 near the town of Konotop in the present-day Sumy Oblast of Ukraine. This battle was one of the most significant military engagements during the Russo-Polish War, which lasted from 1654 to 1676. Here is a little more insight into the battle: Background: The battle was primarily fought between the allied forces of the Ukrainian Cossacks, who were led by the hetman of Left-bank Ukraine, Ivan Vyhovsky, and the Crimean Tatars, led by their Khan Mehmed IV Giray, against the Tsardom of Russia, led by the tsar Alexei Mikhailovich. The Russo-Polish War was the backdrop of this conflict, a war that was initiated owing to unresolved disputes between Russia and Poland, and the desire of the Tsardom of Russia to extort land from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Battle: The allied forces of the Cossacks and Crimean Tatars decided to take advantage of Russia's preoccupations during the complex war with Poland, expressing their discontent against Moscow dominance. This led to the events of the Battle of Konotop, as the allied forces confronted a large Russian army near the town of Konotop. The Ukrainian Cossacks utilized their local knowledge to lay well-planned traps and ambushes, showing remarkable military strategy and acumen, which played a significant role in their success. Outcome: The battle of Konotop ended with a decisive victory for the allied forces of the Ukrainian Cossacks and the Crimean Tatars. The battle resulted in significant casualties for the Russian army, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the allied forces. However, despite the victory, due to political complexities and ongoing disputes, Hetman Vyhovsky's attempts to extricate Ukraine from Russian influence and establish closer ties with Poland didn't succeed in long term. Importance: The Battle of Konotop is often held up as one of the most significant military victories of the Ukrainian Cossacks. It also marked a pivotal moment of defiance against the Russian influence, displaying the Ukrainian desire for autonomy and affirming their military prowess. Despite the fact that it didn't lead to long-term changes in the political alignment of Ukraine, the Battle of Konotop remains a symbol of Ukrainian resistance and tactical acumen. The effects of this battle were far-reaching, not just in terms of military strategy, but also geopolitical relations and the subsequent progression of the Russo-Polish War. This historical event still holds relevance in studying the complex relations between Ukraine, Russia, and Poland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And I was wondering How would Jesse feel afterwards? A:","completion":"Based on the information that Jesse was harassed by someone on the bus, Jesse would most likely feel \\"2) targeted and at risk on the bus.\\" Experiencing harassment can evoke a wide range of emotions and reactions in a person. Jesse, in this situation, might have felt vulnerable, uncomfortable, or threatened upon encountering the harasser on the bus. Because public transportation is generally a shared space for diverse individuals, Jesse could have initially expected a safe and non-confrontational experience. However, the harassment incident would likely have shattered this expectation, leading to feelings of danger, discomfort, and unease throughout the rest of the bus journey. Moreover, as a consequence of feeling targeted and at risk, Jesse's trust in the bus as a secure means of transportation might have suffered. The harassment could have resulted in both short-term and long-term psychological effects on Jesse, such as heightened anxiety, a lingering sense of vulnerability, and an aversion to using public transport. These emotions can persist or resurface in similar contexts or situations, serving as uncomfortable reminders of the harassment Jesse endured. Apart from the internal emotional turmoil, Jesse may also feel a lack of support or safety from others on the bus. If no fellow passengers or the bus driver intervened or offered assistance during the harassment, Jesse could feel even more isolated and exposed. This lack of support potentially amplifies Jesse's sense of vulnerability and distrust in the environment, creating an even more negative aftermath. Consequently, the harassment Jesse experienced on the bus would make them feel targeted and at risk. This feeling would not only affect their emotional state and perception of safety during that specific bus ride but could also have lasting repercussions on their overall attitude towards public transportation, trust in others, and emotional well-being in such settings."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Occurring just two days after the grave injury of Jonah Shacknai's young son while in her care, a dark cloud of doubt persists as Zahau's family and supporters continue their push for a deeper investigation into the eventful and heartbreaking series of events that transpired at Jonah Shacknai's California mansion. Rebecca Zahau, originally from Burma, was found dead at the Spreckels Mansion, which belonged to her boyfriend, pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai. The 32-year-old was discovered naked with her hands tied behind her back - her feet were bound, and a rope was tied around her neck, hanging her from a second-story balcony. The official cause of death was declared as suicide, but her family, friends, and many others in the community find it difficult to believe that Zahau took her life in such a manner. The tragic death of Zahau was acutely complicated by the additional tragedy of Max Shacknai, Jonah's 6-year-old son, who, just 48 hours prior to Rebecca's death, had suffered a severe brain injury after falling down a staircase at the Spreckels Mansion. The young boy, unresponsive upon discovery, was cared for by Zahau at the time of the accident. He was immediately taken to the hospital and placed on life support but eventually succumbed to his injuries despite intensive medical intervention. The timing of these two devastating events has led to significant suspicion throughout the community and among media outlets. In light of the questions surrounding Rebecca's death, Jonah Shacknai has expressed his hope for a review that will bring clarity and \\"confidence\\" to the closed suicide case. He has stated that the primary goal is to have definitive answers for all involved parties, particularly the families affected by the tragedies. A thorough and transparent examination of the case would aid in consolation for those who have lost their dear ones and allow them to begin healing from their grief. Despite the urging of Zahau's family to reopen the case, there are also those who remain skeptical about the possible involvement of a third party in her death. Critics suggest that Rebecca's state of duress following Max's accident may have contributed to her decision to take her life in an elaborate and bizarre manner. Nevertheless, without concrete evidence connecting the two incidents, speculation continues to pose unanswered questions that the original investigation left unresolved. Both in the United Kingdom and the United States, numerous support resources are available for individuals struggling with suicidal ideation, such as the Samaritans and the National Suicide Prevention Line. These organizations offer confidential services for people in need of immediate assistance and a listening ear, working tirelessly to prevent further tragedies.

In the United States, the National Suicide Prevention Line can be reached at 1-800-273-8255. In conclusion, the mysterious death of Rebecca Zahau remains a topic of discussion and concern nearly a decade after the tragic incident. Despite the suicide ruling, her family's appeal for a reexamination of the case highlights the need for thorough investigations and transparency. Ensuring that every aspect of cases like these is examined is crucial in restoring the public's trust and providing the much-needed closure to families who have lost their loved ones to inexplicable circumstances."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand. Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory, and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and are almost poisoned themselves. Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually destroyed by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake. After that Dr. Hill predicts the next quake will happen at the San Andreas fault, which would wipe out the West Coast in its present shape killing 50 million people on the way. Dr. Hill hypothesizes that they could \\"weld\\" the fault shut by letting it experience immense heat, which could only be created with nuclear bombs. Part 2[edit] The President after some deliberation follows Nolan's advice to execute Dr. HillÂ´s plan and allows the placement of the nuclear warheads. Additionally he gives the order to evacuate the entire West Coast in case it fails and mobilizes all resources available for it. Five of the six nuclear bombs have been successfully installed, but during...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. By James Forsyth The morning after Ed Miliband’s conference speech, David Cameron and his speechwriting team gathered at Chequers. The Prime Minister was in bullish mood. Unlike several of his Cabinet colleagues, he wasn’t overly concerned by Miliband’s raid on ‘One Nation’ Tory territory. He joked: ‘It’s impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes; it’s even more impressive to give a speech for 70 minutes without notes and not say anything.’ Cameron’s crack is typical of his new attitude. The Prime Minister has finally heeded the pleas of many of his closest allies and made himself and his Downing Street operation more political.","completion":"Task: Analyze the text and provide a summary along with my thoughts on the statement. Step 1: Read and understand the text The text discusses a meeting between David Cameron and his speechwriting team after listening to Ed Miliband's conference speech. Cameron is not bothered by Miliband's discussion of 'One Nation' Tory territory and makes a joke about the speech's lack of substance. The text also mentions that Cameron has grown more political in his approach as Downing Street Prime Minister. Step 2: Identify key points - David Cameron meets with speechwriting team after Ed Miliband's conference speech - Cameron not overly concerned about Miliband's discussion of 'One Nation' Tory territory - Cameron makes a joke about the lack of substance in Miliband's speech - Cameron is becoming more political as Downing Street Prime Minister Step 3: Summarize the key points After listening to Ed Miliband's conference speech, David Cameron convened with his speechwriting team and showed a lack of concern regarding Miliband's discussion of 'One Nation' Tory territory. Instead, Cameron joked about the speech's absence of meaningful content. Additionally, Cameron has started to become more political during his time as Downing Street Prime Minister. Step 4: Provide my thoughts on the statement It is interesting to see how political leaders react to speeches from their opponents. David Cameron's response to Ed Miliband's speech shows that he is not threatened by the opposition. Also, the fact that Cameron is becoming more political indicates that he is adapting to his role as Prime Minister, possibly to better address the political climate and the expectations from his party and the public."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The given text is a poetic description of how nature works with the process of seed burial and growth. It talks about the sequence of events that occur in the natural world - first, the frost strikes, causing the plants to wilt and drop their seeds. Then, the rains arrive, and their raindrops act like enormous tears falling from the sky. These raindrops bury the flower seeds deeper into the earth. The rhythmic tapping of the raindrops could possibly pummel the seeds further, driving them an inch or two underground.

Would patient B be shorter or taller than patient D? David is a physician with the children's hospital. He is seeing four patients, patient A, patient B, patient C, and patient D. Patient A is a male with Klinefelter's syndrome. Patient B is female with Turner syndrome. Patient C is a male and does not have any of these illnesses. Patient D is a female and she too does not have any of these illnesses. Hint: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, patient B would be shorter than patient D. Patient B is a female with Turner syndrome, while patient D is a female without any of the mentioned illnesses. Turner syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by the absence or alteration of one of the X chromosomes in a female's cells. This missing genetic material impacts development, leading to distinct features such as short stature and infertility. Consequently, females with Turner syndrome tend to have shorter heights when compared to their unaffected peers. In contrast, patient D does not have any of these genetic conditions, which indicates that her growth and development would be considered within the normal range. As Turner syndrome is specifically associated with short stature and patient D is not affected by any of these conditions, it can be concluded that patient B (with Turner syndrome) would be shorter than patient D (without any genetic illnesses)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The offer wings, chicken tenders (fried or grilled) and nuggets. They said that their crispy tenders are their most popular item so I gave them a try along with the Goat Island Delight salad they said was their best - a salad with craisins, almonds and champagne vinegarette. They seem to do a big business from the hospitals at lunch and their food comes out ultra quickly which is good if you're on the go. They seem to do a good job with training their employees. I just wasn't crazy about the breading/seasoning on the chicken- it tasted a little bland/sour and when you say crispy, I guess I expected more crispy batter ala KFC on the outside and the batter was quite thin. The accompanying sauces named after various South Carolina places were boring (buffalo, jerk, bourbon, honey mustard, etc.) The best was the Old Edisto sweet honey BBQ sauce. The salad was bland without the dressing but the dressing itself didn't complement the salad at all. The saving grace of the meal was the delicious cornbread which was sweet and moist, and the frozen banana pudding pop in a dixie cup with caramel and chocolate, which incidentally is not a good thing to eat while driving.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Mike was visiting the African Savannah. One animal that interested him most was the African Buffalo. He noticed that the buffaloes would usually live in a large herd, often exceeding few hundreds. He noted that as case A. But sometimes the buffaloes would live in a small herd. He noted that as case B. Interestingly, there are incidents when an aggressive male buffalo would live by itself. He noted that as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In case A, would the group get less or more benefit as a whole than in case B? Hint: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases. A:","completion":"In case A, where the African Buffaloes live in a large herd often exceeding a few hundred individuals, the group would likely experience more benefits as a whole compared to case B, where the buffaloes live in a smaller herd. The primary reason for this is the concept of the dilution effect, as hinted at in the supplementary information provided. The dilution effect posits that when animals aggregate in large groups, each individual member of the group faces a reduced risk of predation. This occurs as each individual forms just one small part of the entire group, making it harder for predators to single out and target an individual. In essence, the risk of attack is spread out, or \\"diluted,\\" among all members of the group. This can deter predators from attacking large groups due to increased difficulty and might even increase the likelihood of a predator choosing a smaller group or solitary individual as its target. The examples provided from the text, such as the shoaling of fish, Camargue horses in Southern France, and water striders, all demonstrate the dilution effect's impact on reducing individual attack rates as group size increases. This indicates that group living evolved as a protective strategy to provide benefits to individuals and enhance their chances of survival. Applying the dilution effect to the African Buffalo, it becomes clear that a larger herd (case A) provides more significant benefits to its members compared to a smaller herd (case B). In case A, each buffalo in the large herd has a diminished risk of predation due to the group size, making it a safer environment for individual buffaloes. However, in case B, the smaller herd size offers less protection to individual buffaloes, as the dilution effect is less pronounced, which implies they will have a higher individual risk of attack compared to buffaloes in larger herds. It is essential to note that while the group as a whole experiences more significant benefits from living in a large herd, the primary driver for such group formation is the survival advantage it offers to each individual buffalo. Simply put, an individual buffalo is less likely to be targeted by a predator if it is part of a large group, making large herd living an advantageous strategy for self-preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I climbed the ladder, heard my dive announced, and began the moves that would push me into the air. Pushing off the diving board with my legs, I lifted my arms and shoulders back, and knew immediately I would be close to the board and might hit my hands. I tried to correct myself as I turned, spreading my hands wide apart. Then I heard a strange sound and my body lost control. Moments later I realized I had hit my head on the board. At the beginning, I felt embarrassed. I wanted to hide, to get out of the pool without anyone seeing me. Next I felt intense fear. Had I cut my head? Was I bleeding? Was there blood in the pool? Swimming to the side, I noticed many shocked faces. People were worried about my head; I was worried about something far more threatening. An official examined my head. In a hurry, I pushed him away, and everyone else who approached me. \\"Don't touch me!\\" I felt like screaming. \\"Get away from me!\\" These were the trials for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, Korea. Until this dive, I had been ahead. But now, something else was more significant than winning. I might have endangered other divers' lives if I had spilled blood in the pool. For what I knew--- that few others knew - was that I was HIV-positive. According to my mother, my natural parents were Samoan and only teenagers when I was born, so they gave me up for adoption. When I was only eighteen months old, I started gym classes. At ten, I explored doing gym exercises off the diving board at the pool. Because of my dark skin, kids at school called me names. My diving made me feel good about myself when my peers made me feel stupid. At sixteen, I knew I had a shot at the 1976 Olympics. Everyone was alarmed when I hit my head on the board in Seoul. Regardless, I made it to the finals. During my last dive in the finals, I enjoyed for the last time the quietness underwater and then swam to the side of the pool.

Hi, little friends! Today, we are going to learn about two super cool ways to talk in Spanish. They are called the \\"present subjunctive\\" and \\"perfect subjunctive\\" tenses. I promise we're going to make it easy and fun! The Present Subjunctive: First, let's start with the \\"present subjunctive.\\" Subjunctive is just a fancy name for a way we talk when we are not so sure about something or how we wish things are in the world. For example, imagine your friend Emma has a big test tomorrow. You want to tell her, \\"I hope you pass the exam!\\" In Spanish, we would say, \\"¡Espero que apruebes el examen!\\" The word \\"apruebes\\" is the present subjunctive form of the verb \\"aprobar\\" (to pass). Did you notice that we're not 100% sure if Emma will pass, but we hope she does? That's the subjunctive in action! The Perfect Subjunctive: Now, let's go to the \\"perfect subjunctive\\" tense. Just like its friend, the present subjunctive, the perfect subjunctive is also a way to talk when we're not sure about something. But this time, we're talking about things that happened before. You know, like when you finished your ice cream last week? Yep, that's a past action! To use the perfect subjunctive, we need to make a special recipe! First, we need a \\"helping verb\\" called \\"haber.\\" Haber helps us to talk about things that we did before. Then, we mix it with the word \\"sido.\\" \\"Sido\\" is a part of the verb \\"ser\\" (to be) and can also mean \\"been\\" in English. Now, let's see this recipe in action! Imagine you want to say, \\"I wish you had been to the zoo.\\" In Spanish, we'd say, \\"Ojalá hubieras ido al zoológico.\\" The word \\"hubieras\\" is the perfect subjunctive form of the verb \\"haber.\\" And \\"ido\\" is the past participle of the verb \\"ir\\" (to go), which is combined with \\"hubieras\\" to express the action in the past. You see? We used \\"haber\\" and \\"sido\\" to create a super-cool perfect subjunctive sentence! So, that's it! Now, you've learned about two amazing ways to talk when you're not so sure about something. Remember, the present subjunctive helps you talk about things right now, and the perfect subjunctive helps you talk about things before. They might sound a little tricky, but with practice, you'll become a subjunctive superstar! Happy learning, little friends!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Bengals started off the scoring in the first quarter when Randy Bullock kicked a 23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. The Steelers tied it up when Chris Boswell nailed a 45-yard field goal, leaving the score at 3-3, but the Bengals regained the lead late in the first quarter on Andy Dalton's 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 10-3.

Choose the next sentence.(CNN) -- India has overtaken China as the world's biggest importer of weapons, with Asian nations the most aggressive consumers of military hardware, a new report says. Between 2007 and 2011, India's business accounted for 10% of the global arms market, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). South Korea was next, accounting for 6% of sales, followed by Pakistan and China (5%) and Singapore (4%). Siemon Wezeman, a senior analyst with SIPRI, said India's defense spending reflects its regional security concerns and Delhi's global aspirations. \\"India procures arms in relation to its tense relationship with Pakistan and increasingly sees China as a potential threat,\\" he told CNN. \\"It also wants to assert itself as a major regional or even global power.\\" Meanwhile, OPTIONS: - Asian's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - CNN's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - China's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - Delhi's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - India's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - Pakistan's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - SIPRI's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - Siemon Wezeman's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - Singapore's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - South Korea's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program. - Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program.","completion":"China's relative decline as an arms importer comes at a time when it is increasing its overall defense budget, investing in major projects such as the development of a stealth fighter jet and an aircraft carrier program.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 5 + 2 = 7*r for r. What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like we're talking to a five-year-old. We have this equation: 5 + 2 = 7*r First, let's add 5 and 2 together. When we have 5 fingers on one hand and 2 fingers on the other hand, we get a total of 7 fingers. So now our equation looks like this: 7 = 7*r Now, we want to find out what number \\"r\\" is. To do this, we need to make \\"r\\" alone on one side of the equation. We know that 7*r means 7 times a certain number (which is r). To get r by itself, we should do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 7, like this: 7 ÷ 7 = (7 * r) ÷ 7 When we divide 7 by 7, we get 1. So now the equation looks like this: 1 = r So in this math problem, the solution is r = 1. This means the number \\"r\\" is 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Palermo Palermo experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csa). Winters are cool and wet, while summers are hot and dry. Temperatures in autumn and spring are usually mild. Palermo is one of the warmest cities in Europe (mainly due to its warm nights), with an average annual air temperature of 18.5 °C (65.3 °F). It receives approximately 2,530 hours of sunshine per year. Snow is usually a rare occurrence, but it does occur occasionally if there is a cold front, as the Apennines are too distant to protect the island from cold winds blowing from the Balkans, and the mountains surrounding the city facilite the formation of snow accumulation in Palermo, especially at night. Between the 1940s and the 2000s there have been eleven times when considerable snowfall has occurred: In 1949, in 1956, when the minimum temperature went down to 0 °C (32 °F) and the city was blanketed by several centimeters of snow. Snow also occurred in 1999, 2009 and 2015. The average annual temperature of the sea is above 19 °C (66 °F); from 14 °C (57 °F) in February to 26 °C (79 °F) in August. In the period from May to November, the average sea temperature exceeds 18 °C (64 °F) and in the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds 21 °C (70 °F). Q: How do Palermo's temperatures compare to the rest of Europe?","completion":"Palermo, located on the island of Sicily in southern Italy, is one of the warmest cities in Europe. Its average annual air temperature sits at around 18.5°C (65.3°F), which sets it apart from many other European cities. For comparison, the average annual temperature for London, United Kingdom, is around 11°C (51.8°F), and for Paris, France, it's roughly around 12.3°C (54.1°F). During the summer period of June to August, Palermo experiences hot and dry weather with temperatures often above 30°C (86°F). This is exemplar of a typical Mediterranean summer climate. The rest of Europe, particularly northern and central regions, do not generally reach such high temperatures, with average summer highs for many cities in countries like Germany, France, and the UK ranging from about 20°C (68°F) to the mid-20s°C (77°F) which are cooler than Palermo's averages. Winter in Palermo is relatively mild, with temperatures infrequently dropping to around freezing. Snow is rare, usually occurring only under certain conditions such as a cold front from the Balkans. This contrasts strongly with the typical winter climates in much of northern, eastern, and even some parts of central Europe, such as Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Russia, that frequently see cold temperatures and substantial snowfall. It's also important to note that Palermo's sea temperature, which averages above 19°C (66°F) annually, is notably warmer than that of many coastal areas in Europe. For example, the North Sea, which borders the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Scandinavia, averages around 17°C (63°F) at its warmest in August and drops to around 6–10°C (43–50°F) in the winter months. In conclusion, compared to much of Europe, Palermo's climate is quite warm, reflecting its southern Mediterranean location. Even in winter, Palermo generally exhibits milder conditions than much cooler climates seen in northern and central European regions. One of the main reasons for this is the city's geographic position, which allows it to benefit from relatively hot sea temperatures and warm winds coming from northern Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who suffered heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971? from the following article ? In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence...

A paraphrase is a restatement of a text or a passage using different words without altering the meaning. Let us closely examine each sentence to understand the distinction.

This sentence implies that the primary or most important (predominant) sector, which also happens to have a secondary occupation of the building, employs 33% of the workers. The focus is on the primary sector, which has an additional function related to the building. Sentence 2: The secondary sector, with a predominant occupation of the building, employs 33% of workers. Here, the sentence is talking about the secondary sector, which is not the main or most important sector. However, it has a predominant occupation of the building, meaning that it is the most prominent or main activity related to the building. This secondary sector employs 33% of workers.

Oranges have a high water content (around 87% water) and contain important electrolytes, like potassium, that help with hydration and muscle function. Consuming an orange during a workout can help replenish fluids and electrolytes lost through sweat. Eating a carrot cake is not the best option for staying hydrated during a workout. Carrot cake has a much lower water content than an orange and is typically high in calories, fat, and sugar.

Give me the correct facts to answer this: what language do haitian speak? Answer:","completion":"Haitians predominantly speak two languages, Haitian Creole and French. Here is a detailed and long answer to provide a comprehensive understanding of the languages spoken in Haiti. 1. Haitian Creole (Kreyòl Ayisyen) Haitian Creole is the most widely spoken language in Haiti, used by approximately 95-100% of the population. It is a creole language that was developed as a result of interactions between African slaves and French colonizers during the 17th and 18th centuries. Haitian Creole is based primarily on French, but it also includes influences from West African languages, Portuguese, Spanish, and indigenous Caribbean languages such as Taíno and Arawak. Haitian Creole is not a dialect of French; it is a separate language with its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Although it shares some similarities with French, Haitian Creole has evolved to incorporate its unique linguistic features. It uses a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, just like English and French. However, its grammar is often considered more straightforward, with a less complex system of tenses and conjugations. Over time, Haitian Creole has become the primary means of communication among Haitians, transcending social and economic barriers. It is the language of daily life, education, and mass media. In 1987, Haitian Creole was recognized as an official language of Haiti alongside French, which has led to an increase in its presence in the education system and governmental institutions. 2. French French was the official and dominant language in Haiti during the period of French colonization, which began in the late 17th century. After Haiti gained its independence in 1804, French continued to be the language of government, education, and the upper-class Haitians. In present-day Haiti, French is co-official with Haitian Creole, as mentioned earlier. Although French is an official language in Haiti, it is estimated that only around 5-10% of the population can speak it fluently. The use of French is often associated with socio-economic status, as those who can speak it are typically from more privileged backgrounds. French is primarily used in formal settings, such as government institutions, legal documents, higher education, and literature. The educational system in Haiti has traditionally been strongly influenced by the French model. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards incorporating more Haitian Creole in schools, allowing broader access to education. This change recognizes the importance of teaching and learning in a student's native language in order to promote comprehension, critical thinking, and creativity. In conclusion, the primary language spoken in Haiti is Haitian Creole, with French serving as a co-official language used mainly in formal contexts. Since both languages have their roots in French but have evolved in different ways, understanding the linguistic complexities of both Haitian Creole and French is essential to understanding Haitian culture, history, and society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of Tchaikovsky's former teacher? is inside the article: As The Five's campaign against Rubinstein continued in the press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation cantata and lambasted the composer as \\"utterly feeble.... If he had any talent at all ... it would surely at some point in the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory.\\" The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in Romeo and Juliet. The Five's approval of this work was further followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. Subtitled the Little Russian (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the Ukraine) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's The Tempest to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a tone poem based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, composed to a program after Lord Byron originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"The name of Tchaikovsky's former teacher is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the teacher is Anton Rubinstein, as the text discusses \\"The Five's campaign against Rubinstein\\" and refers to Tchaikovsky as being targeted \\"almost as much as his former teacher.\\" So the answer is Anton Rubinstein."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: According to the latest research in the United States,men and women talk such different languages that it is like people from two different cultures trying to communicate.Professor Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University has noticed the difference in the style of boys' and girls' conversations from an early age.She says that little girls' conversation is less definite than boys' and expresses more doubts.Little boys use conversations to establish status with their listeners. These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship. Some scientists who are studying speech think that the brain is pre-programmed for language.As we are usually taught to speak by women,it seems that the brain must have a sexual bias in its programming,otherwise male speech patterns would not arise at all.

Which country's national flag comprises two overlapping triangles?","completion":"The national flag that comprises two overlapping triangles belongs to Nepal. Officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, this landlocked country is located in South Asia and lies in the lap of the Himalayan mountain range. The unique and distinctive shape of the Nepalese flag makes it easily recognizable among other national flags, as it doesn't adhere to the conventional rectangular or square designs. Nepal's flag consists of two triangular pennons, also known as pennants, which are placed vertically one above the other. These two triangles symbolize the lofty Himalayan peaks that dominate the country's landscape, while also representing the duality and balance of nature in the Hindu religion. The two most important gods in the Hindu pantheon are represented by the triangles, with the upper triangle symbolizing Shiva (the destroyer god) and the lower triangle representing Vishnu (the preserver god). These symbols reflect the Nepalese cultural landscape, which is deeply rooted in Hinduism, as a significant majority of the population follow this religion. The combination of red, blue, and white colors in the flag represents different aspects of Nepal and its people. The crimson red symbolizes bravery, and it is also the national color of Nepal – as seen adorning many historical religious and cultural artifacts. The blue border stands for peace, harmony, and tranquility, while the white celestial bodies (the sun and the crescent moon) signify continuity, purity, and the everlasting nature of the nation. The sun and the moon are designed with symbolic meanings, too. The sun with twelve rays represents the twelve months of the Nepalese solar calendar, Bikram Sambat, which drives the day-to-day activities of the locals. The crescent moon with eight wavy lines signifies the resilience and cool-headedness of the Nepalese people. Traditionally, the sun and the moon also symbolize that Nepal will last as long as these celestial bodies do, emphasizing the country's longevity and sovereignty. In conclusion, the national flag of Nepal is a potent symbol reflecting the natural, cultural, and historical aspects of the country. Its unusual design, comprising two overlapping triangles, sets it apart from other national flags and communicates a deep-seated connection to the Himalayas, Hinduism, and the enduring spirit of the Nepalese people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

Adam Hambly, 32, was left fighting for his life after suffering multiple injuries in the head-on smash in November. Wife Jo, 35, rushed to be by his side and waited anxiously for signs of recovery. But she was admitted as a patient herself to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, when she started suffering contractions two months before she was due. 'I was in the delivery room on one bed and","completion":"Adam was in the other bed, recovering from his injuries. The medical professionals were busy tending to both of us simultaneously, desperately trying to maintain calm in a tense and emotional situation. The sterile hospital room was filled with the beeping sounds of monitoring equipment and the fervent whispers of the nurses as they went about their work. I clutched Adam's hand tightly, and our eyes locked, communicating a world of emotions that neither had the strength to speak aloud. As the contractions grew stronger and more frequent, I tried to focus my thoughts on the impending birth of our child as well as the health of my beloved husband. Dr. Richardson, the Chief Obstetrician, prepared for the delivery, guiding the nurses and maintaining a reassuring presence amid the chaos. Adam, who was heavily sedated due to his critical condition, managed to muster a strained smile that conveyed his own mixture of fear and hope. Meanwhile, Dr. Nelson, the neurosurgeon in charge of Adam's case, continued to monitor his condition, running tests and discussing with colleagues the most appropriate course of action. The severity of his injuries was evident in the somber expressions of the medical team who fought to bring him back from the brink. The ensuing hours felt like an eternity, with both the delivery and the surgical intervention for Adam progressing at what seemed like an agonizingly slow pace. Friends and family members paced the corridor outside the room, anxious for any news but knowing that the situation was far beyond their control. Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, a baby's cry pierced the silence, the announcement of a new life entering the world against all odds. Tears filled my eyes as I was handed our tiny, fragile miracle, prematurely born as a symbol of hope and perseverance in the face of overwhelming adversity. Dr. Richardson and his team congratulated us with warm smiles, but the celebration was shadowed by concern for Adam's ongoing health struggle. It was then that Dr. Nelson stepped forward with the news we had all been eagerly awaiting. In a voice heavy with emotion, he explained that Adam's condition had finally stabilized, and he would remain in a medically-induced coma for the time being. This allowed his injuries to heal, and the medical team could continue to monitor his progress closely. Though still uncertain, it seemed that Adam's life had been saved, snatched from the jaws of death through the exceptional efforts of his medical team. Relief washed over me like a tidal wave, leaving me in a state of emotional exhaustion. As I cradled our newborn, gazing lovingly at Adam's battered but still beautiful face, I knew that the sentence had ended, but a new and challenging journey awaited our family. We would face these obstacles together and emerge stronger, united by love and the unbreakable bond we had forged through this harrowing experience."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who told another band member never to talk into the microphone again? from the following article ? With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.

In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore.

As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the man that pretends to be homosexual to avoid being drafted? from the following article ? The story focuses on the Turtles in the days leading up to and following the success of their single \\"Happy Together\\". Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman receive their draft cards and Frank Zappa tells them to seek advice from Herb Cohen, Zappa's manager and Kaylan's cousin, to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War. Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which the Turtles declare to be the greatest album they ever heard. At a nearby pub, the Turtles have a disastrous meeting with the Beatles, in which Turtles guitarist Jim Tucker is verbally abused by John Lennon, leading the Turtles to leave the bar as Kaylan stays behind and Brian Jones, the founder of the Rolling Stones, introduces Kaylan to Jimi Hendrix, who Kaylan ends up having dinner and a conversation with, while the two drink much alcohol and smoke marijuana, with the evening ultimately ending with Kaylan vomiting on Hendrix' suit. Kaylan ultimately purchases copies of Sgt. Pepper and the Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut, Are You Experienced? and Tucker quits the Turtles and the music industry, never getting over his treatment by John Lennon, although the postscript states that Tucker remains a fan of the Beatles' music.

Answer a question about this article: ARC was acquired in 1938 by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS, which, in turn, had been formed by the Columbia Phonograph Company, but then sold off). ARC was renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. The Columbia Phonograph Company had international subsidiaries and affiliates such as the Columbia Graphophone Company in the United Kingdom, but they were sold off prior to CBS acquiring American Columbia. RCA Victor Records executive Ted Wallerstein convinced CBS head William S. Paley to buy ARC and Paley made Wallerstein head of the newly acquired record company. The renamed company made Columbia its flagship label with Okeh its subsidiary label while deemphasizing ARC's other labels. This allowed ARC's leased labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records to revert to former owner Warner Bros. which sold the labels to Decca Records. Columbia kept the Brunswick catalogue recorded from December 1931 onward which was reissued on the Columbia label as well as the Vocalion label material from the same time period which was reissued on the Okeh label. Wallerstein, who was promoted at the end of 1947 from president to chairman of the record company, restored Columbia's status as a leading record company and spearheaded the successful introduction of the long playing (LP) record before he retired as Columbia's chairman in 1951. James Conkling then became head of Columbia Records. Also in 1951, Columbia severed its ties with the EMI-owned record label of the same name and began a UK distribution deal with Philips Records, whereas Okeh Records continued to be distributed by EMI on the Columbia label. What did CBS call ARC after buying it?","completion":"After CBS acquired ARC in 1938, they renamed it the Columbia Recording Corporation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usually, when we use the word \\"escapist\\", we mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's big screen version of \\"Dick Tracy\\" proves that \\"escapist\\" can be good. This is truly one entertaining movie. As the eponymous, yellow-clad, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. From there, the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be; Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include the speech-challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin), and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star. Oh, wait a minute. I haven't even explained the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and failing so far - to find some way to nab Big Boy. Simultaneously, some very bizarre events have been going on in town, the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks.

Question: who created facebook I found the following answer on Google: Facebook Inc. began selling stock to the public and trading on the NASDAQ on May 18, 2012. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google refers to the date when Facebook Inc. began trading on the stock market and not to the person who created it. Facebook was created by Mark Zuckerberg, along with his college roommates Andrew McCollum, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Dustin Moskovitz. It was initially launched as \\"Thefacebook\\" on February 4, 2004, at Harvard University. The website was designed as a platform for college students to communicate and connect with each other, and it rapidly expanded to other universities, eventually becoming available to the general public. Mark Zuckerberg is the key figure behind the creation of Facebook. He was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, and grew up in Dobbs Ferry, New York. He entered Harvard University in 2002 as a computer science and psychology major. He had already gained recognition as a talented programmer and software developer, having created several applications and games during high school. During his time at Harvard, Zuckerberg developed a website called Facemash, which allowed users to compare and rate the attractiveness of their fellow students. The popularity of Facemash led Zuckerberg to come up with the idea of creating a social networking site exclusive to Harvard students. This idea later evolved into what we now know as Facebook. The initial success of \\"Thefacebook\\" spurred rapid expansion to other universities, such as Yale, Stanford, and Columbia. Eventually, the site's membership was extended to other schools, and later in September 2006, the eligibility was opened to anyone with a valid email address who was at least 13 years old. The development and expansion of Facebook involved some legal disputes and challenges related to intellectual property and data privacy, but the platform continued to grow exponentially. In 2012, the company made its initial public offering (IPO) under the name Facebook Inc., and its stock began trading on the NASDAQ. Since then, Facebook has become one of the largest social media platforms globally, with billions of active users, and has acquired other popular platforms such as Instagram and WhatsApp. So, to answer your question, Mark Zuckerberg is considered the primary creator of Facebook. The information you found about Facebook Inc. trading on the stock market since May 18, 2012 is also correct, but it doesn't directly answer the question of who created Facebook."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming back home they are 3-0 against the AFC West.

The Falcons however took the lead with Matt Ryan finding Roddy White on a 4-yard pass to move up 7-3. However, the Raiders would come within a point with Janikowski kicking a 22-yard field goal and then retook the lead with Carson Palmer's 25-yard touchdown pass to Denarius Moore for a 13-7 halftime lead.

Options: a ) 12.5 % , b ) 40 % , c ) 50 % , d ) 60 % , e ) 67.5 %","completion":"Let's analyze the problem step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the problem statement We are given that 60% of the counties received rain on Monday and 65% of the counties received rain on Tuesday. We also know that 25% of the counties received no rain either day. We need to find the percentage of counties that received rain on both Monday and Tuesday. Step 2: Determine the percentage of counties that received rain on either day Since 25% of the counties received no rain, 75% of the counties must have received rain on at least one of the days. Step 3: Apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion To find the percentage of counties that received rain on both days, we will use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This states that the percentage of elements in the union of two sets is the sum of the percentages in each set minus the percentage of elements in the intersection of the two sets: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) In our case: P(Monday ∪ Tuesday) = P(Monday) + P(Tuesday) - P(Monday ∩ Tuesday) We know P(Monday ∪ Tuesday) = 75% (from step 2), P(Monday) = 60%, and P(Tuesday) = 65%. Step 4: Calculate the percentage of counties that received rain on both days Now we will plug the values into the equation: 75% = 60% + 65% - P(Monday ∩ Tuesday) Solving for P(Monday ∩ Tuesday): P(Monday ∩ Tuesday) = 60% + 65% - 75% P(Monday ∩ Tuesday) = 125% - 75% P(Monday ∩ Tuesday) = 50% So, the answer is: c) 50%"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tropic Thunder is a 2008 black satirical action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller, who stars with Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors who are making a fictional Vietnam War film. When their frustrated director drops them in the middle of a jungle, they are forced to rely on their acting skills to survive the real action and danger. The screenplay by Justin Theroux, Stiller, and Etan Cohen was from a story by Stiller and Theroux. The film was produced by Stuart Cornfeld, Stiller and Eric McLeod for Red Hour Productions and DreamWorks Pictures as an international co-production between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Although Southern California and Mexico were considered for the main unit filming, the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i (where Stiller has a home) was selected for the majority of the shooting. Kaua'i was chosen over Mexico because a tax credit for in-state spending was negotiated with the Kaua'i Film Commission. John Toll, the cinematographer, stated the island was also selected for its similarity to Vietnam, based on its dense foliage, variety of terrains, and weather. Kaua'i was first scouted as a possible location to film Tropic Thunder in 2004. Stiller spent more than 25 hours over 6 weeks exploring the island, using all-terrain vehicles, boats, and helicopters. After the film was greenlit by DreamWorks in 2006, pre-production lasted for six months, most of this time spent on scouting additional locations for filming. Filming for the Los Angeles and interior scenes occurred on sets at Universal Studios in Hollywood. Tropic Thunder was the first major studio production on Kaua'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than 60 million to the local economy. Tim Ryan, the executive editor of Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: \\"I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ... It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar.\\" Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteen weeks over seven separate locations on the island. Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas. Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film. Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters. Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months. The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues. The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain. The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted to ensure the war scenes, including the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload their weapons, as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What can increase the occurance of earthquakes? Choices: - three plates sliding - plates breaking - plates rupturing - two plates sliding A: Answer:","completion":"A detailed and long answer to the given question is as follows. The occurrence of earthquakes is determined by the movement of tectonic plates located in the Earth's lithosphere. These large slabs of solid rock float on the more fluid asthenosphere beneath them and move due to the forces of convection of the Earth's mantle, which cause them to either slide past each other, collide, or diverge. The interaction and motion of these plates result in a continual release of stress in the form of seismic activity, including earthquakes. Out of the given choices, the most appropriate answer is \\"two plates sliding,\\" as this accounts for a significant level of earthquake activity. When two tectonic plates slide past each other, this is known as a transform boundary. The friction between the edges of these plates may cause them to lock together, building up strain as they try to slide past each other. Eventually, the strain becomes too much, and the plates snap and slide rapidly in opposite directions, releasing the built-up energy as an earthquake. While the other choices also relate to tectonic plate activity, they are not as directly linked to earthquakes as two plates sliding. 1. Three plates sliding: While it is possible for three tectonic plates to interact at the same point, known as a triple junction, this is not a primary cause of increased earthquake occurrence. The individual interactions between the plates would still involve two plates sliding, colliding, or diverging. These individual interactions would still be the primary factors influencing the occurrence of earthquakes. 2. Plates breaking: This refers to the process of rifting, which occurs at divergent boundaries when two plates move away from each other. While it is true that this process is associated with seismic activity, it is more commonly linked to volcanic activity due to the formation of new crust through the upwelling of molten rock from the mantle. Rifting does not increase the occurrence of earthquakes in the same way that two plates sliding past each other would. 3. Plates rupturing: Although the term \\"rupturing\\" could apply to an earthquake event, it does not describe the tectonic processes involved. The interaction of tectonic plates is more accurately described as sliding, colliding, or diverging. The rupturing of plates typically refers to the sudden release of stress during an earthquake rather than a specific process that may lead to increased earthquake occurrence. In summary, earthquake occurrences can be increased primarily by two plates sliding past each other. While the other options do relate to tectonic plate activity, they are not as directly connected to the occurrence of earthquakes. The interaction of tectonic plates at transform boundaries, where two plates slide past one another, allows for the buildup and sudden release of stress that is responsible for the most significant earthquake events observed on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Augustine was one of the first Christian ancient Latin authors with a very clear vision of theological anthropology. He saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body. In his late treatise On Care to Be Had for the Dead, section 5 (420 AD) he exhorted to respect the body on the grounds that it belonged to the very nature of the human person. Augustine's favourite figure to describe body-soul unity is marriage: caro tua, coniunx tua - your body is your wife. Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the fall of humanity they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another. They are two categorically different things. The body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions. Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body. Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with going too much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason. Like other Church Fathers such as Athenagoras, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Basil of Caesarea, Augustine \\"vigorously condemned the practice of induced abortion\\", and although he disapproved of an abortion during any stage of pregnancy, he made a distinction between early abortions and later ones. He acknowledged the distinction between \\"formed\\" and \\"unformed\\" fetuses mentioned in the Septuagint translation of Exodus 21:22-23, which is considered as wrong translation of the word \\"harm\\" from the original Hebrew text as \\"form\\" in the Greek Septuagint and based in Aristotelian distinction \\"between the fetus before and after its supposed 'vivification'\\", and did not classify as murder the abortion of an \\"unformed\\" fetus since he thought that it could not be said with certainty that the fetus had already received a soul. Augustine held that \\"the timing of the infusion of the soul was a mystery known to God alone\\". However, he considered procreation as one of the goods of marriage; abortion figured as a means, along with drugs which cause sterility, of frustrating this good. It lay along a continuum which included infanticide as an instance of 'lustful cruelty' or 'cruel lust.' Augustine called the use of means to avoid the birth of a child an 'evil work:' a reference to either abortion or contraception or both.\\" Answer this question \\"what was his greatest accomplishment?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"The text provided does not specifically mention Augustine's greatest accomplishment.

Since self-help books intend to provide guidance and motivation, it is important to think about the possible feelings generated by such books. Step 2: Evaluate each answer choice a) Inspiration - Self-help books usually impart helpful tips, often through personal stories and motivational messages, to inspire and change the reader's perspective or attitude towards their own life. b) Dreams - While self-help books may encourage dreaming big and setting goals, it's unlikely that dreams directly emerge from studying the books. c) More intelligence - Although the books might provide knowledge, they are primarily focused on personal development and self-improvement. Thus, increased intelligence might be a byproduct, but not the primary feeling induced. d) Understanding - Gaining understanding is certainly a part of studying self-help books, but in this case, understanding refers to a cognitive outcome rather than an emotion. e) Knowing more - Similar to understanding, knowing more is a possible outcome of reading the books, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the emotional impact associated with reading such material. Step 3: Select the most appropriate answer Based on the assessment of each option, \\"inspiration\\" stands out as the most appropriate answer.

The reviewer had purchased this book for a 10-year-old and expressed dissatisfaction due to the book's lack of content that caters to the child's age. The reviewer's primary concern seems to be that the book consists mainly of great pictures and does not provide age-appropriate content or challenges for their 10-year-old child. In the description of the book, it is mentioned that a target age group is up to 6 years old, which indicates that it is meant primarily for younger children. However, the reviewer bought it for a child far beyond the recommended age range. This age discrepancy may have led to the negative feedback received from the reviewer. The book may very well cater to younger readers and provide them with an engaging, visually pleasing experience. However, it is not suitable for a 10-year-old reader that requires more comprehensive and stimulating content. In conclusion, the review is negative because the book did not meet the expectations of the reviewer who purchased it for a 10-year-old child. It is essential to consider the target age range mentioned for a book before buying it to ensure that it caters to the specific reading needs and preferences of the intended recipient.

Summarize this article: At least four people were injured Sunday afternoon after a man crashed into a San Jose Walmart, exited the vehicle, picked up a blunt object from inside the store and began to assault customers, police said. The man drove a red two-door car between 10 and 20 feet into the store on the east side of the city about 11:15 a.m., said Officer Albert Morales, of the San Jose Police Department. Authorities have not released the identity of the man. One of the customers suffered a serious injury and was taken to a local hospital. Three others were treated for non-life-threatening injuries, Morales said. The man, who is about 30 years old, was arrested after a brief struggle with police. At least 70 people witnessed the crash, Morales said. Police are investigating what motivated the man to drive into the busy store. “We don’t know if there was an intended target or not,” Morales said. The driver made several laps around the store’s parking lot before crashing into the front entrance, witnesses told the San Jose Mercury News. A woman said the driver sideswiped her Honda in the parking lot while she was waiting for a spot. \\"At first I thought I may have done something to anger him while driving, \\" said Sharon Kaye, a teacher from San Jose. \\"But then I realized he was out to get into the store.\\" ALSO: Cesar Chavez honored with Google doodle Seven injured after sheriff's patrol car crashes into van Major flaws found in GPS ankle monitors used for high-risk sex offenders Twitter: @nicolesantacruz nicole.santacruz@latimes.com ||||| SAN JOSE -- A Walmart store erupted into chaos and at least four people were hurt Sunday when a man rammed an Oldsmobile Cutlass through the entrance, then attacked an employee and shoppers with a blunt object, police said. At 11:15 a.m., the unidentified driver in the red, two-door Cutlass Salon struck two other automobiles in the Walmart Supercenter parking lot, at 777 Story Road, in East San Jose and then crashed through the pharmacy and market entrance and continued a few dozen feet until colliding into a beer display. After leaving his car, he picked up an object inside the store and assaulted people, seriously injuring at least one, said San Jose Police Officer Albert Morales. WalMart employees huddle in the parking lot outside the store on Story Road in San Jose, Calif., after a vehicle drove into the building and a driver reportedly began assaulting people in the store Sunday afternoon March 31, 2013. (Karl Mondon/Staff) (Karl Mondon) One of the injured victims was a Walmart employee. The assailant, described as a man in his 30s, was tackled and tied up by bystanders, according to one shopper who did not want her name used. Police said the driver was arrested and is being treated at a local hospital. As of Sunday afternoon, police had not identified him, Morales said, and would only say his injuries are not life-threatening. The person suffering serious injuries and three others who sustained lesser, non-life-threatening injuries, were transported to a local hospital, Morales said. Shocking car moves Advertisement Sharon Kaye of San Jose was still feeling shaken on Sunday afternoon after her car was sideswiped by the Cutlass. She said the driver first hit a car near the parking lot entrance, then struck her 2009 Honda CRV as she was waiting in it near the front of the store to turn into a parking aisle. The Cutlass then sped up and down other parking aisles, again approaching her car head-on. \\"Oh, my goodness, he's going to hurt someone,\\" Kaye said she thought to herself as she turned from confused to frightened. The speeding car drove over collision debris, passing her car on the right. It did another turn around the parking lot, then came from behind Kaye's car, drove between cement pylons on the walkway and tried unsuccessfully to veer into the glass doors at the store entrance, she said. When the turn proved to be too acute, Kaye said, the driver backed up and came at the doors from a wider angle and plowed through them and the door frames. \\"I stood there shocked,\\" she said. \\"It was very scary.\\" She told the first arriving police officer that he needed to call for backup. According to police, once inside the store, the driver exited the car and began assaulting people. One shopper said the weapon appeared to be a metal bar. Inside, Morales said, \\"people were running out of the store, people were crying, people were just confused about what was going on.\\" Injured associate Shopper Tianna Doan of San Jose said that a Walmart cashier was struck and suffered a head injury. She also said that shoppers were trying to take the driver out of the car and hold him down. Paramedics treated the injured and placed them in ambulances. Police cordoned off the parking lot. The store was evacuated and closed for several hours, Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said. \\"We're obviously very concerned about the associate who was injured.\\" Authorities hauled the car away around 2 p.m. and crews were working to repair the automatic doors where the car crashed through. At mid-afternoon, they were still interviewing some of the 70 people they had identified as witnesses, Morales said. Police did not identify the victims, nor their conditions. Kaye, an opera singer and voice teacher, said although her car lost its bumper, sustained other damage and had to be towed, she is grateful that she was not seriously injured. She had just attended Easter services and left church early to pick up ingredients to make scalloped potatoes for Easter dinner. \\"I did not get the potatoes,\\" she said. Her son picked her up from the parking lot. Although she plans to get checked out by her doctor Monday, she said, overall, \\"I am very blessed.\\" Contact Sharon Noguchi at snoguchi@mercurynews.com or 650-814-4186.

Additionally, the increased independence of these bodies will help to ensure that they are free from any undue influences or pressures, further guaranteeing fair outcomes in all cases. Several initiatives can be taken to achieve these objectives. For instance, the legal framework can be adjusted to provide courts with more discretion in decision-making, which would allow them to manage cases and rule on disputes more effectively. Similarly, legislation can ensure that public prosecutors have the necessary resources and autonomy to conduct their investigations thoroughly and independently. In addition to the abovementioned structural changes, extensive training should be provided to judges and prosecutors to enable them to deal with the increased responsibility that comes with greater power and authority. This training should address the importance of maintaining impartiality and upholding the rule of law throughout the legal process, further contributing to a more effective and efficient judiciary system overall. The benefits of empowering courts and public prosecutors with more independence can be far-reaching. An independent judiciary is crucial to a well-functioning democratic system, and a strong legal framework is a prerequisite for social and economic progress. Furthermore, by fostering a culture of transparency and accountability, these changes can ultimately contribute to a more harmonious and just society. In conclusion, implementing changes in the legal infrastructure to provide more power and independence to courts and public prosecutors is essential for promoting a fair and unbiased judicial system. This, in turn, supports the foundation of a democratic society that values the rule of law and the rights of its citizens. By ensuring that these institutions have the necessary authority, autonomy, and resources, we can build a better, more equitable legal system that protects the interests of all members of society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Anastasia Movie plot: In 1916, Tsar Nicholas II hosts a ball at the Catherine Palace to celebrate the Romanov tricentennial. His mother, the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, is visiting from Paris and gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words âTogether in Parisâ as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, eight-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia. The ball is suddenly interrupted by the sorcerer Grigori Rasputin, the former royal advisor of the Romanovs until he was banished by Nicholas II for treason. Feeling betrayed and seeking revenge, Rasputin sold his soul in exchange for an unholy reliquary, which he uses to place a curse on the Romanov family, sparking the Russian Revolution. Only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape the ensuing siege of the palace, thanks to a young servant boy named Dimitri who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasia's room. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and giving her amnesia. Ten years later in 1926, Russia is under communist rule and Marie has publicly offered 10 million rubles for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime Vladimir search for a look-alike to bring to Paris and pass off as Anastasia so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, Anastasia, now using the name \\"Anya\\", leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, still suffering from amnesia. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names \\"Pooka\\", she decides to head to Saint Petersburg, inspired by the passage on the necklace she still has.

In his quest for retribution, Rasputin sells his soul in exchange for an unholy reliquary, which he uses to place a curse on the entire Romanov family.

Background: Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. Context: From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year. After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe. Question: did he produce any other music? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Duke Ellington produced a significant amount of music throughout his career, both as a bandleader and composer. Apart from the well-known pieces and collaborations mentioned in the context, Ellington continued to create music spanning various genres, including jazz, orchestral, and sacred music. Some of his notable works include \\"Mood Indigo\\", \\"Sophisticated Lady\\", \\"Prelude to a Kiss\\", and \\"Satin Doll\\". Moreover, his partnership with Billy Strayhorn yielded further iconic compositions such as \\"Take the 'A' Train\\" and \\"Chelsea Bridge\\". Ellington's prolific output and innovative approach influenced and enriched the development of jazz and American music in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article using the following points: Royal won three national championships as head coach at University of Texas. He helped introduce the wishbone formation to college football. Royal is the winningest coach at Texas, one of college football's biggest programs.","completion":"Title: Darrell Royal: The Winningest Coach and the Legacy He Left at the University of Texas Introduction: In the arena of college football, a number of legends have left their imprint on the game. However, few can hold a candle to the remarkable achievements of Darrell Royal, the iconic head coach at the University of Texas. In a career spanning two decades, Royal etched his name into football history, not just for his string of victories but also for the revolutionary tactical approach he introduced. Let us take a closer look at Royal's journey as he cemented himself as the winningest coach at Texas, one of college football's biggest programs. Step 1: Highlighting Royal's accomplishments Darrell Royal's success as the head coach at the University of Texas is nothing short of legendary. During his tenure, he led the Longhorns to three national championships, helping the team secure national glory in 1963, 1969, and 1970. Under his expert guidance, UT was transformed into a formidable force on the field, garnering widespread admiration and respect from competition and fans alike. Step 2: Exploring the wishbone formation While Royal's coaching acumen was undoubtedly a key factor contributing to the Longhorns' success, it was his innovative introduction of the wishbone formation that truly set him apart. Royal, along with offensive coordinator Emory Bellard, devised this groundbreaking tactic in the late 1960s, forever changing the landscape of college football. The wishbone formation, characterized by a unique alignment of the running backs and the quarterback, served as the cornerstone for Royal's offensive strategy. It gave the offense more options for running and passing plays, catching opposing defenses off guard and revolutionizing how football teams approached the game. Step 3: Establishing Royal as the winningest coach at Texas As one of the biggest programs in college football, the Texas Longhorns have seen numerous coaches come and go. Yet, amidst this ever-changing lineup, Darrell Royal reigns supreme as the winningest coach in the program's history. In 20 seasons as the head coach, Royal racked up an impressive record of 167-47-5, setting a benchmark for success that remains unmatched to this day. Step 4: Royal's lasting impact on the university Darrell Royal's outstanding achievements have made him an enduring figure in the annals of football history. The University of Texas recognized Royal's immense contribution to the institution and the sport by naming their football stadium \\"Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium\\" in 1996. Today, the stadium stands as a testament to his enduring legacy and a symbol of the impact he had on the game. Conclusion: Darrell Royal's influence on the world of college football is unparalleled, and his tenure at the University of Texas established him as one of the greatest coaches in the history of the sport. Through his strategic innovations and relentless pursuit of victory, Royal raised the bar for future coaches and left an indelible mark on the Longhorn football program. As generations of players and fans reflect on his remarkable career, the legend of Darrell Royal remains a cornerstone of college football history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The next time you eat a piece of chocolate, be sure to enjoy it, because according to two of the world's largest chocolate makers--Mars Inc and Barry Callebaut, the treat may soon be in short supply. The problem? We are consuming the candy at a faster pace than farmers can grow cocoa. The manufacturers say that in 2013, people consumed 70,000 tons more cocoa than was produced. Experts say that this is the worst supply-demand imbalance they have experienced in more than 50 years. Parts of the reason for the condition is the large reduction in supply, caused by a continuous drought in the west African countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced. Additionally, a certain disease known as frosty pod has destroyed 30 to 40 percent of global cocoa production. As a result, many farmers have turned to more profitable and easier grown crops like corn. This means that even if conditions improve, cocoa production may never get back to normal. Meanwhile, the world is only getting hungrier for chocolate. The biggest increase in demand is from the residents of emerging market countries like India. Though their consumption is nowhere close to the amount European devour, their newly acquired amount for the treat , is making a huge dent in an already tight market. There is also the growing desire for dark chocolate, which contains more than 70 percent cocoa compared to normal chocolates. Experts believe that if consumption continue at this pace, cocoa deficits could swell to one million tons by 2020 and to an even more worrisome, two million tons, by 2030. Not surprisingly, cocoa prices have risen by 60% since 2012, a cost that manufacturers have offset by raising the prices of everyone's favorite candy. As the situation worsens, the price of chocolate can only rise--so be sure to enjoy piece of the sweet treat, like it is your last! Question: It is hard to raise cocoa production probably because_.

This drought, combined with the frosty pod disease, which has destroyed 30-40% of global cocoa production, has led many farmers to switch to more profitable and easier-to-grow crops like corn.

How to remove a lien Analyze situations that may result in a lien being filed. A lien is a security interest placed on property. A security interest means that the property serves as security for a debt you owe to another party. [+] The property may be real property (home) or personal property (car, jewelry). When you purchase a home, you enter into a home mortgage.; [+] That property does not typically have to be secured by a deed. Certain types of transactions could lead to a lien : Transaction by a bank or other financial institution.; [+] How long it may last depends on your debt to the other party. For example, a lien may persist until the other party pays off the debt and runs away with the debt.; [+] In most cases, a lien is simply intended to last until the loan end of the year. You should understand the facts that will render the lien enforceable : Debts must be paid in full at the end of a loan.;","completion":"Answer: [+] To remove a lien, you need to pay off the debt you owe to the other party. When you pay off the debt, the lien will no longer be enforceable, and your property will be free from the lien. Explanation: A lien is like a promise that you give to someone when you borrow their stuff. If you don't give back their stuff after you borrowed it, they can take something from you that is valuable, like your house or your car. This is done to make sure that you will give back their stuff. Now, if you want to take away this promise and make sure they don't take your valuable things, you need to give their stuff back first, which means paying off the debt you owe to them. If you do that, your valuable things will be safe, and the person will not have the right to take them anymore."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the orbiting satellite? from the following article ? The story is set in an alternate reality America circa 1985 under the authoritarian control of President Fremont. It makes liberal references to the collected works of Philip K. Dick. Berkeley record store clerk Nick Brady lives modestly with his wife Rachel and their infant son. Nick has been experiencing strange visions and dreams. He confides in Rachel and his best friend, science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS. One recurring symbol that he has been seeing is an ichthys. While he and Phil sit at a table, an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick's head. He rushes his son to the ER, convinced that he has an inguinal hernia. The skeptical doctor is stunned to find that Nick is right. Nick has subsequent visions that tell him that he should relocate to Los Angeles, where he lands a job at a record label. Philip gets visited by two members of FAP (Friends of the American People). They press him for information about Nick's visions. The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip.

Lewis Henry Morgan (November 21, 1818 - December 17, 1881) was a pioneering American anthropologist and social theorist who worked as a railroad lawyer. He is best known for his work on kinship and social structure, his theories of social evolution, and his ethnography of the Iroquois. Interested in what holds societies together, he proposed the concept that the earliest human domestic institution was the matrilineal clan, not the patriarchal family. Also interested in what leads to social change, he was a contemporary of the European social theorists Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who were influenced by reading his work on social structure and material culture, the influence of technology on progress. After graduating in 1840, Morgan returned to Aurora to read the law with an established firm. In 1842 he was admitted to the bar in Rochester, where he went into partnership with a Union classmate, George F. Danforth, a future judge. They could find no clients, as the nation was in an economic depression, which had started with the Panic of 1837. Morgan wrote essays, which he had begun to do while studying law, and published some in The Knickerbocker under the pen name Aquarius. On January 1, 1841, Morgan and some friends from Cayuga Academy formed a secret fraternal society which they called the Gordian Knot. As Morgan's earliest essays from that time had classical themes, the club may have been a kind of literary society, as was common then. In 1841 or 1842 the young men redefined the society, renaming it the Order of the Iroquois. Morgan referred to this event as cutting the knot. In 1843 they named it the Grand Order of the Iroquois, followed by the New Confederacy of the Iroquois. They made the group a research organization to collect information on the Iroquois, whose historical territory for centuries had included central and upstate New York west of the Hudson and the Finger Lakes region. The men intended to resurrect the spirit of the Iroquois. They tried to learn the languages, assumed Iroquois names, and organized the group by the historic pattern of Iroquois tribes. In 1844 they received permission from the former Freemasons of Aurora to use the upper floor of the Masonic temple as a meeting hall. New members underwent a secret rite called inindianation in which they were transformed spiritually into Iroquois. They met in the summer around campfires and paraded yearly through the town in costume. Morgan seemed infused with the spirit of the Iroquois. He said, \\"We are now upon the very soil over which they exercised dominion ... Poetry still lingers around the scenery....\\" These new Iroquois retained a literary frame of mind, but they intended to focus on \\"the writing of a native American epic that would define national identity\\". Were they able to reach their goal?","completion":"Lewis Henry Morgan and his peers in the Order of the Iroquois aimed to create a native American epic that would define national identity. While their intentions were passionate and they immersed themselves in Iroquois culture, they did not ultimately achieve the goal of creating an American epic. However, Morgan's work did have an enduring impact in other ways. His studies on the Iroquois, along with his ethnographic work on other Native American tribes, greatly influenced the field of anthropology, particularly his work on kinship systems and social structures. His theories of social evolution and the influences of technology on progress also left a lasting impression on academic and social thought. Additionally, his writings on these subjects had a notable effect on European social theorists such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In summary, while Lewis Henry Morgan and the Order of the Iroquois did not achieve their initial goal of creating a literary epic that defined American national identity, their studies and efforts contributed significantly to the development and understanding of anthropology, social structures, and the influence of technology on progress."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question What age group can you likely assume the speaker is a member of ? Possible answers: pick from the following. -They are a young adult .. -They are middle aged .. -They are a senior .. -None of the above choices .. The answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can likely assume the speaker is a member of the middle-aged group. This assumption is derived from several key details in the description of the weekend experience. The first clue is that it was a class reunion. Class reunions typically occur at significant milestones after graduation, such as 10-year, 20-year, or 30-year reunions, among others. The fact that the speaker emphasized the large number of healthy and alive classmates suggests that enough years have passed since graduation for this to be a notable observation. It is less likely that the speaker would be a young adult, as the classmates' health would not be as remarkable in that case. Furthermore, the speaker mentioned that seeing their classmates \\"healthy, alive, and kicking was a beautiful blessing.\\" This sentiment implies that they have an increased awareness of the fragility of life and the potential health issues that can arise as people age. This perspective is more characteristic of a middle-aged person than a young adult who may not have experienced as many health-related concerns among their peers. Taking these factors into consideration, it can be inferred that the speaker is likely middle-aged.

Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Write a question about the following article: Razin's parents were from the village of Usman Sobakina, 8 kilometres outside of Voronezh. He was first noted by history in 1661, as part of a diplomatic mission from the Don Cossacks to the Kalmyks. That same year Razin went on a long-distance pilgrimage to the great Solovetsky Monastery on the White Sea for the benefit of his soul. After that, all trace of him was lost for six years, when he reappeared as the leader of a robber community established at Panshinskoye, among the marshes between the rivers Tishina and Ilovlya, from whence he levied tribute from all vessels passing up and down the Volga. A long war with Poland in 1654-1667 and Sweden in 1656-1658 put heavy demands upon the people of Russia. Taxes increased, as did conscription. Many peasants, hoping to escape these burdens, fled south and joined bands of Razin's marauding Cossacks. They were also joined by many others who were disaffected with the Russian government, including people of the lower classes, as well as representatives of non-Russian ethnic groups such as Kalmyks, that were being oppressed at the time. Razin's first considerable exploit was to destroy the great naval convoy consisting of the treasury barges and the barges of the Patriarch and the wealthy merchants of Moscow. Razin then sailed down the Volga with a fleet of 35 vessels, capturing the more important forts on his way and devastating the country. At the beginning of 1668, he defeated the voivode Yakov Bezobrazov, sent against him from Astrakhan, and in the spring embarked on a predatory expedition into Daghestan and Persia, which lasted for eighteen months.

Background: Canby was born in Piatt's Landing, Kentucky, to Israel T. and Elizabeth (Piatt) Canby. He attended Wabash College, but transferred to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1839. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry and served as the regimental adjutant. Although often referred to as Edward Canby, a biographer has suggested that he was known as \\"Richard\\" during childhood and to some friends for most of his life. Context: In August 1872, Canby was posted to command the Pacific Northwest. He soon faced problems with the Modoc tribe, who had traditionally lived in Northern California. Forced to remove to a reservation in Oregon which they had to share with their traditional enemies, the Klamath tribe, they had pleaded with the US government to return to California. When the US refused, the Modoc left the reservation and returned illegally. In 1872, the US Army went to fight against them to force them back and the Modoc War broke out. The Modoc, entrenched in Captain Jack's Stronghold south of Tule Lake, resisted army attacks and fought US forces to a stalemate. General Canby had received conflicting orders from Washington as to whether to make peace or war on the Modoc. As war was not working, the US government authorized a peace commission and assigned Canby a key position on it. There were many lines of communication between the Modoc and whites. At one point, someone told the Modoc leader Captain Jack that the governor of Oregon intended to hang nine Modoc, apparently without trial, as soon as they surrendered. The Modoc broke off scheduled talks; Canby was angered by the rumors and their action, as he believed that his federal authority trumped the governor's and made the threat irrelevant. Canby had no intention of allowing the Modoc to be punished without a trial. On April 11, 1873, after months of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution. Judge Elijah Steele of Yreka, California wrote later that when he warned Canby that the Modoc were volatile and he was at risk, Canby replied, \\"I believe you are right, Mr. Steele, and I shall regard your advice, but it would not be very well for the general in command to be afraid to go where the peace commissioners would venture.\\" The peace talks were held midway between the army encampment and Captain Jack's stronghold near Tule Lake. It was discovered later that two members of Canby's party brought concealed weapons and Modoc warriors were also armed. According to Jeff C. Riddle, the Modoc son of the US interpreter and the author of Indian History of the Modoc War (1914), the Modoc had plotted before the meeting to kill Canby and the other commissioners, as they believed peace was not possible. They were determined to \\"fight until we die.\\" (He was the son of Winema and Frank Riddle.) Captain Jack had been reluctant to agree to the killings, believing it \\"coward's work\\", but was pressured by other warriors to agree. He insisted on being given another chance to ask Canby to \\"give us a home in our country.\\" When Canby said he did not have the authority to make such a promise, Captain Jack attacked the general. With Ellen's Man, one of his lieutenants, he shot Canby twice in the head and cut his throat. The Modoc also killed Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a peace commissioner, and wounded others in the party. Canby was the only general to be killed during the Indian Wars. Question: How did Edward die?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Edward Canby, also known as Richard, died on April 11, 1873, during a peace negotiation with the Modoc tribe near Tule Lake.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.

Movie title: Three Days of the Condor Movie plot: Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is an employee of the CIA. He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone. Fighting down his shock and horror, he grabs a pistol from the receptionist's desk and flees.Suddenly, everyone on the street looks suspicious, and Joe realizes that whoever killed his coworkers is probably still looking for him. He finds a payphone and calls an emergency contact number at the CIA. \\"This is...uh...'Condor'\\" Joe says, fighting through the shock to remember his code name. \\"The section's been hit.

Based on the sentence \\"A person wearing a yellow t-shirt, inside a building has on a motorcycle helmet.\\", is the sentence \\"The person is not currently on a motorcycle.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the sentence \\"A person wearing a yellow t-shirt, inside a building has on a motorcycle helmet.\\", it can be inferred that the person is not currently on a motorcycle. There are a few pieces of evidence we can examine to form this conclusion. 1. The person is inside a building: Typically, motorcycles are ridden outside on roads or open spaces. Since the person is indoors, it is less likely for them to be currently on a motorcycle. It is not impossible for a motorcycle to be inside a building, but it is less common. 2. Wearing a helmet without being on a motorcycle: The person in question has a motorcycle helmet on, but that does not necessarily mean they are on a motorcycle. They could be preparing to go outside and ride a motorcycle or have just finished riding one and are now indoors. They could also be trying on the helmet for fitting purposes or to show it off to friends or coworkers. While these points of evidence suggest that the person is not currently on a motorcycle, it is important to note that without additional context, we cannot definitively determine their current status. It is entirely possible that the person could be on a motorcycle inside a building, such as in a motorcycle showroom or at an exhibition. However, considering these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that, based on the provided sentence, the statement \\"The person is not currently on a motorcycle\\" can be considered true. The available information suggests that the individual is indoors, wearing a helmet, but not actively engaged in riding a motorcycle at the moment. Additional context would be necessary for a more definitive answer, but the most likely interpretation is that the person is not on a motorcycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Article: Today we have the second report explaining how to prepare fish by drying or smoking them. We talked last week about the first steps of cleaning and salting freshly caught fish. To dry fish, you will need either a drying table or a place to hang them. If a table is used, it should have a top made of wire screen or thin pieces of wood with space between each piece. Lay the cleaned, wet salted fish on top of the table. Do not let them touch each other. Be sure that air can reach the fish from all sides. _ Turn the fish over every other day. Small fish will dry in about three days if the air is dry. Large fish will take a week or ten days to dry. After the fish have dried, place them in a basket. Cover them with clean paper or large leaves. Then put the basket in a cool, dry place off the ground. Make sure as much of the saltwater as possible is removed before you smoke the fish. The smoking can be done in a large, round metal container. Remove the top of the drum and cut a small opening on one side at the bottom. Cover the top with a strong wire screen, where you put the fish. Build a small fire in the drum by reaching in through the opening at the bottom. Wood from fruit trees makes good fuel for your fire. _ will give the smoked fish good color1 and taste. One way to get a lot of smoke is to use green wood, not dried wood. You should smoke the fish for five days or longer if you plan to keep them for a long time. After that, wrap them in clean paper, put the fish in baskets and keep them in a cool, dry place off the ground. Question: What can we infer from the passage? Answer: Answer:","completion":"We can infer from the passage that there are two main methods for preserving fish: drying and smoking. Both methods require specific steps to ensure the fish are properly preserved and safe for consumption. The article provides a detailed process for each method, emphasizing the importance of cleanliness, good airflow, and proper storage conditions. For drying fish, the article informs us that a drying table or a hanging area is needed, ensuring that air can circulate around the fish. The process may take from three days for small fish to up to ten days for larger fish. For smoking fish, it is essential to remove as much saltwater as possible before starting the process. A large metal container, like a drum, is needed along with a strong wire screen for placing the fish. Using wood from fruit trees and green wood (not dried wood) as fuel for the fire will result in better color and taste in the smoked fish. The smoking process takes around five days or longer if the goal is to store the fish for an extended period. In conclusion, the passage provides valuable information about the drying and smoking procedures for preserving fish with a focus on adequate preparation, proper techniques, and ideal storage conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Mud Island experienced fewer rocks moving several centimeters.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Oak leaves and acorns are both poisonous, and they're known to cause agitation, liver damage, and abdominal pain. Oak leaves are usually deeply lobed and a dark, rich green color. Oaks can be found in the Americas, Asia, Europe and part of North Africa. Oak leaves are poisonous to both humans and most animals, and they should never be grown near livestock. Oleander trees are extremely poisonous and often fatal. Ingesting an oleander leaf or branch can cause heart problems, digestive upset, and even death. Oleander leaves can be identified by their long and thin blades, leathery texture, and tendency to grow in pairs or groups of 3. Oleander plants are native to the Mediterranean region but is a common ornamental tree in gardens all over the world. Ohio buckeyes are highly poisonous trees that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, paralysis, and death. The leaves are arranged in pairs of 5-7, resembling fingers on a hand, and are a bright green color with jagged edges. Buckeyes are the state tree of Ohio, and the plant is native to the midwestern United States. Although chokecherry berries are safe to eat, every other part of the plant (including the berry pit) is poisonous. Chokecherry leaves are wide and flat, with curved veins, a fine-toothed edge, and a petiole less than 1/3 the length of the entire leaf. Chokecherry plants are also poisonous to horses and cattle, causing labored breathing, muscle spasms, and death in extreme cases. Manchineel trees, among the most poisonous plants in the world, ooze a toxic sap that can cause blistering, respiratory problems, or death in humans. Manchineel leaves can be recognized by their long petiole, shiny yellow-green blade, and thinly serrated edges. Manchineel trees are native mainly to the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, though they can also be found in the southern United States.","completion":"This article highlights the dangers and identifying features of various poisonous trees, including oak leaves and acorns, oleander, Ohio buckeyes, chokecherry plants, and manchineel trees, which can cause serious health problems or death in humans and animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. Question: \\"What are the consequences of LAD funding cuts and who will be affected most?\\" Answer: \\"There will be no negative consequences\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer provided is incorrect. The text clearly outlines that there will be significant negative consequences as a direct result of the funding cuts for the Legal Aid and Defender Association (LAD) in Michigan. Both federal and state funding are dwindling, which will severely impact the ability of LAD to provide necessary legal services for those living in poverty. The direct consequences are expected to include the reduction of services in key civil legal areas such as landlord-tenant issues, bankruptcy, consumer cases, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. Additionally, LAD will have to increase its use of technology to compensate for the reduced funding and anticipate that they will have to provide more self-help training to clients. This means clients will have to navigate the legal process by themselves more often. The demographics that will feel this impact most dramatically are the impoverished populations of Michigan, particularly in Wayne County. Despite a noted decline in poverty rates from the census data, which is the basis for determining federal funding, the demand for LAD services remains exceedingly high. The state's largest concentration of poverty resides in Wayne County, with roughly 333,000 people anticipated to be affected. As the funding reductions roll out, it's expected that several thousands of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive a significantly reduced level of service. These populations are essentially victimized twice - once by their impoverished status and again by the funding cuts. Moreover, the executive director of LAD, Deirdre L. Weir, pointed out the likelihood of undercounting impoverished populations within census tracts. This suggests the demand for services and the shortfalls from funding cuts may be even more profound than the direct consequences currently being anticipated."},{"prompt":"Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how do wolves hunt?\\" is \\"it needs them\\", given that wolves hunt by sensing light?

They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If the biologists predict a decrease in deer birth rates are there a high amount of resources or low amount of resources? Hint: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, if the biologists predict a decrease in deer birth rates, it would indicate that there is a low amount of resources available. As resources, such as food, decrease, the birth rates drop, and the population growth rate decreases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Who is a psychopath and who is a sociopath? What are the qualities of psychopath and sociopath? How to tell their differences? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, although they share a similar subject. The first question asks about the definitions and differences between psychopaths and sociopaths. The second question focuses specifically on their qualities and how to tell them apart. Psychopath and sociopath are often used interchangeably to refer to someone with an antisocial personality disorder. Here's a detailed answer to help you understand the differences between these two terms. A psychopath is a person with a specific type of antisocial personality disorder. Psychopaths are characterized by a lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse and oftentimes display manipulative behavior. They are also known to be highly egotistical, superficially charming, and skilled at manipulating others for their benefit. Psychopaths often lead seemingly normal lives, and they may even have successful careers and families, hiding their true nature from those around them. It is important to note that not all psychopaths are violent or commit crimes; however, they can cause emotional and psychological harm to others due to their lack of empathy. Studies have shown that psychopathy has a genetic component, and some experts believe that psychopaths have a defect in the brain's amygdala, which is responsible for processing emotions. A sociopath, on the other hand, also has antisocial personality disorder, but their condition is mainly shaped by environmental factors such as a traumatic childhood or an abusive upbringing. Sociopaths generally have less regard for social norms and rules, which often results in impulsive and erratic behavior. They may struggle to maintain meaningful relationships and may be more likely to become involved in criminal activities. Sociopaths can also be manipulative and charming, but their behavior is often less calculated and more spontaneous than that of a psychopath. Now, let's discuss the qualities and how to tell the difference between psychopaths and sociopaths: 1. Emotional Attachment: Psychopaths generally have no emotional attachment to others, while sociopaths might form emotional connections to a selected few, such as family or friends. 2. Guilt and Remorse: Psychopaths rarely feel guilt or remorse for their actions, no matter how harmful they may be. Sociopaths might feel some guilt or remorse, especially if their actions affect someone they care about. 3. Social Adaptability: Psychopaths are more socially sophisticated and adept at fitting in with their surroundings. They can maintain long-term relationships and successful careers while hiding their true nature. Sociopaths, however, are likely to have difficulty blending in and often struggle to maintain relationships and stable employment. 4. Impulsivity: Psychopaths are more calculated and controlled in their actions, carefully planning and executing their schemes. Sociopaths are more impulsive and unpredictable, acting on their desires with little regard for the consequences. 5. Violent Tendencies: While both psychopaths and sociopaths may engage in violent behavior, psychopaths are more likely to commit severe acts of violence. Sociopaths may resort to violence in response to environmental stressors or perceived threats, but their violent actions tend to be less organized and more reactive. In summary, while both psychopaths and sociopaths exhibit antisocial personality traits that can result in harmful behavior, there are differences in their emotional responses and levels of impulsivity. Psychopaths are typically more calculated and have a complete lack of empathy, while sociopaths may have emotional connections and demonstrate impulsive behavior. It is vital to remember that these two terms describe a spectrum of antisocial behavior, and individuals may exhibit varying degrees of these traits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: More than 100,000 people have bought ceramic poppies from the Tower of London's art installation that pays tribute to British and Commonwealth soldiers killed in the First World War. Sales of the poppies, from ceramic artist Paul Cummins' installation Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red, have raised more than £2.5million in just two days, the profits of which will go directly to six charities for servicemen and women. Today Mr Cummins, who works from his studio in Derbyshire, described the public reaction to his art, in which one poppy for each dead soldier is being placed in the dry moat at the Tower of London, as 'overwhelming'. Scroll down for video. Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red: Poppies from the installation at the Tower of London are selling fast. Each poppy is the size of a man's fist and attached to a two-foot metal stalk so it can be planted into the ground. 'I've been staggered by the response and support from members of the public,' he said. 'When I had the idea, I never imagined the reaction would be so overwhelming. 'I think that it is something everybody can relate to and they feel very personally about.' The artist had the idea for a 'sea of red' after reading the will of a Derbyshire man who joined up and died in Flanders. 'I don't know his name or where he was buried or anything about him,' said Cummins, who found the will among other old records in Chesterfield. 'But this line he wrote, when everyone he knew was dead and everywhere around him was covered in blood, jumped out at me: 'The blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread.' 'I believe he meant the angels to refer to his children.' Ceramic artists Paul Cummins, left, says he is 'staggered' by the public's reaction to his installation, which was visited byt the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Tuesday, right, the day it opened in London. The poppies, which are hand-sculpted and fixed to two-foot metal stalks, are currently being planted in the ground. By Armistice Day on November 11, there will be 888, 246, each one representing a British or colonial soldier, sailor or airmen who died in the Great War. The poppies are for sale for £25, and after Armistice Day they will be removed from the ground and sent to their buyers with a certificate. Online sales only opened on Tuesday, but staff at the Tower of London say more than 100,000 poppies have sold already, and demand is growing. Stunning: Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin kneels by a mass of ceramic poppies - each is being sold for £25. General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London: 'We're absolutely delighted with the response from the public.' Ten per cent of the sale price, plus all profits, will go to six service charities: Combat Stress, Coming Home, Help For Heroes, the Royal British Legion, SSAFA and the Confederation of Service Charities (Cobseo). A Tower of London spokesman said: 'The charities will receive ten per cent of every poppy sold. 'However, they will also receive an equal share of the net proceeds once all costs have been recovered. 'These are costs incurred by Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics in manufacturing, transporting, installing and selling the poppies as well as VAT. 'The ten per cent donation from each poppy, combined with the net proceeds, will raise millions of pounds for the six charities if all poppies are sold,and Historic Royal Palaces and Paul Cummins Ceramics will not profit from the sale of the poppies.' Volunteers began installing the poppies on Tuesday and will continue until Armistice Day. During this time, every night at twilight the names of 180 serving military are being read out in a roll of honour, followed by the Last Post bugle call played by a single bugler at Tower Hill terrace.

Write a title for this article: On Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) announced that the war in Syria had reached a grim milestone: Since the conflict began, they had documented the killing of 202,354 people. And as high as that number is, in a phone call with The Post, SOHR director Rami Abdul Rahman explained it was likely too low. He estimated that 280,000 people had actually died but his group had not been able to verify all the deaths among regime forces or in the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra. Either way, it's a terrible figure, and significantly up from SOHR's last estimate of 150,000 in April. But this new figure is also a reminder of how little we really know about the death toll in Syria -- and why the figures we do have can become politically controversial. International bodies have publicly struggled to count the dead in Syria. At the beginning of this year, the United Nations announced it would stop updating its death toll due to concerns about its accuracy (it had last been updated in July 2013, when it stood at 100,000). \\"It was always very close to the edge in terms of how much we could guarantee the source material was accurate,\\" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told the Associated Press. \\"And it reached a point where we felt we could no longer cross that line.\\" In August, UNHCR reversed that decision, and instead released a new report that said that 191,369 had died since the beginning of the conflict until April 2014, in part based on SOHR's figures. Colville then cautioned that the figures were “indicative” rather than “gospel truth.\\" On Tuesday, Abdul Rahman expressed doubt about the U.N.'s figures, and questioned why there was little detail about those who had died. \\"If you are collecting everything, then you should should show everything,\\" he said. Given the scarcity of reliable information from international organizations, activist-run groups like SOHR have filled the void. They are frequently cited in media reports and by government officials, yet outside observers might be surprised at how ad hoc their operation is: SOHR is based in Coventry, Britain, where Abdul Rahman settled when he fled Syria more than a decade ago. While Abdul Rahman coordinates everything from his British base, he says he uses a network in Syria to help collect and corroborate his information. Last year Abdul Rahman told the New York Times that he had four men working from inside Syria and a network of more than 230 activists on the ground. Abdul Rahman's methods have been criticized by others following the conflict. When the group released its 150,000 figure in April, James Miller, managing editor of the Interpreter and an expert on the Syrian conflict, tweeted a number of disparaging remarks. \\"Everything about that chart screams BS!\\" he tweeted at one point, before explaining that he knew \\"field reporters who have never encountered a SOHR source in Syria.\\" \\"There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of examples why [SOHR] is a terrible source,\\" Miller explained in a follow-up email to The Post, before citing a list of his own criticism, including that moderate rebels were listed as civilians in the data – an apparent change to the methodology that was also noted by Micah Zenko at the Council of Foreign Relations. Miller argued that the way SOHR broke down their numbers between civilians and jihadists showed that they were \\"significantly less objective\\" than other groups tracking data, though he added that their bias was unclear. Abdul Rahman is generally perceived to be in opposition to Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, but at times the motivation behind SOHR can seem more complex. Recently, the organization began drawing attention to what it said were civilian deaths created by U.S. airstrikes. That created an awkward situation for the United States, which had frequently cited the organization's statistics. \\"Nobody is happy with our work, because nobody wants the truth to come out,\\" Abdul Rahman told the Huffington Post in November. \\"Our group doesn't have the whole truth, but we are very close.\\" Perhaps the most common criticism of SOHR is that it doesn't share its data or methodology, meaning that it is difficult, if not impossible, to check. There is not much to check it against, anyway: The next most prominent group counting the number of deaths in Syria is the Violations Documenting Center (VDC). \\"They basically endeavor to have more than one activist in a location, and the activists are not in touch,\\" Lama Fakih of Human Rights Watch told the New Republic approvingly last year. \\"They collect info separately, and they use that separate analysis to corroborate the info they’re receiving.” VDC's website currently estimates that 108,679 \\"revolutionary martyrs\\" have been killed. Bassam al-Ahmad, a spokesperson for the VDC, told The Post earlier this year that SOHR's numbers seem realistic, but their own methods for confirming the dead are relatively strict (for example, they only count those whose names they can confirm) and thus skew lower. Counting the dead in any conflict is difficult. Estimates for the number of dead in the Iraq war can range between 110,937 (on the low end of the Iraq Body Count project estimate) to 655,000 (from an especially controversial 2006 Lancet study), and the methodologies of estimates can be political – one recent report suggested that the death tolls from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Darfur conflict were deliberately exaggerated. Such discrepancies are hardly a new phenomenon: Estimates for the number of Germans who died in World War II can vary between 4 million and 5.3 million, for example. \\"I think in a way social media has raised some people's expectations when it come to verifying deaths,\\" Eliot Higgins, a British blogger who has tracked the war under the name Moses Brown, wrote in an email. \\"With so many deaths shown in pictures and videos, it seems some people are unwilling just to accept numbers any more, they want videos of corpses before they'll accept anything. It sort of creates an unrealistic expectation of what's required to verify a death in a conflict like Syria, and really people will believe the figures they want to believe.\\" There still remains hope that one day people in Syria will face trial for war crimes, however, and evidence on deaths collected by SOHR and other groups may prove important. Sadly, it appears that there are few critics who think SOHR's estimates are too low. Some think they should be higher. Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

How is \\"Well, what are you waiting for?\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Well, what are you waiting for?\\" is translated as \\"No, na co čekáš?\\". Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Well\\" is translated to \\"No\\" (pronounced as \\"noh\\") in Czech. It serves as an interjection to initiate a sentence and to indicate a sense of impatience or urgency, similarly to the way it is used in English. 2. \\"What\\" is translated to \\"co\\" (pronounced as \\"tso\\"), which serves as an interrogative pronoun to ask questions about things or actions in this context. 3. \\"Are you waiting\\" is translated to \\"čekáš\\" (pronounced as \\"chek-ah-sh\\"), which is a present tense, second person singular form of the verb \\"čekat\\" (to wait). In Czech, the verb conjugation already includes the person, so there's no need for a separate word for \\"you\\" in the sentence. 4. \\"For\\" is translated to \\"na\\" (pronounced as \\"na\\") in this context. It's a preposition that can have various meanings and is used here to indicate the purpose or intention of waiting. So, the complete sentence \\"No, na co čekáš?\\" (pronounced as \\"noh, na tso chek-ah-sh\\") conveys the meaning of \\"Well, what are you waiting for?\\" in Czech.

In the first question, \\"fun things to do in Dallas, TX on weekends\\" implies a broad range of activities that cater to a wide variety of interests and preferences for individuals or groups. Possible suggestions might include visiting museums, attending concerts or live performances, exploring local attractions, shopping, dining out, or participating in sports and outdoor activities.

Examples of such activities might include visiting dog parks, going on dog-friendly hikes or nature walks, checking out dog-friendly restaurants or cafes, or participating in events designed for dogs and their owners. Overall, the difference in context and focus make these two questions distinct, and as such, tailored recommendations and suggestions for each question should be provided appropriately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stop smoking Treat the underlying cause.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: 5 Key Steps to Promote a Healthy Lifestyle and Improve Well-Being Introduction: Our modern lives can be characterized by fast-paced schedules and high levels of stress, making it increasingly challenging to stay committed to our health and well-being. However, by making small, manageable changes in our day-to-day routines, we can continue to prioritize our health while significantly improving our overall well-being. Here are five critical steps to embrace a healthier lifestyle that will inevitably lead to a more fulfilling and robust livelihood. 1. Exercise in Moderation The idea of maintaining a regular exercise routine is often seen as a daunting commitment. However, physical activity does not have to be rigorous to be beneficial. Engaging in moderate exercise, such as going for a 30-minute walk, participating in yoga classes, or cycling, can significantly boost heart health and help in weight management. Encouraging a balance between activity and relaxation allows us to improve our health without becoming overwhelmed, making long-term commitment more feasible and enjoyable. 2. Donate Blood Regularly Blood donation is an altruistic act that not only helps save lives, but also offers a myriad of health benefits for donors. Regular blood donations can help lower blood viscosity, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and strokes. Furthermore, donating blood may detect potential health problems and allow for early diagnosis and treatment. By incorporating blood donation into our lives, we can support others while taking care of our own health. 3. Take a Mini Aspirin Daily In recent years, there has been a growing body of research supporting the benefits of taking a low-dose or \\"mini\\" aspirin daily. This small addition to your routine can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke for those prone to these conditions. Consult your doctor to determine if incorporating a mini aspirin regimen is beneficial for your particular circumstances and to understand the potential side effects and precautions. 4. Stick to Lower Ground While reaching great heights in our careers or personal lives can be exciting, living at a high altitude might not be the healthiest choice. High altitude living creates more stress on the lungs and heart, leading to increased heart rate and shortness of breath. To maintain a healthy cardiovascular system, choosing to reside at a lower altitude can minimize the health risks associated with high-altitude living. 5. Stop Smoking and Treat the Underlying Cause Smoking is a widely recognized risk factor for numerous health issues, including lung and heart diseases. Quitting smoking has immediate and long-term benefits, such as improving lung function and reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. However, smoking can be just a symptom of a more profound underlying cause. Anxiety, depression, or addiction can trigger nicotine use as a coping mechanism. It is crucial to address these root causes through seeking professional help or utilizing healthy coping strategies to ensure a successful and lasting recovery from smoking. Conclusion: These five simple steps showcase that taking charge of our health and well-being does not have to involve drastic lifestyle changes. By incorporating these practices into our daily lives with patience and perseverance, we can embark on a rewarding journey towards improved health and a more enriched existence. So, exercise in moderation, give blood, take that mini aspirin, live on lower ground, and conquer those underlying issues - and watch your well-being soar."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

A recent study published by a Casablanca support group for single mothers says the number of Morocco's unmarried mothers in 2009 is at least double those in 2008 -- 27,200 compared with 11,016 the year before, according to the Institution Nationale de Solidarite Avec Les Femmes en Distresse. As in most Muslim countries, it is considered an intolerable shame on a family in Morocco if a daughter falls pregnant outside marriage. In many cases, families totally reject a daughter who becomes pregnant before marriage. Morocco's unmarried mothers are mostly young, said Houda El Bourahi, the institute's director. The study shows 60% are younger than 26 and a third younger than 20, she said. According to the 350-page report, the mothers are often in \\"vulnerable\\" professions, such as house servants, and the majority have a low level of schooling. Often, the women believe that their sexual partners will marry them, and so agree to their demands, according to the study. Despite Morocco being modern in so many respects, strong prejudice still remains against unwed mothers from most groups of society. \\"It's time to put an end to prejudices held against these women though who are considered by (Moroccan) society as prostitutes,\\" El Bourahi said. \\"These women are rejected by their families and by society and are not protected by the law.\\" Since the end of last year, 7,000 women in Casablanca alone had been assisted at the organization's Center of Listening on the outskirts of the city, the commercial capital of Morocco with a population of almost 4 million. Furthermore, 2,000 children have been accepted legally by the civil state and 540 have been recognized by their fathers. The women's rights agenda has accelerated dramatically in recent years in Morocco largely following an initiative by King Mohammed VI to give women more equality, both at home and in the workplace. A new law adopted in 2004 gave women more rights as wives, for example. Still, few men accept unmarried mothers and their offspring despite less of a stigma these days toward women who take up jobs and consider virginity to be an outdated virtue. While many men consider single mothers to be prostitutes, sex workers reportedly represent a tiny percentage of Morocco's unmarried mothers. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"This article talks about how single mothers in Morocco are increasing in number. In 2009, there were more than double the unmarried moms compared to 2008. This is a big issue because in Morocco, like in many Muslim countries, it's considered very bad for a girl to have a baby before she gets married. Many times, their families don't want them anymore. Most of these single moms are young and have a low level of education. They often believe that they will get married to the father of their baby, but that doesn't always happen. Even though Morocco has made some progress in giving women more rights, single moms still face a lot of problems from society and the law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The suggested answer provided a brief description of the geologic time scale but did not precisely list the four main eras of time nor identify which one we currently live in. To give a more complete and detailed answer, let me provide you with the information you're looking for. The geologic history of Earth is split into four primary eras: the Precambrian, the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. These eras span across billions of years and encompass significant geological, climatic, and evolutionary changes that have shaped our planet. 1. Precambrian Era: This era refers to the time period from Earth's formation, about 4.6 billion years ago, to the beginning of the Paleozoic Era, around 541 million years ago. The Precambrian covers the longest duration of Earth's history and is further divided into three eons, the Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic. During this era, Earth witnessed the formation of its initial crust, the emergence of single-celled life, and the appearance of early multicellular organisms. 2. Paleozoic Era: This era spans from approximately 541 million to 252 million years ago. It marks the beginning of complex life, with the diversification of organisms during the Cambrian explosion. The Paleozoic Era is further divided into six periods, including the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian. This era saw the emergence of various marine creatures, the evolution of fish, land plants and early reptiles, the formation of coal forests, and ended with the most significant mass extinction event in Earth’s history, the Permian-Triassic extinction. 3. Mesozoic Era: Lasting from about 252 million to 66 million years ago, the Mesozoic Era is also known as the \\"Age of Reptiles.\\" This era consists of three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. During the Mesozoic Era, Earth experienced the reign of dinosaurs, the emergence of mammals, advanced reptiles, and the initial diversification of birds. The Mesozoic Era concluded with the mass extinction event that led to the destruction of the majority of dinosaurs. 4. Cenozoic Era: The final era, which is the one we currently live in, began around 66 million years ago and continues to the present day. The Cenozoic Era is sometimes referred to as the \\"Age of Mammals\\" due to the rapid evolution and diversification of mammals following the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic Era. The Cenozoic Era is split into three periods: the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary. During this time, the world has witnessed the rise of mammals, the evolution of primates, and the appearance of modern human Homo sapiens, as well as significant changes in Earth's climate, including the Ice Age. In conclusion, the four primary eras in Earth's geological history are the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. We currently live in the Cenozoic Era, which has been marked by the rapid development of mammals and the rise of humans as a dominant species.

Premise: 1. \\"Two young boys\\" - We have a clear subject that consists of two young boys engaged in an activity. 2. \\"paddle on the water\\" - This indicates that the boys are manually propelling themselves on a body of water, which is likely navigable by other watercraft. 3. \\"in an older, beaten boat\\" - The boat the boys are using is described as old and worn, suggesting it might be of lesser value or quality in comparison to other boats. 4. \\"a large, expensive yacht\\" - We have another subject: a luxurious watercraft that contrasts sharply with the boys' older, beaten boat in terms of size, value, and quality. 5. \\"holds a man who is fishing\\" - Onboard the yacht, there is a man engaged in the leisurely activity of fishing. Hypothesis: 1. \\"Two boys\\" - The same subjects as in the premise, specifying two individuals. 2. \\"in a decrepit boat\\" - The term \\"decrepit\\" is synonymous with \\"old\\" and \\"worn\\" as mentioned in the premise. This further highlights the contrast between the two boats. 3. \\"paddle\\" - This action connects with the premise in which the boys use paddles to maneuver the older boat. 4. \\"near a yacht\\" - This indicates the spatial relationship between the boys' boat and the luxurious yacht. \\"Near\\" suggests that the two watercraft are within a close distance of each other. By comparing the elements of the premise with those of the hypothesis, we can deduce that they align and the hypothesis is supported. The common elements include the presence of two young boys, their manual paddling on an older, beaten (or decrepit) boat, and the close proximity of a luxurious yacht containing a man who is fishing. Thus, we can reasonably conclude that the hypothesis \\"Two boys in a decrepit boat paddle near a yacht\\" can be deduced from the given premise, as it contains the main subjects, their activities, and the relationship between the two boats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, The Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well. The half-hour-long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. The monologue segment is often followed by a segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent--typically introduced as the show's \\"senior\\" specialist in the subject at hand--either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location in front of a greenscreen showing stock footage. Their stated areas of expertise vary depending on the news story that is being discussed, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme stereotypes of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as \\"Senior Latino Correspondent\\", \\"Senior Youth Correspondent\\" or \\"Senior Black Correspondent\\". They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's straight man. While correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a greenscreen background, on rare occasions, cast members have recorded pieces on location. For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called \\"Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq\\" in which correspondent Rob Riggle reported from Iraq. In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled \\"Rob Riggle: Chasing the Dragon\\", which focused on the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Jason Jones traveled to Iran in early June 2009 to report on the Iranian elections, and John Oliver traveled to South Africa for the series of segments \\"Into Africa\\" to report on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, John Oliver traveled to Gabon, on the west African coast, to report on the Gabonese government's decision to donate 2 million to UNESCO after the United States cut its funding for UNESCO earlier that year. On July 19, 2016, Roy Wood Jr. reported live from the Republican National Convention and talked about Donald Trump's African-American support. Correspondent segments feature a rotating supporting cast, and involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue. Topics have varied widely; during the early years of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as Bigfoot enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates. Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of The Daily Show. However, as the show began to gain popularity--particularly following its coverage of the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections--most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element. Is there anything else significant about the correspondent segments?","completion":"Yes, there are several other significant aspects of the correspondent segments on The Daily Show. Some of these include: 1. Launching careers: The Daily Show has been instrumental in launching the careers of numerous comedians and actors who began as correspondents. Some notable former correspondents who went on to achieve great success in the entertainment industry include Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, John Oliver, Rob Corddry, Samantha Bee, Ed Helms, and Hasan Minhaj, among others. 2. Diversity and representation: The correspondent segments feature a diverse cast that has included individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations. This diversity allows the show to address a wide range of topics from unique perspectives, which can help foster greater understanding and empathy among viewers. It also provides a platform for marginalized voices to make their presence felt in mainstream media. 3. Parody and satire: Correspondent segments often involve comedic exaggerations, parodies, and satirical portrayals of real-life personalities, political figures, and media pundits. Such portrayals serve to highlight the absurdities and biases that may exist in news coverage and political discourse, encouraging audiences to question the information they are presented with and adopt a more critical mindset. 4. In-depth reporting: Despite the comedic nature of the show, correspondents occasionally delve into serious issues and engage in fact-based, investigative journalism. These segments can provide informative and well-researched coverage of important topics, offering viewers valuable insights into complex matters. 5. Human interest stories: Throughout its history, The Daily Show correspondent segments have featured character-driven human interest stories that have resonated with viewers by showcasing the experiences and perspectives of individuals from diverse backgrounds. These segments can serve to provide a refreshing counterpoint to the show's political satire, offering moments of heartfelt connection, humor, and empathy. 6. Provoking thought and discussion: The correspondent segments of The Daily Show have, at times, sparked important conversations and reflection on significant issues. By offering alternative viewpoints on various topics, these segments can encourage viewers to reassess their own beliefs and challenge conventional wisdom. In summary, The Daily Show correspondent segments have played a crucial role in shaping the show's identity, contributing to its success, and making it a cultural touchstone. They have provided a platform for numerous emerging talents, offered diverse perspectives on a wide range of topics, and combined humor with thought-provoking content to keep audiences engaged and entertained."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Real Wheels Live Saab sport combi wagon: Hi Warren - a former Postie here: I love my Mini, but it's just too small to embark on road trips with two dogs (Border terriers), their accoutrements and luggage for two people. Do you have an opinion on the new Saab Aero 9-3 or it's less expensive (relatively speaking) 2.0T? I've admired my neighbor's older 9-5 multi-use because of the longer length and comfortable ride, but that model's production has ended and I find the coming Mini SUV laughable. Photobabe Warren Brown: Good morning:You need a wagon or crossover utility model, of which (speaking of the CUVs) there are many for considerably less than the 37,020 you'd be asked to pay for the Saab Aero Wagon. You can statr with the usual suspects: Chevrolet Equinox/GMC Terrain, Honda CRV, Hyundai Santa Fe, Kia Sorento, Toyota Rav-4, all of which are very good and should meet your purposes. But if you insist on spending 37,020, take a vtrip to Land Rover and look at the new LR4, perfect for long highway drives with loveable dogs. Happy motoring. Compact Luxury SUV/Crossovers?: I have a 2004 Cadillac SRX. What are the good new compact, luxury crossovers/SUVs, possibly a hybrid? Warren Brown: I went into the market, using my own money, to check out affordable wagon hybrids. \\"Affordable\\" means 40,000 tops for me. I think I'm going to settle on the Ford Escape Hybrid. It's priced right, 29,865 base. It takes a heck of a beating and carries lots of stuff. And, nearly 1,000 into my summer-long rental from Enterprise (which is how I shop for cars), it actually delivers nearly 40 mpg on the highway. Plus, its easy as heck to drive in the city. Equinox/GMC Terrain (you'd really be cheating yourself not to look at those). Customer service: Warren-I have been treated very poorly by the service department of the car dealership where I bought my Prius less than a year ago. They performed an unnecessary oil change, then said that corporate Toyota would send me a coupon to cover the cost, which has never appeared. I have achieved somewhat of a resolution after six months, many phone calls, coming to the dealer in person, and have been met with an inordinate amount of rudeness and ineptness at several levels. What would be the best websites to warn other potential customers about this dealership? Warren Brown: We'll post your complaint here. I cannot possibly understand why any business would treat any customer the way you've been treated. It just makes no sense. Write that dealer a letter. Please send a copy to me at OrleansLaTete@gmail.com. We'll find a way to get you some satisfaction.Geez! What gives? You have a good customer. Why treat her or him like something less? Crazy! diesel engines: Any idea when we're going to see more of the new diesel engines, in more vehicles? They're 30% more efficient than gasoline engines and they're not the diesel engines of the '70's (cough cough gag). Hey, for the microbrewer in many of us, we can even make our own fuel if we cozy up with a restaurant for their grease. Warren Brown: fuel in this country runs at 2.96 per gallon (average) compared with 2.74 per gallon for less-efficient gasoline. Nuts!As long as that kind of foolishness keeps up, diesel will be a slow slog coming to the USA. SUVs: Warren,I know you really liked the Santa Fe. How do you think the Escape compares? (I'm looking for a small-ish people/stuff mover.) Warren Brown: how much I like it. Fuel economy is great, close to 40 mpg highway, which is where I do most of my driving. We've made multiple dump runs in the thing. It's easy to clean up. It handles perfectly in city traffic. We do wish that Ford would use less plastic in the interior. But we lonhg ago got over that complaint. We genuinely like this one. 2008 Audi A6 branded title: Warren-Hi. This is a follow up to my submission last week about the undisclosed branded title on my dealer purchased, not certified, pre-owned 2008 Audi A6. I had asked what effect branded title had on value and resale. I'm debating whether to demand delaer take back car or have it certify vehicle instead. I like the car and at least with the second option, I'd be covered if any latent damage issue gives me future problems. Thanks in advance for your help.Scarsdale, NY Warren Brown: Go back to the dealer with your complaint, which seems logical to me. Have him or her make the appropriate adjustment. Leave happy. To the dealer: Want to retain customers and reduce your advertising costs? Handle the complaint with competence and a smile, even if it costs you a few dollars. Dealers who do that don't have to worry about advertising rates. You make the customer feel good. That makes us look good. Everybody's happy. Want to help my brother : He lives in NYC and has a VERY old mazda that has served him well, but, needs to soon be put out to field. He has 2 junior high school kids, a disabled wife, and needs safety/security. He drives in the city and also out to see friends/relatives outside new york and even to see me here in DC. Safety is a big concern of his, as well as being able to fit luggage and a wheelchair. Any recommendations? Thanks as always! Warren Brown: I salute you and your brother. And I hereby direct you both to Subaru, for either a Forester wagon or an Outback. Both are all-wheel-drive. And what I love so much about Subaru is its dedication to making sure that families dealing with physical challenges are properly situated in the right vehicle. Hyundai: My daughter is thinking of getting an Elantra. I am not familar with thier maintenance track record. As she will be at college the next few years, extra repairs are something she hopes to avoid. Warren Brown: The Elantra is a good car. It has all of the appropriate safety equipment. It also has what is arguably the best repair warrany in the business, which should give you and your daughter peace of mind. Recommendation: Have your daughter check with AAA or with her university to enroll in a defensive driving course. Most of today's cars and trucks are pretty darned safe. I cannot say the same thing for most of today's drivers. Ford Escape: Would be nice if Ford didn't go cheap and put in rear drum brakes. No other competitors have rear drum brakes. Problem with the escape is the Ford bean counters cut lots of corners on this vehcile which you will pay for later.Clifton, VA Warren Brown: I agree with you 100 percent, Clifton. What's up with that, Ford? You are turning out all of these great products. But you go cheap on us with disc brakes up front and obsolete, less effective drums in the rear. Trust me, Ford penny pinchers, most of us don't mind paying extra for the extra protection we get with FOUR -WHEEL disc brakes. Thanks for bringing it up, Clifton. New Saab 9-5: Hi Warren, I've started seeing reviews pop up online on the new Saab 9-5 and they've all been very complimentary. Curious to know if you'll be in one soon as it seems to have a lot going for it. Thanks! Warren Brown: I will be in one, soon. And I'll let you know what I find. Mazda3: Your thoughts on the Mazda3.....interested in purchasing it new or used, but if used, I would buy after 2007-2008. Warren Brown: If you love small-car excellence, you will love that one. But, be warned: Mazda3 owners tend to drive their cars hard. Keep that in mind when buying used. Make sure you have a mechanic check it out, regardless of the year of make. ÂÂs a guy to do? Warren Brown: Don't blame BMW. Blame your Member of Congress. Blame the absence of a national energy policy. What we need to do is LOBBY FOR OURSELVES. We don't need those K-Street firms. We want diesel. We know that diesel is more efficient than gasoline. We know diesel offers more advantages than gas-electric hybrids. We need to push Congress to recognize diesel's advantages and make it easier for consumers to acquire and use advanced diesel vehicles. Congress is supposed to work for us, not the other way around. Let's start a letter-writing campaign! Family Truckster, Part II: I wrote in last week asking for advice on a 3-row family car, and asking your opinion about the Ford Flex. I appreciate you taking the question, but rather than answering you told me not to be afraid of a minivan. I was not trying to ask an existential question, as I would be perfectly happy with a minivan and I generally know which ones get better reviews than others. I was asking specifically what you thought of the Flex, and whether it is a good alternative to a minivan. It seems like it has many of the perks without all the bulk. Care to offer an opinion on the Flex? Warren Brown: But the AWD version most of us would favor starts at 36,720. Diesel or hybrid would add 6,000 to that. Veracruz versus traverse?: Hi Mr. Brown,I love your columns and chats. My husband and I have two kids and we own a camry. It's a good reliable car, but we wanted a crossover for when our parents visit, we like to have a third row for extra people. We test drove the traverse and veracruz. I fell in love with the Traverse, (especially living in Houston, the AC seats). I liked the veracruz as well, but not as much as the Traverse. My husband liked both, but is leaning towards the Veracruz, only because of reliability, (it has a 10 year warranty, etc.). What are your thoughts? Warren Brown: sit in the third-row seats of the Veracruz. Now, try the Traverse--more room and, in my estimation, safer third-row seats in the Traverse. And I wouldn't worry about reliability or ease of repair. GM copied Hyundai here. GM also has a very good warranty on the Traverse. No Warren that is LR2: The LR 4 costs about 55k.The best vehicle for hauling dogs is restored and repowered with a turbo diesel Defender 110. Prices start at 120k. Google East Coast Rover Co.Clifton, VA Warren Brown: Ah, Clifton, my friend, not everyone has your time, money, or affection for tinkering. But we're happy to count you among our congregation. Thanks. crossovers: Looking to cash in my GM points...thoughts on the Enclave v. Traverse? I like the looks of the Enclave better, but don't know if it's work the extra money. Warren Brown: you just want to haul people and stuff, take the aptly named and well-designed Traverse. Re: Saab Sportcombi: I've owned a 9-5 Sportcombi for several years, which I bought used as a certified model. We've been looking at getting a newer used one which are terrific deals, often in the mid-teens in terms of price, much lower than the new cars you cited. Something to think about when comparing cars. Warren Brown: We thank you. SUVs with third row of seats: Good Morning! My husband and I are in the market for a family SUV with a third row of seats. We've been thinking about the Enclave, Acadia, Pilot, etc. Having a nice, smooth ride is important to us, as is a certain amount of luxury. But of course we'd like to find a good deal. Do you have a favorite SUV of that size? Also, we'd like to have this car for our family vacation in August, but I'm wondering if we'd save money by waiting until the end of the year. Any thoughts on timing and when you can get the best deals? Thank you! Warren Brown: In that size, I favor the Traverse, because I don't like to spend any more than I have to spend. But if I had it to spend, I'd take the Enclave in a heartbeat, or maybe the GMC Acadia. Keep in mind that all of the models mentioned in this passage are built on the same platform. Hyundai v. Hyundai: Quick question: which do you think is the better value: Hyundai Sonata v. Hyundai Tucson? Help me decide, please! Warren Brown: The Sonata is a sedan. The Tucson is a wagon/crossover utility vehicle. Which do you want? 4 door Jeep Wrangler: Warren, i have my mind set on a 4 door jeep wrangler. I don't drive much, but have wanted one forever. Am i crazy to follow my dream? Warren Brown: You and my wife have a similar dream. You're both crazy. Here's why: The Wrangler is ill-designed for routine city-commuter use. It's excellent for off-road driving. But I suspect that the chances of your going off-road is about as good as my wife's, which is nil to none. You guys need counseling. Safe drivers: Most of today's cars and trucks are pretty darned safe. I cannot say the same thing for most of today's drivers.Hah! That made me spit out my drink. And why do you think today's drivers are not safe? Too many distractions in the vehicle, or a cultural thing? Aggresive driving now being a badge of honor, for example. Warren Brown: Laziness. Selfishness. Failure to obey the commandment to \\"Love thy neighbor as I love you.\\" Behind the wheel, that means sharing the road, watching out for the other guy, obeying the rules of the road. We don't do enough of that. Now, please, clean up your drink. Rockville, MD: Hi Warren:Two things:1. I have not considered a crossover or suv because I consider a sedan's trunk as less likely to be broken into because contents are not visible. Is this a silly idea?2. If the Prius person with customer service problems is in the DC area, send comments to the Washington Consumer Checkbook. Warren Brown: .1 Yours is not a silly idea, which is why most CUV models have darkened rear windows.. 2 Thank you.. Thank you all for joining us today. Please come back next week. Thank you Sakina for another fine production. Thank you, Ria, for your tremendous patience and service.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Semma OK\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is difficult to provide a specific star rating for the review \\"Semma OK\\" without more context or information about the criteria being evaluated. However, here is a general analysis of this review and possible interpretations: \\"Semma\\" is a colloquial Tamil term that translates to \\"very\\" or \\"extremely\\" in English. \\"OK\\" is a commonly used word to express that something is acceptable or satisfactory. Putting these two words together, we can deduce that the reviewer is expressing that something is \\"very acceptable\\" or \\"extremely satisfactory.\\" Based on this interpretation, it seems like the reviewer had a better-than-average experience, and it was not just \\"OK\\" but \\"Semma OK.\\" So, considering the scale of ★ (lowest) to ★★★★★ (highest), we could assign the following potential ratings: 1. If we focus mostly on the \\"OK\\" part of the review and assume that Semma adds a little value to an average experience, it might fall in the ★★ or ★★★ brackets, representing a slightly above average rating. 2. If we give more importance to the term \\"Semma\\" and its emphasis on the \\"very\\" or \\"extremely\\" part, then a ★★★★ rating might be suitable to indicate the experience was indeed very satisfactory. From these possibilities, one could argue that the review \\"Semma OK\\" could potentially represent a rating between ★★ and ★★★★. However, it is crucial to evaluate this in conjunction with other reviews and context available to reach a more accurate conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

Please write a short summary for the following article: An unexpected look into Cambodian rock before the killing fields “When we were young, we loved being modern,” an unseen female narrator says at the start of “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll,” the 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi. The words are spoken in Khmer, Cambodia’s official language, and translated onscreen, accompanied by stark graphics and ominously rumbling music composed by Scot Stafford. “Then Pol Pot took over Phnom Penh in 1975,” the narrator continues. “I was a singer.” An old photograph of a lovely young woman, smiling and chic, materializes slowly, its sepia tone connoting faded memories. There is a surprise waiting in “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten,” a labor of love that Pirozzi painstakingly assembled over a span of close to a decade, although the story it tells holds no mystery. Anyone who knows the history of modern Cambodia — its peaceful liberation from French occupation in 1953, its rush to modernization under the culturally enlightened monarch Norodom Sihanouk, the incursion of the Vietnam War, and the blood-soaked rise to power of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge regime, which exacted a horrific toll on intellectuals and artists in particular — will understand that Pirozzi’s topic is not the stuff of happy endings. photo from personal collection of Mol Kamach The band Baksey Cham Krong in the film “Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock & Roll.” The surprise, then, is how much tangible evidence of a thriving, joyous Cambodian musical scene the director was able to retrieve and bring to light. Pirozzi, who became aware of Cambodian pop while working on Matt Dillon’s feature film “City of Ghosts” in 2001, pursued his subject with a detective’s resourcefulness and a music nerd’s gusto. In a previous documentary, “Sleepwalking Through the Mekong” (2007), he took the members of Dengue Fever, a Los Angeles band inspired by vintage Khmer pop, to Cambodia, the native land of its lead singer, Chhom Nimol, and tracked down some of the surviving artists of that era. Some of the biggest names in Cambodian pop, understandably, were no longer around to participate — in particular Sinn Sisamouth, a suave, prolific, and trend-setting singer who might be considered the Khmer Sinatra, and who is presumed to have died in the Killing Fields. But Pirozzi located and interviewed witnesses, scholars, and a key handful of musicians, such as Sieng Vanthy. Hers, it turns out, are the voice and the image that open the film. In a gripping interview, Vanthy, who died in 2009, reveals that she’d survived an encounter with the Khmer Rouge by claiming to be a banana merchant. Through miraculously preserved film footage, as well as old photographs and album covers, we are introduced to a lively, swinging milieu that suits perfectly Cambodia’s embrace of all things modern in the ’50s. Its participants — artists and listeners alike — are young and happy, their adoption of French and English styles, Latin American influences, and American appropriations adept and joyous. Viewers will delight in discovering acts like the twangy Baksey Cham Krong, Cambodia’s eminent surf-guitar combo, and the heavier, funkier Drakkar — both of which have reunited to reap unexpected benefits provided by screenings of Pirozzi’s film. The music, the stuff of cultish collectors for decades, is thrilling. And although there is genuine horror in the way that many of these luminaries were cast into shadow, prematurely and brutally, there remains a certain triumph to be had in Pirozzi’s film. It offers confirmation, if not exactly consolation, that brighter efforts of the human spirit can sometimes persevere. • ‘The Look of Silence’ revisits the 1965 Indonesian genocide • Following the path of justice in Florida in ‘3½ Minutes, Ten Bullets’ • In ‘The Tribe,’ a school for the deaf becomes the world","completion":"\\"Don't Think I've Forgotten: Cambodia's Lost Rock & Roll\\" is a 2014 documentary film directed by John Pirozzi that delves into the unexpected world of Cambodian rock before the rise of the Khmer Rouge regime under Pol Pot.

Is A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that: a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, a 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer is a good answer to the question, but it can be elaborated upon for a more detailed and comprehensive response: Throughout history, various individuals and organizations have reported and documented the treatment of Aborigines in Australia. One such significant account is from Sir Baldwin Spencer, a British-Australian anthropologist, who wrote a report on the status and treatment of Aboriginal people in 1913. However, several other reports and accounts can provide further insight into the treatment of Aborigines. 1. Sir Baldwin Spencer's 1913 report: Sir Baldwin Spencer, a prominent anthropologist, and biologist, was appointed as the special commissioner for Aboriginal affairs in the Northern Territory in 1913. In his report, he painted a grim picture of the living conditions and dire situation faced by Indigenous Australians during that time. His observations detailed the impact of European settlers, dispossession of land, and the decline of traditional culture. The report revealed issues such as exploitation, violence, and discrimination against the Aboriginal people. It called for significant changes in government policy to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. 2. Humanitarian groups and organizations: Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, missionary groups and other religious organizations were actively involved in reporting the ill-treatment of Aborigines. These organizations often emphasized the need for protection and education for Indigenous Australians, voicing concerns over forced labor, abuse, and living conditions. Several church publications and personal accounts of missionaries provided firsthand accounts of the mistreatment of Aboriginal people. 3. Royal Commissions and inquiries: There have been numerous government inquiries and Royal Commissions, which have investigated various aspects of Aboriginal affairs. For instance, the 1967 referendum led to constitutional changes to recognize Aboriginal people as equal citizens. This, in turn, resulted in a sense of responsibility on the government to investigate and improve the treatment of Aborigines. Major investigations, like the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (1987-1991) and the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families (led by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1997), exposed the systematic mistreatment and racism experienced by Aboriginal people. 4. Personal accounts and writings: Many Indigenous Australians have shared their experiences through autobiographies, literary works, and other forms of storytelling. These accounts provide unique and personal insight into the treatment of Aboriginal people throughout history. Notable examples include the works of authors such as Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Jack Davis, and Archie Weller, whose writings emphasize the hurt and suffering of Indigenous Australians due to discrimination, cultural loss, and historical trauma. In summary, while Sir Baldwin Spencer's 1913 report is an important documentation of how Aborigines were treated, it is essential to consider and acknowledge the many other reports, inquiries, and personal accounts that further reveal the injustices faced by Indigenous Australians. These various sources highlight the need for greater understanding, awareness, and advocacy for Aboriginal people and their rights."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In such cases, it is important to communicate concerns and seek clarification in order to prevent misunderstandings, encourage meaningful conversations, and promote more efficient decision-making. There are several steps that can be taken to ensure that agendas are clear and functional for the meetings they accompany: 1. Outline the agenda items in advance: Provide an overview of the topics to be discussed during the meeting, along with any related subpoints or necessary background information. 2. Use concise, unambiguous language: Clearly define each agenda item, avoiding jargon, acronyms, or any other language that may be unfamiliar to meeting participants. This will help ensure that everyone understands the subject matter and can actively participate in the discussion. 3. Prioritize agenda items: Arrange the topics in order of importance or urgency to facilitate efficient use of time and ensure that critical matters are addressed first. 4. Allocate time for each item: Estimate how long each topic will take to discuss and assign appropriate time limits for each agenda item. This helps keep the meeting on track and ensures that all subjects are adequately covered. 5. Include time for questions and comments: Create opportunities for meeting participants to ask questions or provide input on agenda items, fostering an open exchange of ideas and promoting a collaborative atmosphere. 6. Distribute the agenda ahead of time: Share the finalized agenda with all meeting attendees well in advance, allowing them to review the upcoming topics and prepare for the discussions.

They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but six-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.The truck won't start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window.

Hansen's biography of the astronaut. Also starring The Crown's Claire Foy, the film has won over critics, who give it an 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. What to expect: At CNN, Brian Lowry calls First Man \\"a dazzling accomplishment, from the cinematography to the musical score\\" and one of the year's best movies. \\"The buttoned-up nature of the character puts Gosling to the test, but he conveys a great deal with mere glances and expressions,\\" he writes. Chazelle, meanwhile, \\"keeps the focus squarely on the protagonist and the mission.\\" Gosling \\"turns in a discreet, sensitive performance\\" that might fit his character, but \\"the movie feels too fussed-over for such a low-key hero,\\" Stephanie Zacharek writes at Time. There are \\"too many feelings, even for those of us who like them,\\" continues Zacharek, who felt Chazelle's emphasis on the 1968 death of Armstrong's 2-year-old daughter from a brain tumor didn't mesh with the astronaut's private nature. On the opposite side of the fence, Colin Covert at the Minneapolis Star Tribune applauds the \\"tremendous personal insight\\" given to Armstrong, aided by Gosling, who \\"digs down to the man's bone marrow.\\" Foy is just as \\"excellent\\" as Armstrong's wife, Janet.

Expand this summary.","completion":"\\"First Man\\" sees Ryan Gosling, the versatile actor from \\"La La Land\\", return under the direction of Damien Chazelle. This time, Gosling portrays Neil Armstrong and is based on the biography of the astronaut by James R. Hansen. The film is a critical success, garnering an impressive 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and winning the hearts of many film critics. At the core of the rave reviews is the movie's exceptional execution, specifically lauded for its striking cinematography and hypnotic musical score. Brian Lowry from CNN refers to \\"First Man\\" as \\"a dazzling accomplishment\\" and includes it in his list of the year's best movies. He specifically notes that Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is quite the challenge due to the astronaut's naturally reserved personality. Still, Gosling's subtle touches - well-timed glances and expressions - adds depth to the character. Lowry highlights how Chazelle has successfully kept the story focused primarily on his protagonist and the space mission, contributing to the overall gripping experience of the movie. Nevertheless, not all critics align with Lowry's views. Stephanie Zacharek from Time accuses the film of being overdone, feeling that it carries an excess of emotion that does not fit well with the unassuming hero portrayed by Gosling. Furthermore, she criticizes Chazelle's decision to stress the impact of the 1968 death of Armstrong's 2-year-old daughter from a brain tumor as it deviates from the astronaut's private nature. Contrarily, Colin Covert from the Minneapolis Star Tribune appreciates the intimate insight into Armstrong's personal life that the film offers, helped in large part by Gosling’s moving performance. The actor, according to Covert, has managed to \\"dig down to the man's bone marrow,\\" a testament to his ability to portray the intricate facets of Armstrong's character. Covert also praises Claire Foy for her convincing and excellent portrayal of Armstrong's wife, Janet. Together, Covert believes Gosling and Foy bring a notable emotional intimacy to the story that adds a human touch to the vast, obscure backdrop of the space program. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star discusses the depth Gosling brought to the character along with the commendable performance by Foy. He describes a scene in particular where she demands her husband be the one to tell his two sons that he might not return from the mission as \\"a real 'Oscar moment.'\\" He goes on to add that though Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is impressive, it is Foy's emphatic portrayal of Janet that forms the real heart of the film. The movie achieves new heights with its depiction of the lunar landing, a sequence lauded by critics as one of the film's standout scenes. All in all, positively received by critics for its meticulous filmmaking and exceptional acting performances, \\"First Man\\" delivers an intense, intimate look into the life of a highly private hero, Neil Armstrong."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: I stood outside New York's Madison Square Garden and just stared, almost speechless. I was a farm boy from County Kilkenny, a child who some thought would never walk, let alone go as far as I had in the world. From the day I was born, there was a problem. The doctors at the Dublin hospital told my parents I had phocomelia, a _ that affected both legs below the knee, which were outward and shorter than normal and each foot had just three toes. Life was tough. I couldn't stand, much less walk. I rarely, left the farmhouse---and then only in someone's arms. Mam bundled me up whenever she took me to town, no matter the season. \\"The world will see him when he can walk,\\" she told Dad. \\"And he will walk.\\" Mam devoted herself to helping me. She tried everything to get me on my feet. When I was three, she and Dad took me to a clinic in Dublin. A few weeks later we returned to Dublin with my artificial limbs . Back home I practiced walking with my new limbs. \\"There's nothing anyone can do but you can't,\\" Mam said. \\"You and I are going to walk through town.\\" The next day Mam dressed me in my finest clothes. She wore a summer dress and fixed her hair and makeup. Dad drove us to the church. We stepped out of the car. Mam took my hand. \\"Hold your head up high, now, Ronan,\\" she said. We walked 300 meters to the post office. It was the farthest I'd walked, and I was sweating from the effort. Then we left the post office and continued down the street, Mam's eyes shining with a mother's pride. That night, back on our farm, I lay exhausted on my bed. It meant nothing, though, compared to what I'd done on my walk. Then I began to pursue my dream of singing. And at every step Mam's words came back to me--Ronan, you can do anything anyone else can do--and the faith she had in God, who would help me do it. I've sung from the grandest stages in Europe, to music played by the world's finest musicians. That night, I stood at the Madison Square Garden, with Mam's words chiming in my ears.

I found the following answer on Google: The different isotopes of carbon do not differ appreciably in their chemical properties. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Carbon-14 dating, also known as radiocarbon dating, is a method used by scientists to determine the age of an object containing organic material by measuring the levels of carbon-14 within it. The answer you found on Google pertains to the chemical properties of different isotopes of carbon, while it may be related, it does not directly answer the question of what Carbon-14 dating is. To provide a more detailed explanation, the isotope carbon-14 is a rare and unstable form of carbon that has six protons and eight neutrons in its nucleus. It is produced in trace amounts in the Earth's atmosphere when cosmic rays interact with nitrogen-14 atoms, leading to the creation of carbon-14. This isotope, along with the other isotopes of carbon, forms the basis of our understanding of carbon-based life and is used in Carbon-14 dating methods. Once formed, carbon-14 combines with atmospheric oxygen to create radioactive carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide is taken in by plants during photosynthesis and is eventually consumed by animals. This integration of carbon-14 means that the distribution of the isotope remains relatively consistent throughout the food chain, resulting in all living organisms containing a small, measurable amount of the substance. As a radioactive isotope, carbon-14 undergoes a process called radioactive decay, which sees it slowly change back into nitrogen-14 over time. The rate at which this change occurs is predictable and consistent, with a known \\"half-life\\" of 5,730 years. In radiocarbon dating, scientists take advantage of this consistent decay rate to determine the age of organic material such as fossils, bones, and even ancient artifacts made of wood or fabric. When an organism dies, its exchange of carbon-14 with the environment ceases, and the remaining carbon-14 inside begins to decay at that rate. By accurately measuring the remaining amount of carbon-14 in the sample and comparing it to the expected levels in a living organism, scientists can calculate how long it has been since the organism died, or the artifact was created. In summary, the statement you found about isotopes of carbon not differing appreciably in their chemical properties is correct. However, the answer does not explicitly address the concept of Carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 dating is a method used to determine the age of organic materials by measuring the amount of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 within them and comparing it to the expected levels in living organisms, allowing for the calculation of the time elapsed since the organism's death or the artifact's creation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the given equation: 309*y + 6 = 306*y 2. Rearrange the equation to get all terms containing y on one side of the equation: Subtract 306*y from both sides of the equation to isolate the y terms on the left side: (309*y - 306*y) + 6 = 0 3. Simplify the left side of the equation by combining the like terms: 3*y + 6 = 0 4. Now, isolate the y term in the equation by moving the constant term to the right side of the equation: Subtract 6 from both sides: 3*y = -6 5. Finally, solve for y by dividing by the coefficient of y (3): y = -6 / 3 6.

The kid was terrible, talking to himself (although I suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all), doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump, threatening a raccoon, munching on worms, and (what a dumbass) kicking a porcupine. And he wouldn't be pulling those quills out that easily either...they stick like fishhooks. At least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times. What was up with the flashback thing? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce. What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something. At least that would have been more exciting.

The movie gets a rating of 2 out of 10 due to the scenery, otherwise, it would have been rated even lower. 4.

Wilhelm was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (nee Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. Though Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen. Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April 18, 1952 at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he never hit another home run. Pitching exclusively in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished in the top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7-8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954. In 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship. He pitched 111 innings, finishing with a 12-4 record and a 2.10 ERA. During one of Wilhelm's appearances that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice. When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the home runs. The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career postseason play. He pitched 2 1/3 innings over two games, earning a save in the third game. The team won the World Series in a four-game sweep. Wilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4-1 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4-9 record and a 3.83 ERA in 89 1/3 innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \\"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did Wilhelm first start playing baseball?","completion":"Wilhelm first started playing baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I was ten, my mother worked all day so I had to take care of my younger brother. At that time my little brother was about four years old and he missed mum all the time. One day, after I had given him his dinner, he started crying for mum. He was so young and really needed mum. So I dressed him, put on his shoes, carried him on my back and walked out. Soon he fell asleep. About half an hour late, I found that he had lost a shoe while sleeping. I took him off my back and put him down. I knew we needed to find that shoe, for our mother couldn\`t afford new shoes. We had to go back to find it, so I told my brother to Wait right here. A man heard it and stopped me just before I walked off. He asked me, \\"You are leaving your brother here to find the shoe? What would you do if he is not here when you return?\\" I did not know how to answer that question. He continued,: It is OK if you can\`t find the shoe, but it is not OK to lose your brother.\\" Then he sent us to mum\`s workplace by taxi.

His decision follows a leadership overhaul by the National Coalition. Ahmed Jarba was named leader of the main opposition alliance on Saturday as Saudi-backed candidates defeated those allied with Qatar in several elections. On Monday, Mr Jarba warned that there was a \\"real humanitarian disaster\\" in the central city of Homs and said he was prepared to offer President Bashar al-Assad a truce during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan to stop the fighting there. As government forces continued an offensive on opposition-held districts of Homs, state media said the army had killed \\"terrorists\\" in several areas, including Bab Houd in the Old City and several outlying towns. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Bab Houd and al-Safsafa had been hit by heavy artillery and tank fire on Monday. The UK-based activist group said troops had also captured about a fifth of the besieged northern district of Khalidiya. A government official had earlier claimed that the entire district was under army control. A car bomb also exploded in the predominantly Alawite and Christian area of Akrama, killing at least four people, officials and activists said. Profile: Ahmad Jarba The violence in Homs and elsewhere in Syria has left civilians in rebel-held areas in dire need of humanitarian assistance, opposition and humanitarian activists say. In March, Mr Hitto was tasked by the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces with forming an interim government to administer so-called \\"liberated\\" zones, co-ordinating the provision basic services and supplies. However, Mr Hitto was mistrusted by many members of the opposition alliance, who saw him as too close to the Muslim Brotherhood and Qatar, and he has been effectively side-lined since. The National Coalition's former president, Moaz al-Khatib, believed the creation of an interim government was premature and announced his resignation five days after Mr Hitto's appointment. On Monday, Mr Hitto said he was standing down as prime minister after being unable to form an administration. \\"I emphasise I will continue working for the interests of the revolution and towards achieving its objectives,\\" he added. Mr Jarba, an influential tribal figure with close links to Saudi Arabia, meanwhile said he expected advanced weapons supplied by Saudi Arabia to reach rebel fighters \\"soon\\" and that they would change the military balance in Syria. He also said the National Coalition would not attend peace talks in Geneva planned by the US and Russia unless its military position improved. \\"If we are going to go to Geneva, we have to be strong on the ground, unlike the situation now, which is weak,\\" he told the Reuters news agency. In a separate development on Monday, Syria's ruling Baath Party announced that it had elected a new regional command, replacing its ageing leadership, including Vice-President Farouq al-Sharaa. State TV said the 16 members of the top decision-making body were chosen during a meeting of the party's central committee. \\"The Baath Party must develop to strengthen a culture of dialogue... and deepen interaction with citizens to overcome the negative effect of the crisis,\\" President Assad was quoted as saying. Among the new members of the regional command are parliamentary speaker Jihad al-Laham and Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi. During nearly five decades in power in Syria, the Baath Party has evolved from an Arab nationalist movement into a vast organisation that has infiltrated every aspect of public life. Although a large number of low-ranking officials have publicly left the party since the start of the uprising in March 2011, its main leadership bodies have remained steadfastly loyal to Mr Assad. Summary:","completion":"A man named Ghassan Hitto said he will stop being the prime minister of a group of people who don't like the leader of their country, President Bashar al-Assad.

One believes she was raped by the villagers years before, and is blind. Another is afraid of sunlight. They all react violently to crucifixes. The sisters are being manipulated by a sinister old man who alternates between admonishing them to kill newcomers that threaten their exposure, and groping their breasts. The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions.

Below are some of the alternatives: 1. Delayed Birth Certificate: If the birth certificate was not filed within one year of the applicant's birth, the delayed birth certificate can be used as an alternative. This document is issued by the state or local government, and it includes the applicant's birth information, parents' names, and supporting documents that verify the date and place of birth. 2. Letter of No Record: This letter is issued by the state of birth and confirms that there is no birth certificate on file for the applicant. This document must be accompanied by early public records to prove citizenship. 3. Early Public Records: If the applicant cannot provide a birth certificate, they can submit a combination of early public records. These records must show the applicant's name, place of birth, and preferably the date of birth. Examples of early public records include a baptismal certificate, hospital birth record, census record, early school record, or a family Bible record. These documents must be issued within the first five years of the applicant's life. 4. Form DS-10: Birth Affidavit: The applicant may choose to submit a birth affidavit (Form DS-10) completed by someone with personal knowledge of the applicant's birth. This person must be older than the applicant and must have known the applicant since their birth. The birth affidavit should be notarized and submitted in addition to early public records. 5. Certificate of Citizenship: If the applicant is a naturalized citizen, they can submit their Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-560 or N-561) as an alternative to the birth certificate. 6. Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA): If the applicant was born outside the United States to a U.S. citizen parent(s), they can provide a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (Form FS-240, DS-1350, or FS-545) issued by a U.S. Embassy or Consulate as proof of citizenship.

The group was formed in 1981 by the Abbott brothers - drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell - along with lead vocalist Terry Glaze. Bassist Rex Brown joined the band the following year, replacing Tommy D. Bradford, who was the unofficial original. Shortly after Power Metal was released, \\"Diamond Darrell\\", as he was then known, auditioned for Megadeth's vacant guitarist slot, and was invited to join the band. Darrell insisted his brother, bandmate Vinnie Paul, be included, but because Chuck Behler was still in the band at the time, Darrell declined and Dave Mustaine instead decided on Marty Friedman. The Abbott brothers refocused their attention on Pantera, and in 1989 they were given their first shot at commercial success. 1989 was also when the band formed their relationship with Walter O'Brien at Concrete Management (the management arm of Concrete Marketing), who remained their manager until they disbanded in 2003. After being turned down \\"28 times by every major label on the face of the Earth\\", Atco Records representatives Mark Ross and Stevenson Eugenio were asked by their boss Derek Shulman, who was interested in signing Pantera, to see the band perform after Hurricane Hugo stranded them in Texas. Ross was so impressed by the band's performance that he called his boss that night, suggesting that Pantera be signed to the label. Atco Records accepted, and at the close of 1989, the band recorded its major label debut at Pantego Studios. Released on July 24, 1990, and produced by Terry Date and Pantera, Cowboys from Hell was another leap into heavier territory. Pantera showed a more extreme style on this outing, leaving behind its glam metal influences in favor of mid-tempo thrash metal dubbed \\"power groove\\" (groove metal) by the band. Although Anselmo still used Rob Halford-influenced vocals, he also adopted a more abrasive delivery. Darrell's more complex guitar solos and riffs, along with his brother's faster-paced drumwork were evidence of the band's extreme transformation. The album marked a critical juncture in the band's history. Many fans, as well as the band itself, consider it Pantera's \\"official\\" debut. Cowboys included the tracks \\"Cemetery Gates\\", a brooding seven-minute piece that focuses on death and religion, and the thrashing title track, which gave the band members their nickname and asserted their raucous personality and style. So began the Cowboys from Hell tour alongside thrash acts Exodus and Suicidal Tendencies. In 1991, Rob Halford performed with the band onstage, which led Pantera (along with Annihilator) to open for Judas Priest on its first show in Europe. They also opened for bands like Fates Warning, Prong, Mind over Four and Morbid Angel, and co-headlined a North American tour with Wrathchild America. The band eventually landed a billing for \\"Monsters in Moscow\\" with AC/DC and Metallica in September 1991, where they played to a crowd of over 500,000 in celebration of the new freedom of performing Western music in the Soviet Union shortly before its collapse three months later. The band was often found at the Dallas club \\"the Basement\\", where the band shot the videos for \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" and \\"Psycho Holiday\\". Pantera's 2006 home video compilation 3 Vulgar Videos from Hell features performances of \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\", \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", \\"Domination\\", and \\"Psycho Holiday\\" from the show in Moscow.

Given the background: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. and the situation: David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city. Answer the following question: Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B? Answer:","completion":"Group B would be less likely to engage in visually intensive works. Since group A consists of individuals with myopia, they may already be involved in activities that require close visual work, which is a contributing factor to nearsightedness, as mentioned in the background information. Group B, on the other hand, does not have myopia and is therefore less likely to be engaged in visually intensive work. However, it is important for David to devise a plan to tackle myopia in the entire population, considering both genetic and environmental factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Define the term \\"head\\" A \\"head\\" is the uppermost part of a being's body, where the brain, eyes, mouth, and nose are situated. In this context, it is clear that the term \\"head\\" refers to a body part. Step 3: Evaluate the given options Now, we need to determine which of the options provided best corresponds to the correct attachment for a head. - Submarine: A submarine is an underwater vehicle, and a head is not relevant to it. - Human body: A human body is an appropriate option as a head is a part of it. - Ship: A ship is a large watercraft, and again, a head is not related to it. - Neck: A neck is actually the part that connects the head to the rest of the human body. However, the question asks what the head attaches to, which needs a broader context than just the neck. - Morgue: A morgue is a facility where dead bodies are stored, and it is not directly related to the attachment of a head. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate option Based on the evaluation in step 3, the most appropriate option is the \\"human body\\" because it is the broader context and the most accurate answer.

Summarize this article: They said thousands of Britons had been unable to bring a non-EU spouse to the UK since July 2012, when minimum earnings requirements were introduced. Children have also been separated from a parent, the parliamentary group said. The Home Office said the rules were designed to ease the burden of migration on the taxpayer. Under rules that came into force a year ago only British citizens who can show they earn at least £18,600 a year can sponsor their non-European spouse's visa. This rises to £22,400 for families with a child, and a further £2,400 for each further child. The inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration, which is calling for an independent review of the minimum income requirement, looked at more than 175 cases from families affected by the rules. Forty-five claimed their inability to meet the income threshold had led to the separation of children, including British children, from a non-EU parent, the group said. In one case, a woman from outside Europe had been separated from her British husband and two sons, including a five-month-old baby she had been breastfeeding. Douglas Shillinglaw, from Kent, is among those to have been affected. His wife is in Lagos, Nigeria, with his five-month old son and her six-year-old son from another relationship. Mr Shillinglaw, a self-employed mortgage broker for two years, told the BBC he was being \\"judged like an employed person\\". \\"Self-employed income is different from employed income. I have got enough money to pay my mortgage and bills, and that should be enough,\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"And should anything happen to me, I have a family that will take care of them. My family are wholeheartedly behind what I am doing.\\" Mark Reckless, Conservative MP on the home affairs select committee, said the government had promised to bring down net immigration and it had done so by \\"bearing down\\" on bogus colleges, caps on work visas and reforms on family immigration. \\"If you are bringing someone into the country, then you should be expected to support that person without recourse to public expense,\\" he told Today. \\"Over time, it might be possible that the regulations could be adjusted. There will be hard cases and we learn in light of those experiences.\\" The group also heard from a number of UK sponsors in full-time employment at or above the national minimum wage who reported that they were unable to meet the income requirement. Wider evidence suggested that 47% of the UK working population last year would have failed to meet the income level to sponsor a non-European Economic Area partner, the group said. By the government's own estimate, almost 18,000 British people will be prevented from being reunited with their spouse or partner in the UK every year as a result of the new rules, it added. Baroness Hamwee, chairwoman of the inquiry and Liberal Democrat home affairs lead in the House of Lords, said the parliamentary group had been \\"struck by the evidence showing just how many British people have been kept apart from partners, children and elderly relatives\\". \\"These rules are causing anguish for families and, counter to their original objectives, may actually be costing the public purse,\\" she said. Liberal Democrat group member Sarah Teather MP said that \\"whatever the objective of the policy, children shouldn't suffer as a result\\". A Home Office spokesman said the rules had been designed to make sure those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner would not become a burden on the taxpayer and would be well enough supported to integrate effectively. \\"High-value migrants would not be refused because their British spouse or partner was not employed,\\" he said. \\"They can meet the income threshold by having cash savings of £62,500 or through their own private income, for example from investments. We have also introduced greater flexibility for those holding investments to liquidate them into cash in order to meet the rules.\\"","completion":"This article is about a rule in the UK that says a British person must earn a certain amount of money before their husband or wife from another country can move to the UK.

But a group of people from different political parties is worried that this rule is causing problems for many families, including separating children from one of their parents.

Updated Motorola CPUs made a faster machine possible, and in 1987 Apple took advantage of the new Motorola technology and introduced the Macintosh II at 5500, powered by a 16 MHz Motorola 68020 processor. The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine. Among the many innovations in Color QuickDraw were the ability to handle any display size, any color depth, and multiple monitors. The Macintosh II marked the start of a new direction for the Macintosh, as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several NuBus expansion slots, support for color graphics and external monitors, and a modular design similar to that of the IBM PC. It had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan, which was initially fairly loud. One third-party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor, but it voided the warranty. Later Macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What marked the end of a new direction for Macintosh","completion":"The question seems to be looking for an event that marked the end of a new direction for Macintosh. However, it's important to note that the Macintosh II marked the *start* of a new direction for the Macintosh, not the end. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to ask for an event that marked the end of a new direction based on the given information.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Does Earth have more or less greenhouse gases than Caprica? Space explorers, that launched from Earth, just encountered a new planet several light years away. This planet is almost an exact copy of Earth, but it is currently uninhabited by intelligent life. Upon landing, the explorers name the planet Caprica and begin learning as much as they can. They discover that the species on this Caprica are nearly all the same as on Earth, and even most of the topography looks the same. However, the main difference is that humans never evolved here. For this reason, there are no cities or cars or factories to burn up fossil fuels. Hint: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Earth has more greenhouse gases than Caprica. The main reason for this is the presence of human activities on Earth, such as the burning of fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In contrast, Caprica does not have human activity, cities, cars, or factories to burn fossil fuels. As a result, there is less carbon dioxide being released into Caprica's atmosphere, leading to fewer greenhouse gases in comparison to Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Instructions: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: By Judith BurnsEducation reporter Victims' grades and mental health too often suffer and some quit altogether, according to an Equality and Human Rights Commission report. But too many universities fear facing up to the issue will harm their reputation, the authors say. In response, Universities UK pledged \\"urgent steps\\" on racial harassment. The EHRC carried out in-depth interviews with students and staff, commissioned a survey of a representative sample of more than 1,000 students and sent a questionnaire to universities. The report says about 13% of the students questioned had experienced racial harassment, rising to about a quarter of students from minority ethnic backgrounds, but universities are often unaware of the true extent of the problem on their campuses. It calls the results \\"damning\\". 'Pretty for a black girl' Students and staff had experienced: One undergraduate in Wales, reported aggression from fellow students. \\"On multiple occasions, myself or my friends have had the N-word shouted at us or being told they are 'pretty for a black girl',\\" she said. While black and Asian students were most likely to report abuse, Jewish and Muslim students also said they were targeted. A Jewish student said he had been threatened with being put in an oven, amid references to Auschwitz, during a protest event on campus. Muslim students spoke of feeling the need to play down their religious identity because of security checks at university events. International students said they often felt unwelcome, isolated and vulnerable, treated like commodities only wanted by universities for their fees. And many students reported \\"microaggressions\\" from staff or fellow students who, for example, expressed surprise they were on a particular course or mixed them up with the only other person of their ethnicity on the course. Students who complained about racial \\"banter\\" said they were often accused of being \\"oversensitive\\" and felt they received little empathy or understanding. \\"It impacted my academic performance because I didn't enjoy studying or doing group work with students who were so casually racist, sexist and homophobic,\\" said one. 'Isolated and alone' Others said their mental health had been affected \\"I just don't want to be brown anymore. I wish I could boil my skin off or bleach it entirely,\\" said an international student at university in England And an academic at a Welsh university said: \\"As a Muslim, suicide is never an option but I feel incredibly isolated and alone. This institution is the first time in my life I have felt the target of racism.\\" The EHRC found a large discrepancy between the proportion of students reporting racial incidents during its research and the number recorded by universities. Students are often reluctant to complain at all and many informal complaints are unrecorded, so some universities do not have a true sense of the scale of racial harassment on their campuses, the report says. About one in five universities said they had received no complaints of racial harassment at all in more than three years. The report suggests some are reluctant to admit the true scale of the problem for fear of putting off potential students and losing their fees. \\"They are living in the past and have failed to learn from history,\\" said EHRC chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath, \\"No-one should ever be subjected to racial harassment in any setting. \\"Our report reveals that not only are universities out of touch with the extent that this is occurring on their campuses, some are also completely oblivious to the issue.\\" Universities UK president and Brunel University vice-chancellor Prof Julia Buckingham said the EHRC's findings were \\"sad and shocking\\", calling on her fellow university leaders to make tackling racial harassment a top priority. Earlier this month UUK called on universities to give more attention to harassment and hate crimes related to race or faith. The body says it will now call on universities to commit publicly to making it easier for people to report incidents and to putting better processes in place to respond more effectively.

Translate to English","completion":"The sentence you provided is in Turkish and translates to \\"The remaining NATO personnel are now serving in the Department of Defense\\" in English. Here's a bit more context to expand on this situation. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an international alliance that consists of 30 member countries from North America and Europe. Its main purpose is to safeguard the freedom and security of its member countries through diplomatic and military means. When the sentence refers to 'the remaining NATO personnel', it suggests that there has been a shift of some sort in the distribution or numbers of this staff. There could be many reasons for such a shift, like a movement of resources to areas where they are needed more, following a strategic plan, or in response to current world events. When it mentions that these remaining personnel are now 'serving in the Department of Defense', it implies that they are working in a government department responsible for implementing defense policies and overseeing all matters relating to national security and the armed forces. In the United States, for example, this is a high-level government agency from which the Secretary of Defense leads and directs the country's military components. As to what specifically their duties within the Department of Defense might be, it can vary widely.

How to choose foods to improve digestion Eat more fiber. One of the best ingredients in food that will help with digestion is fiber. If you are running from a low level of fiber, start slowly. Options are: A). Start by increasing your daily intake of fiber by about 10% every week until you hit the recommended goal. This is 25 to 38 grams (0.88 to 1.3 oz) of fiber a day, depending on your age and gender. B). Eat some of the following food groups every day to lower the intake of fiber, slowly increasing the amount or frequency of fiber: fruits, vegetables, grains, oats, nuts, or (sometimes) a combination of foods. Beans, brown rice, beans, soybeans, and wheat are all great source of fiber, particularly compared to refined grains. C). Then you can work up to adding up how much fiber you are consuming as a small percentage of that fiber can be absorbed in food. Try eating low fiber versions of whole grains, leafy vegetables, or fresh fruit. D). You'll find that the lower-carb and sugar content of fruits and vegetables, the longer they last. The average amount of fiber is measured in milligrams/grams.","completion":"Next, we need to compare the options provided and decide which one is the most suitable for continuing the paragraph. In this case, we can eliminate option C because it talks about reducing fiber intake, which contradicts the goal of improving digestion. Option D is also not relevant, as it focuses on the longevity of fruits and vegetables rather than their impact on digestion. Therefore, the most fitting option to continue the paragraph is a mix of options A and B, which both emphasize increasing fiber intake to improve digestion: To gradually increase your fiber intake, start by increasing your daily intake of fiber by about 10% every week until you hit the recommended goal. This is 25 to 38 grams (0.88 to 1.3 oz) of fiber a day, depending on your age and gender. Additionally, eat some of the following food groups every day to lower the intake of fiber, slowly increasing the amount or frequency of fiber: fruits, vegetables, grains, oats, nuts, or (sometimes) a combination of foods.

Movie plot title: The Strangers Movie plot: James (Scott Speedman) and his girlfriend Kristen (Liv Tyler) arrive at James' childhood summer home, tired and irritable after a long evening at a friend's wedding reception. It is revealed that while they were there, James proposed to Kristen and she refused, claiming she is not ready for marriage yet. James calls his friend Mike to come pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a knock at the door, surprising to them both since the house is so remote and far from any civilisation for miles. They open the door and a young blonde woman, whose face is obscured by low lighting, is standing on the porch asking for Tamara. When told that she is at the wrong house, she asks if they're sure, then leaves with the casual caveat that she will \\"see them later\\". Due to the tension between him and Kristen, James leaves to go for a drive and to buy cigarettes. While alone in the house, Kristen hears another knock at the door; she refuses to open it after realising that it is the same woman from earlier, who has returned to ask for Tamara again. She leaves. Kristen then starts hearing strange noises around the outside of the house and her cell phone goes missing. She calls James using the house phone but the line goes dead. The smoke alarm goes off and Kristen disarms it as there is another loud bang on the front door. She goes to the kitchen and grabs a large knife. When she returns, the smoke alarm cover has been placed on one of the chairs, so Kristen knows somebody has been inside. When she hears a noise from the back yard, she goes to the back door and opens the curtains to find a man wearing a sack mask staring back at her. Panicked, she hides in the bedroom until James returns. When James arrives back, she explains what has happened and he goes to investigate.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. When does the author advise that adding super foods should occur after beginning clean eating? Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them B. not enough information C. when one is able to acquire produce in bulk D. after reading \\"experts\\" advice on clean eating Answer:","completion":"A. one does not have to eat \\"super foods\\" at any time since clean eating is possible without them"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you have asked are different from one another. The first question pertains to a personal relationship and navigating a change in that relationship, while the second question concerns time management for a student with a busy schedule. I will provide detailed answers for both questions separately. Question 1: I contacted my ex-gf after 30 days of no contact, she's asking me to be her brother? What it means? When your ex-girlfriend is asking you to be her brother, she likely means that she wants to redefine your relationship in a more platonic sense. It suggests that she values the connection you two share, but she is not interested in maintaining a romantic or intimate relationship with you. Instead, she might be seeking a deep emotional bond that resembles a familial relationship, where you can support and care for each other without the expectations and pressures that come with a romantic partnership. This proposition can be difficult to navigate, especially if you still have romantic feelings for her. It is essential to consider your feelings, boundaries, and what you are comfortable with before agreeing to this new dynamic. While it may be possible to cultivate a healthy and supportive friendship, it is also possible that transitioning to a sibling-like bond might lead to confusion, discomfort, or unresolved feelings. Ultimately, you should have an open and honest conversation with your ex-girlfriend about this request and carefully weigh the pros and cons. Make sure to prioritize your well-being and consider whether this new relationship dynamic will benefit or harm your emotional state and growth. Question 2: I'm in std.11 and I'm unable to manage time. School timing is from 7:30-2:30. And my tuition timing is from 6:30-9:30 how can I manage time? Time management is crucial for students, especially when juggling a demanding schedule. Here are some steps you can follow to better manage your time: 1. Plan your day: Use a planner, calendar, or digital app to schedule your daily activities, including study time, tuition, and recreational activities. Prioritize essential tasks and allocate a specific time for each activity. 2. Set goals: Break down your ultimate goals, such as academic achievements, into smaller, manageable tasks. Prioritize and assign deadlines to these tasks, which can help track your progress and motivate you to stay on schedule. 3. Make use of travel time: If you spend time commuting to school or tuition, utilize that duration for light studying, reviewing notes, or planning your day. 4. Allocate time for breaks: Avoid burnout by assigning sufficient time for breaks, where you can relax, recharge, and engage in hobbies or social activities. 5. Utilize weekends effectively: Plan your weekends to complete pending tasks and engage in recreational activities, ensuring a balance between work and relaxation. 6. Stay organized: Organize your study materials and workspace to minimize distractions and improve focus. Avoid procrastinating and tackle tasks one at a time to prevent overwhelming situations. 7. Time management techniques: Implement techniques such as Pomodoro (working in intervals with short breaks) or prioritizing tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important, Non-Urgent/Important, Urgent/Non-Important, Non-Urgent/Non-Important) to enhance productivity. 8. Self-discipline: Practice self-discipline by avoiding distractions, such as excessive use of social media or procrastination, and sticking to your daily schedule. With consistent effort, these strategies can help you effectively manage your time, ensuring a balance between academic obligations, extracurricular activities, and personal well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Pick from: A. negative; B. positive; TEXT:Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of.

Article: OCPD is also called anankastic personality disorder (depending on where you live in the world). As the name suggests, it is a personality disorder. A personality disorder is where there is ongoing maladaptive patterns of thinking, behaviours and experiences that transcend different contexts and significantly affect much of the person’s life. As such with OCPD, there is a preoccupation with the need for power and control over one’s own environment. These symptoms must involve a pervasive pattern of a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, interpersonal and psychological control. Such control must come at the expense of efficiency, openness and flexibility as there is a strong level of rigidity in one’s beliefs that often interferes with the ability to complete tasks. OCPD is a completely different diagnosis from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), although it shares some of the same symptoms. An obsession, as the name suggests, means the individual’s thoughts and feelings are completely dominated by a persistent idea. This, for example, could be cleanliness, security or many other things that have significant meaning to the individual. A compulsion involves performing an action repeatedly and persistently without leading to a reward or pleasure. These acts are often performed to make the obsessions go away, such as repeatedly washing one’s hands due to an obsession with cleanliness or repeatedly checking one’s door is locked 32 times due to an obsession that if this does not occur, someone may break in. Obsessive compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder involving intrusive obsessions that must be addressed through acting out on compulsive behaviours. People who suffer from OCD often recognize that their obsessions are illogical or irrational but feel like they cannot avoid them. People with OCPD, which is a personality disorder, often do not recognize their thoughts or pervasive need for inflexible control of all areas of their lives as irrational or problematic. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) states that in order to have the diagnosis of OCPD, the patient needs to have four or more of the following symptoms present in a variety of contexts that interferes with the individual's life: Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met) Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity) Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification) Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes Shows significant rigidity and stubbornness Similarly, the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Disease 10 specifies that the patient must satisfy the general diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder (as mentioned above) and have three of the following symptoms to be diagnosed with anankastic personality disorder: Feelings of excessive doubt and caution; Preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedule; Perfectionism that interferes with task completion; Excessive conscientiousness, scrupulousness, and undue preoccupation with productivity to the exclusion of pleasure and interpersonal relationships; Excessive pedantry and adherence to social conventions; Rigidity and stubbornness; Unreasonable insistence by the individual that others submit exactly to his or her way of doing things, or unreasonable reluctance to allow others to do things; Intrusion of insistent and unwelcome thoughts or impulses. OCPD is one of the most common personality disorders; the DSM-V estimates that between 2.1-7.9% of the general population suffer from OCPD. It also appears to run in families, so OCPD may have a genetic component. Men are about twice as likely to have OCPD as women. Children who grew up in controlling, rigid homes or environments may be more likely to develop OCPD. Children who grew up with parents who were too stern and disapproving or overly protective may be more likely to develop OCPD. 70% of people with OCPD also suffer from depression. About 25-50% of people with OCD also have OCPD. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), also known as anankastic personality disorder, which is a personality disorder characterized by ongoing maladaptive patterns of thinking, behaviors, and experiences. The main features of OCPD include a pervasive preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, often at the expense of efficiency, openness, and flexibility. OCPD is distinct from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) even though they share some similar symptoms. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) and the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Disease 10 provide specific diagnostic criteria for OCPD. The disorder is one of the most common personality disorders, affecting between 2.1-7.9% of the general population, with men being twice as likely to have OCPD as women. It may have a genetic component and can be associated with certain childhood environments.

No remorse: Maksim Gelman listens to relatives of his victims during his sentencing at Supreme Court in New York, Wednesday. A 24-year-old man who pleaded guilty to murder and other crimes in a violent stabbing rampage in New York City last winter was sentenced today to 200 years in prison during a hearing in which he hurled epithets at one of his victims and was told by the judge that he was a 'sociopath'. Maksim Gelman, born in Ukraine, pleaded guilty in November in Brooklyn to murder and other charges in the spree in February 2011, which included stabbing his stepfather and two others to death, fatally running down a pedestrian, stealing a car and attacking a subway passenger. Today, he was sentenced to the maximum sentence for each of 13 counts; some of the sentences will run consecutively, resulting in the 200-year term. 'You are a violent predator and sociopath,' Judge Vincent Del Giudice said. Gelman's deadly spree on February 11 started with a family argument over whether he could use his mother's car. He. stabbed his stepfather to death in their Brooklyn home, then took off. in the car and drove to the home of an acquaintance, Yelena Bulchenko. Bulchenko's friends have said he was obsessed with the 20-year-old woman. and imagined a romantic relationship with her. She wasn't home, but Gelman stabbed. her 56-year-old mother to death, then waited nearly nine hours with the. body for the daughter to return. When she walked in, he stabbed her 11. times, killing her, authorities said. On Wednesday, Gelman interrupted. Bulchenko's boyfriend, Gerard Honig, telling him he had fallen in love. 'with a heroin addict,' to which Honig responded, 'You can burn in. hell.' Gelman was then removed from the courtroom for a short time. Maxiumum sentence: Some of Gelman's sentences will run consecutively, resulting in in the 200-year term for each of the 13 counts. Tense: Gelman during the sentencing interrupted the boyfriend of one of his victims, telling him he had fallen in love 'with a heroin addict,' to which the man responded, 'You can burn in hell' After stabbing Bulchenko, Gelman left the home, rear-ended a car and wildly stabbed at the driver, authorities said. The driver survived. Stealing the wounded man's car, Gelman drove off and ploughed into 62-year-old Stephen Tanenbaum, who died from his injuries. After abandoning the car, he later hailed a livery cab and attacked its driver, then approached another car, attacked a man inside and seized the car, police said. Both men survived. All those attacks happened in. Brooklyn. As authorities hunted him, Gelman was next spotted hours later. on a subway train in Manhattan, where passengers recognised him from. newspaper photographs and notified police. Tragic: Gelman is accused of driving to 20-year-old Yelena Bulchenko's home on East 24th Street and stabbing her. Gruesome: Yelena and her mother, 56-year-old Anna, were killed at the same Brooklyn address. Victim: Gelman is accused of repeatedly stabbing Joseph Lozito, 40, on the subway, before he was arrested in February. He dashed across the tracks, switched. trains and attacked a final passenger before he was grabbed by police. who were in the subway car looking for him on the tracks. The livery driver, Fitz Fullerton, spoke at the Wednesday hearing in a whisper because his voice box was damaged by Gelman.'I just got caught up in this, this is my like third time ever seeing him and I hope he gets what he deserves,' Fullerton said. Gelman also made a brief statement, saying 'I'm not the bad guy here,' and that it wasn't his fault. He also said he was being followed by federal agents in an undercover investigation. Gelman had previously said he wasn't guilty, was under medical supervision and his attorney, Edward Friedman, described his client's mental state as fragile. Arrest: Gelman is led away from the subway after stabbing an innocent passenger on the train on February 13. Spree's over: Gelman, of Brooklyn, is put into a car by officers outside the 61st Precinct. But given the evidence and a psychiatrist's recent opinion that Gelman couldn't argue he was not guilty by reason of insanity, he decided he wanted to get out of his holding cell and start serving his time in a permanent facility, his lawyer said. No plea deal was offered. On Tuesday, Gelman admitted trying to kill passenger Joseph Lozito on a train on February 12 at the end of his two-day spree. Police later recovered a bloody knife, three straight razor blades, a paring knife and 932. When asked by police why the four victims had to die, Gelman said, 'Because I said so,' according to the documents. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Millions more take part in the activity around the world. Some do it just for fun. Others compete. Climbing takes strength, control and good balance. Climbers have to pull themselves straight up the face of very high rocks or walls. So they have to be strong enough to carry their own weight. And climbers sometimes have to hold onto rocks by only their fingers or toes. There are several kinds of rock climbing. Traditional rock climbing is done outside. Climbers wear ropes and tie equipment to the rocks as they climb many hundreds of meters up. They also connect their ropes to the equipment. If a climber slips, a rope can stop him from falling. Sport climbing is similar. However, in it the protective equipment is placed in the rock all the time. There is also indoor climbing. Rock walls made of wood have places for the climber's hands and feet. Ice climbing is exactly as it sounds. People climb glaciers or frozen waterfalls instead of rocks. They use special equipment for the ice. And then there is bouldering-climbing rocks between three and seven meters high. It is quicker and stronger climbing. Many climbers like bouldering because they can use less equipment. Climbers often need only special shoes and chalk . All climbers use chalk to keep their hands dry. Most rocks have cracks and holes and parts that stick out. Climbers use these for foot-holds and handholds. Climbers use their legs to climb. They try not to pull themselves up with their hands or arms. Arms and hands are for position and balance. People almost always climb in groups of two or more. Climbing alone is very dangerous.

Higher oil prices and rising interest rates are likely to lead to a slowdown in spending on the UK High Street, business leaders predict.","completion":"This analysis is concerning the potential impact of higher oil prices and rising interest rates on consumer spending, particularly in the United Kingdom's High Streets. The UK High Street refers to the primary shopping areas in cities and towns. These areas typically consist of retail stores, leisure and dining establishments, and other consumer businesses. Business leaders are voicing their concerns that the combination of these two factors could lead to a slowdown in spending, which would, in turn, have broader implications for the UK economy. Higher oil prices often lead to increased costs of production and transportation, which subsequently affects consumer prices. When oil prices rise, businesses may have to adjust their expenses accordingly, passing those increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods and services. This could lead to a decline in consumer demand as the price of everyday items increase, making it more difficult for individuals to maintain their current spending levels. Rising interest rates also have a direct effect on consumer spending. When interest rates increase, it typically leads to higher borrowing costs for both businesses and consumers. This can make it more difficult for businesses to invest in expansion or maintain their operations, as the costs of borrowing capital become excessive. It can also make it more challenging for consumers to finance their purchases, such as homes, vehicles, and other largeticket items, which may result in reduced spending on smaller, discretionary items as well. The combination of these two factors can have a ripple effect across the entire economy. If consumer spending decreases because of higher prices and reduced borrowing capabilities, businesses may be forced to lay off employees or cut back on their operations, which may contribute to higher unemployment levels, further reducing the UK's economic health. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on predictions from business leaders and not guaranteed outcomes. Governments and central banks can implement monetary and fiscal policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of these factors on the economy. For example, central banks could decide to lower interest rates in response to declining spending or introduce targeted stimulus measures to support industries heavily impacted by higher oil prices. Additionally, businesses can seek out alternative means of production to lower their reliance on oil or find ways to streamline their supply chains, reducing their exposure to fluctuations in oil prices. In conclusion, higher oil prices and rising interest rates could lead to a slowdown in spending on the UK High Street, as predicted by business leaders. These factors could increase costs for businesses and consumers alike, making it more challenging for both to maintain their current spending patterns. However, there are numerous strategies, both for governments and companies, to mitigate the impact of these external influences. The actual extent of the slowdown and its consequences on the UK economy will depend on a variety of factors, including how businesses and policy-makers navigate through these challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Translate to German: I voted in favour of this report.","completion":"Ich habe für diesen Bericht gestimmt. To provide some bit of context and to make this answer a bit longer, let me break down the translation. 'I' is translated in German as 'Ich'. It's the personal pronoun pertaining to the first person singular. 'Voted' is the past tense form of 'to vote' and it translates to 'habe gestimmt'. Here we see a common structure in forming the past tense in German, known as Perfekt. It uses an auxiliary verb - in most cases \\"haben\\" (have), and the past participle of the main verb, in this case \\"gestimmt\\". 'In favor of' carries the meaning of supporting or approving something. It is translated to 'für', a German preposition which similarly denotes a support or advantage towards the noun that follows it. 'This report' translates to 'diesen Bericht'. This is a standard straightforward translation where 'this' is 'diesen' and 'report' is 'Bericht' in German. Even though translation can ideally be straightforward, language is intrinsically linked and contextualized to culture. Therefore, it's important to understand the cultural background and the linguistic idiosyncrasies of the languages you want to translate. For example, German language structure can seem flexible - sometimes you can start sentences with the verb or the object rather than the subject - which is quite different from English. Understanding these intricacies helps with more accurate and nuanced translations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Prisons: Brown drops defiance, but what about compliance? Gov. Jerry Brown has apparently decided to stop thumbing his nose at the federal court that oversees health care and population levels in California’s prisons, a court that has threatened to hold him in contempt if he doesn’t obey its orders. But he’s apparently holding onto his unorthodox view of the law that the court will apply. Last week the three-judge court reaffirmed its mandate that the state reduce the inmate population to 109,500, or 137.5 percent of designed capacity, by the end of this year. The court first issued its order in 2009 after finding that overcrowding was the primary cause of the dreadful quality of health care in the prisons. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision in 2011, and despite Brown’s proclamation in January that the medical system is now a model for the nation and there’s no need for further population reductions, the panel ruled April 11 that the prisons are still overcrowded and health care still violates constitutional standards. Brown was on his China tour when the ruling came out, and his first response was almost dismissive. “I’m sure the people in L.A. would like to see more prisoners out on the streets,” he said, according to one published report. “See, we have two problems here: some are saying there are too many people being let loose, and then we have the judges saying, not enough, we need another 10,000 out there.” That won’t happen, the governor told reporters, “until we appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.” A day later, Brown said he’d spoken with the state’s lawyers, who reminded him that the three-judge panel had given the state three weeks to present a plan to reduce the inmate population by 10,000, and that the Supreme Court, which has ruled against the state once before in the case, might not issue a stay. “We’ve got to come up with a plan,” he acknowledged. Still, Brown insisted California’s prisons have “among the best health care in America and probably in the world.” Although court-appointed monitors who inspected the prisons have concluded otherwise, Brown said he’ll make his own inspection tour shortly. “But I have to tell you the constitutional standard is deliberate indifference,” he said, referring to the standards courts have set for inmates who sue for violations of their rights. “And as far as I know there is no one deliberately indifferent to the health needs of California prisoners, and if I find such a person, he will be fired on the spot.” Based on what the courts have ruled so far, he might try looking in the mirror. The prisoners who filed suit over their mental health treatment in 1991, and over their medical care in 2001, weren’t accusing individual doctors, nurses or guards of being deliberately indifferent to their rights. They were accusing the state government and its top officials, including the governor — the lead defendant in the case — and his corrections director. Federal judges have proceeded to find that California was severely lacking in medical staff and facilities and in the quality of care it provided in prisons that were jammed to nearly twice their designed capacity. When the three-judge court ordered the state to reduce the inmate population by about 34,000, Brown responded with realignment, which lowered the population by 24,000 by sentencing low-level felons to county jail instead of prison. He then said he’d done enough, and brushed off the court’s suggestions to reduce sentences for some nonviolent crimes, increase paroles of low-risk offenders and give inmates more time off their sentences for good behavior. Brown and other state officials have engaged in openly contemptuous conduct, the court said in last week’s ruling, by “repeatedly ignoring both this court’s order and at least three explicit admonitions to take all steps necessary to comply with that order.” All they have submitted so far, the judges said, is ”a plan for non-compliance.” And if they don’t start complying, starting with the population-reduction plan due by the start of next month, “they will without further delay be subject to findings of contempt, individually and collectively.” People can be thrown in jail for contempt, though judges usually impose fines instead when government officials are involved. In any event, the court has gotten Brown’s attention, and will be keeping a close eye on his response. We in the press corps will do so as well.

In a significant departure, the new method also counts strokes as well as heart attacks in its risk calculations, a step that will probably make some additional people candidates for the drugs. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is not clear whether more or fewer people will end up taking the drugs under the new guidelines, experts said. Many women and African-Americans, who have a higher-than-average risk of stroke, may find themselves candidates for treatment, but others taking statins only to lower LDL cholesterol to target levels may no longer need them. The previous guidelines put such a strong emphasis on lowering cholesterol levels by specific amounts that patients who did not hit their target levels just by taking statins often were prescribed additional drugs like Zetia, made by Merck. But the new guidelines say doctors should no longer prescribe those extra medicines because they have never been shown to prevent heart attacks or strokes. Zetia has been viewed with increasing skepticism in recent years since studies showed it lowered LDL cholesterol but did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease or death. Still, it is among Merck’s top-selling drugs, earning 2.6 billion last year. Another drug, Vytorin, which combines Zetia with a statin, brought in 1.8 billion in 2012, according to company filings. And in May, Merck won approval for another drug, Liptruzet, which also contains the active ingredient in Zetia and a statin, a development that surprised many cardiologists because of questions about its effectiveness. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The new guidelines are part of a package of recommendations to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke that includes moderate exercise and a healthy diet. But its advice on cholesterol is the flash point, arousing the ire of critics who say the authors ignored evidence that did not come from gold-standard clinical trials and should also have counted less rigorous, but compelling, data. Advertisement Continue reading the main story For example, Dr. Daniel J. Rader, the director of the preventive cardiovascular medicine and lipid clinic at the University of Pennsylvania, points to studies of people with genes giving them low LDL levels over a lifetime. Their heart attack rate is greatly reduced, he said, suggesting the benefits of long-term cholesterol reduction. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Committee members counter his view, saying that cholesterol lowered by drugs may not have the same effect. Photo Critics also question the use of a 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke as the measure for determining who should be treated. Many people will have a lower risk simply because they are younger, yet could benefit from taking statins for decades to keep their cholesterol levels low, they say. Dr. Rader and other experts also worry that without the goad of target numbers, patients and their doctors will lose motivation to control cholesterol levels. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Experts say it is still unclear how much the new guidelines will change clinical practice. Dr. Rader suspects many cardiologists will still strive for the old LDL targets, at least for patients with heart disease who are at high risk. “They are used to it and believe in it,” he said.

Large clinical trials have consistently shown that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but the committee concluded that there is no evidence that hitting specific cholesterol targets makes a difference. No one has ever asked in a rigorous study if a person’s risk is lower with an LDL of 70 than 90 or 100, for example. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Neil J. Stone, the chairman of the committee and a professor of preventive cardiology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said he was surprised by what the group discovered as it delved into the evidence. “We deliberated for several years,” he said, “and could not come up with solid evidence for targets.” Dr. Nissen, who was not a member of the committee, agreed. “The science was never there” for the LDL targets, he said. Past committees “made them up out of thin air,” he added. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Department of Veterans Affairs conducted its own independent review and came to the same conclusion. About a year ago, the department, the nation’s largest integrated health care system, dropped its LDL targets, said Dr. John Rumsfeld, the V.A.'s national director of cardiology. “It is a shift,” he acknowledged, “but I would argue that it is not a radical change but is a course correction.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Paul M. Ridker, the director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in Boston, said he worried the new guidelines could easily lead to overtreatment. An older man with a low LDL level who smokes and has moderately elevated blood pressure would qualify for a statin under the new guidelines. But what he really needs is to stop smoking and get his blood pressure under control. Dr. Stone said he hoped doctors would not reflexively prescribe a statin to such a patient. Doctors are supposed to talk to their patients and realize that, with a man like the one Dr. Ridker described, the real problem was not cholesterol.

They focus on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, a new way to assess risk and a healthy lifestyle. (No AP The updated recommendations for treating cholesterol are \\"a huge, huge departure\\" from doctors' usual procedure. People take the statin Lipitor for lowering blood cholesterol. (Photo: Mel Evans, AP) Story Highlights According to the new criteria, 31% of adults are good candidates for statins, compared with 15.5% now Some experts worry about exposing more people to statins' side effects, including higher risk of diabetes The guidelines eliminate benchmark numbers for cholesterol readings Twice as many Americans will be eligible for cholesterol-lowering drugs, based on controversial new heart guidelines from two of the USA's leading cardiovascular associations. The number of adults considered likely to benefit from statins will rise from about 15.5% today to 31%, according to the new criteria, developed by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. While statins have been widely prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attacks, the new guidelines recommend that they also be considered for people at high risk of stroke. STORY: New guidelines for treating obesity, too That advice could lead doctors to prescribe statins to millions more people, says Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, who wasn't involved in the new guidelines. \\"It's going to cause a huge conversation,\\" says Mariell Jessup, president of the heart association. \\"It may be very controversial — which is fine. Controversy means discussion.\\" Authors of the new guidelines say they hope to get statins to more patients who need them, while avoiding unnecessary prescriptions for people unlikely to benefit. The guidelines also call for doctors to work closely with patients to improve their diets and increase exercise. Rita Redberg, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco, says she is concerned about exposing more patients to statins' side effects, which include an increased risk of diabetes, as well as muscle pain. The average patient is likely to notice two major changes in the way that doctors manage their cholesterol, experts say. For years, doctors often prescribed statins based on patients' cholesterol levels, especially their LDL, known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. The new guidelines advise doctors to base their decisions on a patient's overall risk, rather than just their cholesterol. Nissen notes that even patients with normal cholesterol can have heart attacks. \\"It's a huge, huge departure from the way that people have been thinking about cholesterol and heart disease,\\" says Harlan Krumholz, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine. \\"Doctors today are obsessed with numbers.\\" The guidelines identify four high-risk groups who could benefit from statins: people with pre-existing heart disease, such as those who have had a heart attack; people ages 40 to 75 who have diabetes; patients ages 40 to 75 with at least a 7.5% risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next decade, according to a formula described in the guidelines; and patients with the sort of super-high cholesterol that sometimes runs in families, as evidenced by an LDL of 190 milligrams per deciliter or higher. These changes will help doctors to focus not just on \\"lab values,\\" but on the whole patient, including a patient's weight, blood pressure, use of tobacco, diet, physical activity and other considerations, Krumholz says. Doctors have focused heavily in recent years on using drugs to reduce LDL to certain benchmark levels: under 130 for most people; 100 for people at high-risk; under 70 for those at the highest risk, such as those who have just survived a heart attack. Doctors have raised or lowered medication doses to help patients meet these targets, Nissen says. The new guidelines get rid of these targets, says Carl Orringer, a cardiologist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. Instead, doctors are encouraged to put patients on doses proven to work. The expert panel decided to eliminate these benchmarks because no one has ever tested them in a randomized, controlled trial — the gold standard for medical evidence, Nissen says. While studies clearly show that lower LDL is better, there's really no data to support using one cutoff or another. Getting doctors to change their practices could be difficult, Nissen says. That's because numbers are easy to understand, both for busy physicians and patients without a medical background. Having a \\"target\\" cholesterol in mind has seemed helpful to many doctors and patients, because it has given them goals to work toward. About 600,000 Americans die from heart disease every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FILE - This undated photo provided by by Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc., shows Atorvastatin Calcium tablets, a generic form of Lipitor, which is being sold under a deal with Pfizer. The nation's first new... (Associated Press) The guidelines, issued Tuesday by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology, are a big change. They use a new formula for estimating someone's risk that includes many factors besides cholesterol, the main focus now. They take aim at strokes, not just heart attacks. And they set a lower threshold for using medicines to reduce risk. The definition of high cholesterol isn't changing, but the treatment goal is. Instead of aiming for a specific number, using whatever drugs get a patient there, the advice stresses statins such as Lipitor and Zocor and identifies four groups of people they help the most. \\"The emphasis is to try to treat more appropriately,\\" said Dr. Neil Stone, the Northwestern University doctor who headed the cholesterol guideline panel. \\"We're going to give statins to those who are the most likely to benefit.\\" Doctors say the new approach will limit how many people with low heart risks are put on statins simply because of a cholesterol number. Yet under the new advice, 33 million Americans _ 44 percent of men and 22 percent of women _ would meet the threshold to consider taking a statin. Under the current guidelines, statins are recommended for only about 15 percent of adults. Some doctors not involved in writing the guidance worry that it will be tough to understand. \\"It will be controversial, there's no question about it. For as long as I remember, we've told physicians and patients we should treat their cholesterol to certain goal levels,\\" said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Steven Nissen. \\"There is concern that there will be a lot of confusion about what to do.\\" The government's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute appointed expert panels to write the new guidelines in 2008, but in June said it would leave drafting them to the Heart Association and College of Cardiology. New guidelines on lifestyle and obesity also came out Tuesday, and ones on blood pressure are coming soon. Roughly half the cholesterol panel members have financial ties to makers of heart drugs, but panel leaders said no one with industry connections could vote on the recommendations. \\"It is practically impossible to find a large group of outside experts in the field who have no relationships to industry,\\" said Dr. George Mensah of the heart institute. He called the guidelines \\"a very important step forward\\" based on solid evidence, and said the public should trust them. Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. High cholesterol leads to hardened arteries that can cause a heart attack or stroke. Most cholesterol is made by the liver, so diet changes have a limited effect on it. Millions of Americans take statins, which reduce cholesterol dramatically and have other effects that more broadly lower the chances of heart trouble. The patents on Lipitor, Zocor and other statins have expired, and they are widely available in generic versions for as little as a dime a day. One that is still under patent protection is AstraZeneca's Crestor, which had sales of 8.3 billion in 2012. Despite a small increased risk of muscle problems and accelerating diabetes in patients already at risk for it, statins are \\"remarkably safe drugs\\" whose benefits outweigh their risks, said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, preventive-medicine chief at Northwestern. Current guidelines say total cholesterol should be under 200, and LDL, or \\"bad cholesterol,\\" under l00. Other drugs such as niacin and fibrates are sometimes added to statins to try to reach those goals, but studies show they don't always lower the chances of heart problems. \\"Chasing numbers can lead us to using drugs that haven't been proven to help patients. You can make someone's lab test look better without making them better,\\" said Yale University cardiologist Dr. Harlan Krumholz, who has long urged the broader risk approach the new guidelines take. They say statins do the most good for: _People who already have heart disease. _Those with LDL of 190 or higher, usually because of genetic risk. _People ages 40 to 75 with Type 2 diabetes. _People ages 40 to 75 who have an estimated 10-year risk of heart disease of 7.5 percent or higher, based on the new formula. (This means that for every 100 people with a similar risk profile, seven or eight would have a heart attack or stroke within 10 years.) Aspirin _ widely used to lower the risk of strokes and heart attacks _ is not addressed in the guidelines. And many drugs other than statins are still recommended for certain people, such as those with high triglycerides. Patients should not stop taking any heart drug without first checking with their doctor. The guidelines also say: _Adults 40 to 79 should get an estimate every four to six years of their chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke over the next decade using the new formula. It includes age, sex, race, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and smoking. If risk remains unclear, doctors can consider family history or three other tests. The best one is a coronary artery calcium test, an X-ray to measure calcium in heart arteries. _For those 20 to 59, an estimate of their lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke can be considered using traditional factors like cholesterol and blood pressure to persuade them to change their lifestyle. _To fight obesity, doctors should develop individualized weight loss plans including a moderately reduced calorie diet, exercise and behavior strategies. The best ones offer two or three in-person meetings a month for at least six months. Web or phone-based programs are a less-ideal option. _Everyone should get at least 40 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise three or four times a week. _People should eat a \\"dietary pattern\\" focused on vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Include low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, beans and healthy oils and nuts. Limit sweets, sweet drinks, red meat, saturated fat and salt. \\"I don't like the concept of 'good foods' and 'bad foods,'\\" said Dr. Robert Eckel, a University of Colorado cardiologist who worked on the guidelines. \\"We really want to emphasize dietary patterns.\\" ___ Online: Risk formula: http://my.americanheart.org/cvriskcalculator Guidelines on cholesterol: http://bit.ly/1j2hDpH Lifestyle: http://bit.ly/16ZnV7e Overweight: http://bit.ly/1bsdFG2 Risk Assessment: http://bit.ly/19hzaV9 Cholesterol info: http://tinyurl.com/2dtc5vy Heart facts: http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/127/1/e6 ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP ||||| Story highlights New guidelines could double the number of folks eligible for medication, experts say These guidelines call for a focus on risk factors, not just cholesterol levels The policy say it's important how patients lower \\"bad\\" cholesterol If you're not on medicine to lower your cholesterol yet, you might be soon. In what's being called a tectonic shift in the way doctors will treat high cholesterol, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology on Tuesday released new treatment guidelines calling for a focus on risk factors rather than just cholesterol levels. The new guidelines could double the amount of people on medication to lower their cholesterol, experts say. \\"This is an enormous shift in policy as it relates to who should be treated for high levels of cholesterol,\\" said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. The biggest change from the old guidelines, he says: Ignore the numbers. \\"For many years, the goal was to get the 'bad' cholesterol levels -- or LDL levels -- below 100,\\" Nissen said. \\"Those targets have been completely eliminated in the new guidelines, and the threshold for treatment has been eliminated.\\" JUST WATCHED Report: More Americans should take statins Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Test your cholesterol knowledge 01:15 JUST WATCHED Know your cholesterol numbers Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Know your cholesterol numbers 01:33 In their place, the guidelines suggest using specific risk factors to determine who should be treated with cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, and who should simply make lifestyle changes. Among the four questions to ask to determine risks: Do you have heart disease? Do you have diabetes (Type 1 or 2)? Do you have a bad cholesterol level more than 190? And is your 10-year risk of a heart attack greater than 7.5%? According to the new guidelines, if you answered yes to any of those four questions, you should be on a statin. Period. New drugs could drop cholesterol to extreme lows For those who do not fit those criteria, the committee behind the new policy says lifestyle and behavior management should be sufficient to help manage high cholesterol. \\"The focus for years has been on getting the LDL low,\\" said Dr. Neil Stone, committee chairman. \\"Our guidelines are not against that. We're simply saying how you get the LDL low is important. Considering all the possible treatments, we recommend a heart-healthy lifestyle and statin therapy for the best chance of reducing your risk of stroke or heart attack in the next 10 years.\\" Calculating risks So how do you and your doctor determine if your 10-year risk of a heart attack is above 7.5% and you should be put on a statin? A simple calculation, said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, chairman of the committee that developed the equation. \\"We were able to generate very robust risk equations for both non-Hispanic white men and women as well as African-American men and women,\\" Lloyd-Jones said. \\"Those equations factor in age, sex, race, total and HDL ('good') cholesterol levels, blood pressure levels, blood pressure treatment status as well as diabetes and current smoking status.\\" Each of those factors is assigned a numerical value and can be used to determine individual risk percentage using an online calculator. The hope, Lloyd-Jones said, is that by doing these calculations, patients can be more informed about their risks when going to see doctors. \\"The greatest strength behind these guidelines is that they hit at the heart of prevention -- which is that lifestyle, rather than treating isolated risk factors, is the key to reducing risk of chronic disease,\\" said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, an assistant professor of medicine at Emory University, in an e-mail. \\"We tend to focus on 'quick fix' answers such as a pill ... whereas the risk reduction from lifestyle changes, such (as) exercise three-four days a week, reduces risk nearly double to that from any one of the medication interventions.\\" Double the prescriptions By changing the way doctors evaluate a patient for statin therapy, Nissen said these new guidelines will effectively double the number of Americans eligible for statin therapy, bringing the total to about 72 million. How to boost your 'good' cholesterol So does this mean big bucks for the pharmaceutical companies? Nissen said no -- and in fact, it may mean a downturn in their business. \\"Now, except for Crestor, they're virtually all generic -- you can get a three-month supply for 10,\\" he said. \\"So there's really no money to be made with statins anymore.\\" He goes on to say that while prescriptions for these drugs will increase dramatically, the guidelines all but shunned other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Zetia, a big moneymaker for Merck & Co. Aside from the financial aspects of medicating 35 million more Americans, using statins in a much broader population has been controversial. Some people, such as cancer expert Dr. David Agus, advocate giving everyone older than 45 a statin, due both to cholesterol-lowering properties and potential benefit in reducing cancer. Others say that with the potential side effects from statin use -- muscle pains and soreness, a potential moderate increase in liver disease and a risk for developing Type 2 diabetes -- they should be used with care. Nissen, who strongly disagrees with Agus' suggestion on statins, said a measured approach is best. \\"If you have a young woman who is otherwise healthy, giving (her) a statin doesn't make any sense at all,\\" Nissen said. \\"I do believe the evidence is solid that if you have risk, that statins are enormously beneficial.\\" Other recommendations In addition to the guidelines on evaluating cholesterol risk, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology released two other sets of guidelines relating to overall heart health. One report gives guidelines for eating a heart-healthy diet, including reducing saturated and trans fats as well as limiting sodium to 2,400 milligrams per day -- 30% less than the average American consumes on a daily basis. Cholesterol levels: What numbers should you aim for? The other report dealt with treatment guidelines for physicians on managing weight loss in their patients. They include a call to create individualized weight loss plans and recommend counseling with a dietitian or other certified weight loss professional for at least six months. That report also goes on to suggest that doctors should begin offering bariatric surgery as a potentially viable option to improve health for patients with a body mass index over 40, or those with a BMI over 35 and other complicating factors. ||||| Solution:","completion":"The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released new guidelines for treating high cholesterol.

Later that night, the three snobs sneak back into the inn and assault Christina's father, killing him.Hans is arrested for the murder. Despite the sterling character references of Dr Hertz and Frankenstein, the testimony of Anton, Johann and Karl persuade the jury. Because Hans will not reveal his whereabouts during the time of the murder -- he was making love with Christina -- he is sentenced to die at the same guillotine that killed his father some twenty years earlier.Frankenstein sees this as an opportunity to test his new machinery on a human, and he has Dr Hertz arrange to receive Hans's dead body.

She had been working on a doctorate in English, but once she married Richard (Gregg Edelman) and had their daughter, the presently five-year-old Lucy (Sadie Goldstein), she set aside her research. Now she spends her days taking Lucy to a local park along with three other stay at-home mothers: the severe and judgmental Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) and more timid Theresa (Trini Alvorado) and Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein). They enjoy ogling from a distance Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), the handsome and well built father who brings his son, Aaron (Ty Simpkins), to the park. When their children use the same swing set, Sarah and Brad have an opportunity to talk to one another, titillating the other women. But when they, on a lark, hug and kiss, the women immediately take their children out of the park and refuse to associate with Sarah anymore.Both Brad and Sarah have unhappy home lives. Brad has yet to pass the Massachusetts state bar exam and doesn't even want to be a lawyer. However, his bossy wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), pushes him to succeed. She makes documentaries for public television for a living. They live a bit beyond their means, forcing them to accept financial support from Kathy's mother.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the names of the three people who left the Guide Course? In the interim came The Beatles, a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \\"Guide Course\\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \\"Maharishi\\", renamed \\"Sexy Sadie\\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \\"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\\"During recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \\"Dear Prudence\\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" he scorned as \\"granny music shit\\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \\"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the...

SEC Media Days: Nick Saban speaks, Conley stars and Freak's bold words Nick Saban batted clean-up for what proved to be a pretty tame SEC Media Days this week save for a huge influx of bow-ties. The Alabama coach did, as usual, come ready with some key talking points for the media. * Saban said he'd be all for playing Alabama's entire schedule against opponents from the Big Five conferences. \\"You know, it's what the fans want,\\" he said. \\"We need to be more concerned about the people who come to support the programs and the university and see the games. ... I'm all for playing as many good, quality games for the players, fans and the betterment of our game.\\" * On what he described as the evolving culture of young people in our society, Saban said he's noticed the maturity gap between the older guys and the younger guys in his locker room seems to widen every year. \\"I think we have to support them and teach them and get them to do the right thing. Controlling these impulsive behaviors is a little bit different for us now than it was when we were 17, 18 years old. We need to help this process. You see that the process (The Process) really does work. It has a tremendous effect.\\" He also pointed out several times over the course of the day that no player he's ever kicked out of his football program has ever gone someplace else and had any success. \\"Discipline is not punishment,\\" he said. \\"Punishment is only effective when it can help change someone's behavior.\\" * When asked about the potential for the College Football Playoff to expand beyond four teams, he said he doesn't like answering hypotheticals but if it does expand maybe they should get rid of conference title games. * Saban is pleased with new 'Bama OC Lane Kiffin: \\"He's smart, players respond to him well. So far, so good.\\" * Oh, and Saban hopes the media finally nails a preseason prediction. As he noted a few times Thursday: In 22 preseason polls, the media have never been right when picking Alabama and have never picked Alabama in the years that the Crimson Tide has won the SEC title. \\"You've been wrong five years in a row, and every year we've won it,” Saban said. “But I'm rooting for you.\\" The Most Interesting Man in the SEC is Georgia wideout Chris Conley, who wrote and directed a \\"Star Wars\\" fan film, \\"Retribution.\\" The 6-foot-3, 206-pound senior basically charmed everyone in Hoover on Thursday, including the cameramen shooting his interviews. (Conley could talk about the type of film he's using for his movies.) He said he’s working on a 30-minute short film about superheroes. \\"I think there's a lot of fans of that genre,\\" the big receiver said, who wore his Batman socks in honor of the new project. Conley appealed to the NCAA so he could fund the film. Initially, it was denied, but then he won an appeal. A Kickstarter campaign begins in the fall in hopes of raising 50,000-70,000. Shooting for the trailer starts soon, he said. Asked if Lucas Films hasn't been in touch with the budding filmmaker, Conley smiled: \\"I'm kinda hoping that they don't because that might mean a lawsuit.\\" Conley and I spoke about his frustration over the negative perception some have about college football players with all the police-blotter news in the offseason these days. \\"It is frustrating because I know that is just the 1 percent,\\" he said. \\"I know hundreds of other guys are doing it right and they're not out there making a fool of themselves or their university, but no one wants to report on that. And that is unfortunate about the way media works today. \\"I think there's not enough publicity for the players that are doing it right,\\" he said. \\"We're looking at this college experience as an opportunity. I feel like we should be showing more of that, and it really encourages me to keep doing what I'm doing and to push the limits and see how much more you can do while still being a successful student-athlete. \\"We have to learn how to portray a better image so we can help others.\\" And, no, in case you were wondering, he has zero interest in someday getting into politics. * Bo Wallace is one of the most proven QBs in the SEC this season, but this fall, he's hoping to prove he has a big-time arm. Wallace said he's bulked up 15 pounds to 223. He also has given a lot of credit to noted biomechanics whiz Tom House, whom he spent a week working with in Los Angeles this summer (Full disclosure: I'll have a lot more on this stuff in my upcoming book, \\"The QB,\\" later in the fall.) \\"My sequencing was out (of whack),\\" he said. \\"Usually, your hips come first and then your shoulder, and it creates the torque. I was getting no torque. It was almost a complete overhaul (of Wallace's throwing motion.)\\" Wallace believes the work will enable him and the Rebels to be able to work downfield in the passing game a lot more. * Ole Miss DE C.J. Johnson on touted sophomore D-lineman Robert Nkemdiche getting even bigger this offseason: \\"I ain't never seen anybody 295 pounds with abs like he's 125 pounds like him before.\\" * Kentucky's Bud Dupree was a member of this year's Freaks list and said he plans to more than back that up on the field this fall and at the NFL Combine down the road. The 268-pound DE says he expects he'll vertical 42 inches and broad jump well more than 11 feet. \\"I will blow the Combine up.\\" Dupree credits a big change in his diet for his development this year. He cut out eating fast foods and fried foods entirely after he used to eat it five days a week. Now he says he eats grilled chicken and fish almost exclusively.

Please answer the following question: My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.

Options: - embarrassment indictment - tension - going to jail - penalty - mistrial Explain why a human would choose \\"tension\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"tension\\" to answer the question above because it best represents the emotional state one might experience while committing perjury. Perjury, which is the act of knowingly making false statements under oath, is a serious offense that can lead to significant legal consequences. This level of wrongdoing can create a high level of stress and anxiety for the person committing the act. To further understand why \\"tension\\" is the chosen answer, let's examine the other given options: 1. Embarrassment indictment: Although this phrase combines two potentially related aspects - embarrassment (emotional state) and indictment (legal outcome) - it does not accurately depict the feelings one might have while committing perjury. An indictment may be a result of committing perjury, and embarrassment could be a consequence, but neither of these terms fully capture the emotional intensity of committing such an act. 2. Going to jail: While going to jail is a possible consequence of committing perjury, it is not an emotional state or feeling. Therefore, it cannot be the correct answer to describe how someone may feel while committing perjury. 3. Penalty: Similar to the previous option, a penalty is a consequence of perjury, rather than a description of how someone might feel while engaging in the act itself. 4. Mistrial: A mistrial refers to a situation in which a trial is rendered invalid due to an error, misconduct, or a hung jury. While perjury may contribute to a mistrial, this term does not describe the emotional state of someone committing perjury. On the other hand, \\"tension\\" denotes a state of mental or emotional strain, often arising from adverse or demanding circumstances. Committing perjury involves knowingly lying under oath, which can lead to significant emotional strain and internal conflict for the individual due to the potential consequences and the weight of the dishonest act. A person committing perjury is likely to feel intense pressure and anxiety, fearing the possibility of being caught and facing repercussions. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"tension\\" to answer the question as it best reflects the strong emotional stress an individual may experience while committing perjury. The term \\"tension\\" encompasses feelings of stress, fear, and anxiety that one would likely feel while undertaking such a high-stakes, unlawful act."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position? Question: \\"What type of energy do a moving arrow or ball have?\\" Answer: \\"Potential\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: There is a Web site called the \\"World Database of Happiness.\\" It combines and analyzes the results of hundreds of surveys from around the world that have been conducted on life satisfaction. Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money. Options: A Sudden wealth. B Surfing the Internet. C Family relationship. D Winning lottery. Answer: C Family relationship. Question: Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the World Database of Happiness, which factor is most strongly associated with long-term contentment? A) Sudden wealth B) Surfing the Internet C) Family relationships D) Winning the lottery Answer: C) Family relationships"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Galina and a group of terrorists Answer:","completion":"Title: The Albatross Conspiracy Genre: Action, Thriller, Crime Plot: The story starts with Galina Petrov (played by Scarlett Johansson), a talented Russian computer hacker living a double life; as a low-key programmer in a tech company by day and a subversive cyberactivist by night. Galina's ultimate motivation for hacking is to expose the corrupt and powerful, but her recent activities have garnered the attention of an international terrorist group named \\"Albatross.\\" Albatross, led by Hussein Aziz (played by Idris Elba), is known for its sophisticated operation and the use of technology to carry out their highly impactful attacks on various national and international targets. Albatross, having infiltrated Galina's online presence, decides to enlist her talents for an infiltration mission that will attack the deepest and most guarded secrets of the world's superpowers. Unbeknownst to Galina, she was manipulated into joining Albatross through a mix of deception and coercion involving her family's safety. As Galina starts working with Albatross, she uncovers the details of \\"Project Erebus,\\" a top-secret global surveillance system developed by a clandestine organization operating within the most powerful governments in the world. Project Erebus has the potential to shift the balance of power in the world immensely, and Albatross plans to use this system to execute a series of coordinated attacks against its perceived enemies. Knowing the strength and influence of Albatross, Galina is torn between staying with the terrorist group to ensure her family's safety or breaking away and exposing their evil plans. With a strong sense of duty, Galina decides she can't allow Albatross to carry out their nefarious scheme. However, she stays within the group, all the while working against them by secretly leaking information to a contact within the CIA, Agent Daniel Collins (played by Chris Hemsworth). Agent Collins, with the help of Galina, forms a secret international task force composed of top intelligence officers and operatives from various countries, aiming to dismantle Albatross and thwart their plans. The task force, aptly named \\"The Titan Unit,\\" races against time and faces a deadly cat-and-mouse game, as they must avoid detection and dismantle the terrorist group without drawing any attention to themselves. As the story unfolds, Galina gathers enough evidence and information, leading to the climactic confrontation against Albatross. The Titan Unit takes on the terrorist group in a series of high-stakes action sequences set in various locations across the globe. In the end, Galina and the task force manage to dismantle Albatross and neutralize Project Erebus while ensuring her family's safety. However, the story doesn't end there. The Titan Unit discovers a list of names of compromised government officials, including those within their own ranks, who were involved in the Erebus project, leaving the world to wonder who can be trusted, and setting the stage for a potential sequel. The movie explores themes of betrayal, loyalty, and the gray areas between right and wrong. The Albatross Conspiracy showcases the courage of ordinary people thrown into extraordinary circumstances while highlighting the power of technology and its potential dangers when in the wrong hands. It will be a thrilling, action-packed, and thought-provoking film that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you bump an order at a restaurant? Select from the following. a). take the order receipt off the rim.. b). cancel the order..","completion":"To accomplish the goal of bumping an order at a restaurant, one could follow the steps below: Step 1: Assess the situation First, determine the reason for bumping the order. This could be due to a customer request, an error in the order, or a need to prioritize a different order. Step 2: Choose the appropriate action Based on the available options, the appropriate action should result in successfully bumping the order. Option a). Take the order receipt off the rim This option would involve taking the order receipt off the rim where it is displayed for the kitchen staff. By doing so, the kitchen staff would not see the order and would move on to the next order in line. This could be a practical option if the goal is to temporarily delay the order for some reason (e.g., an ingredient issue, a kitchen staff issue, or to prioritize a more urgent order). Afterwards, the order receipt can be placed back on the rim for the kitchen staff to resume working on it. Option b). Cancel the order Cancelling the order would involve voiding the order altogether. This means the kitchen staff would not work on it at all. This is a more permanent and drastic option, which would make sense only if there was an issue with the order itself or at the customer's request. Based on these options, the best course of action would depend on the context and reason for bumping the order. If it's a temporary or minor issue, then option a). Take the order receipt off the rim would be a better choice. However, if the order needs to be completely removed due to an issue with the order or at the customer's request, then option b). Cancel the order would be the appropriate step to take. Step 3: Communicate with the necessary parties After choosing the appropriate action, communicate the decision made to kitchen staff, waitstaff, and, if needed, the customer. This will ensure that everyone involved is informed of the change in the order status and can adjust accordingly. Step 4: Monitor the situation Finally, monitor the situation to ensure the bumped order is handled as intended. If the order needs to be replaced or resumed, make sure it is done so in a timely manner to minimize the impact on the customer's experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The formation of caves in limestone rock structures is a fascinating geological process that occurs over long periods of time through a combination of natural events and chemical reactions. The first step of this process involves the interaction of rainwater with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which results in the formation of a weak acidic solution. This solution is key to initiating the series of events that ultimately lead to the creation of a cave. Here's a detailed explanation of this initial process: 1. Formation of Carbonic Acid: As rainwater falls through the Earth's atmosphere, it comes into contact with carbon dioxide (CO2) which dissolves into the water droplets. This interaction results in the formation of a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3) solution. This acidic solution is relatively mild, but its acidity plays a crucial role in the successive steps involved in the formation of caves in limestone regions. 2. Infiltration of Acidic Rainwater: Once the acidic rainwater reaches the ground, it starts to percolate through the soil, seeping into cracks and fissures in the underlying rock layers. In regions with limestone bedrock, these fractures provide pathways for the weak carbonic acid solution to penetrate deeper into the rock formations. 3. Dissolution of Limestone: Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which is vulnerable to chemical weathering processes due to its solubility in weak acidic solutions. When the carbonic acid solution infiltrates the limestone, a chemical reaction occurs where the acid breaks down the calcium carbonate, releasing calcium ions (Ca2+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) into the solution. The overall reaction can be summarized as follows: CaCO3 (limestone) + H2CO3 (carbonic acid) → Ca2+ (calcium ions) + 2HCO3- (bicarbonate ions) 4. The Slow Disintegration of Limestone: This chemical dissolution of limestone by the infiltrating carbonic acid solution occurs over long periods of time, and results in the gradual disintegration and removal of the limestone. The process is further accelerated by the continuous influx of acidic rainwater and the natural movement of groundwater in the rock fractures. As the limestone disintegrates and erodes, it creates channels and voids in the bedrock, contributing to the initial cave formation. In conclusion, the first step in the process of cave formation in limestone regions is the interaction of rainwater with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, resulting in the formation of a weak carbonic acid solution. This acidic solution plays a pivotal role in initiating the series of events that ultimately lead to the development of caves, as it triggers the dissolution and disintegration of limestone when it infiltrates the rock layers. Over long periods of time, this continuous chemical weathering of the limestone eventually results in the formation of large underground cavities, which we commonly refer to as caves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ariidae or ariid catfish are a family of catfish that mainly live in marine waters with many freshwater and brackish water species . They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones . The family includes about 143 species . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. 'ariidae' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?

Review: Title: A Wonderful Night at Bella's Italian Bistro! Last Friday, my family and I decided to visit Bella's Italian Bistro, located in downtown Springfield. We were eager to celebrate my sister's graduation, and Bella's was the perfect pick for our special night. Upon entering the restaurant, we were immediately impressed by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The soft lighting, beautiful artwork on the walls, and cozy seating arrangement made us feel right at home. Our server, Anna, promptly greeted us with a smile and friendly conversation, instantly making us feel welcome. One of the standout features of our visit was the incredible food. From the moment the starters arrived, we knew we were in for a treat. The bruschetta was fresh and full of flavor, while the fried calamari was crispy and perfectly cooked. For our entrees, I opted for the seafood linguine, which was mouthwatering and filled with succulent shrimp and scallops. My sister chose the classic lasagna, and she couldn't stop raving about the decadent layers of cheese and rich tomato sauce. In addition to the exceptional food, the service at Bella's was top-notch. Anna was attentive to our every need, providing suggestions and answering any questions we had about the menu. She even went above and beyond by bringing my sister a complimentary dessert to celebrate her graduation. I wholeheartedly recommend Bella's Italian Bistro to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience. Whether it's a special occasion or just a night out with friends or family, Bella's is sure to impress. I know I'll be returning soon, and I can't wait to try more of their delectable dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is this product review positive? Title: Terrible! Review: This was a really bad movie. Maybe it was a better book. The Harry Potter, and Narnia movies were so much better. I can see why there will probably not be a followup movie. Answer: OPTIONS: (A). No; (B). Yes; The answer is:","completion":"(A). No In this situation, the product review is negative, which can be determined by examining various aspects of the text. From the review, it is evident that the person who wrote the review did not enjoy the movie at all and found it inferior compared to other franchises such as Harry Potter and Narnia. Firstly, the title of the review \\"Terrible!\\" already indicates a negative sentiment. Words like terrible, awful, or horrible usually signify a negative evaluation of the product. In this instance, the title sets the tone for the rest of the review, highlighting the person's dissatisfaction with the movie they had seen. Additionally, the review contains a direct statement conveying the person's opinion on the movie: \\"This was a really bad movie.\\" The use of \\"really bad\\" is a clear expression of dislike and disappointment. This statement leaves no doubt about their negative sentiments towards the movie. Furthermore, the reviewer goes on to make comparisons with other, presumably more successful and enjoyable movie franchises like Harry Potter and Narnia. By emphasizing how much better those movies were compared to the one in question, the reviewer is, once again, highlighting their unfavorable opinion of the product. Lastly, the fact that the reviewer mentions they can see why there probably won't be a followup movie implies that the movie was not good enough to warrant a sequel or continuation of the story. This can be interpreted as another aspect of the negative review. Taking all these points into account, it is evident that this product review is not positive, but rather negative. The overall tone, the comparisons with other movies, and the anticipation of no follow-up movies all contribute to a negative evaluation of the movie in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: Let's begin with the chin. Hypothesis: You should never start with the chin. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The given premise and hypothesis present a presumed relationship between the starting point of a particular activity and whether the chin is an appropriate location to begin. To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to assess the underlying logic and argument structure. Let's analyze both the premise and hypothesis in detail. Premise: \\"Let's begin with the chin.\\" This statement suggests that one should commence a specific activity or process by focusing on the chin as the starting point. It does not inherently provide any information as to why this location is ideal or if it is the best option compared to other options. Furthermore, the premise does not offer context regarding which activity, task, or process the statement refers to, making it challenging to gauge its validity without additional information. Hypothesis: \\"You should never start with the chin.\\" The hypothesis is a more generalized statement that contradicts the premise. It asserts that the chin should never be used as the starting point for any given activity, task, or process. It is essential to note that the hypothesis is unconditional and implies that there is a universal principle or rule that applies to all situations – starting with the chin is always deemed inappropriate. Now, let's analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To establish if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, the premise must necessarily imply or lead to the conclusion presented by the hypothesis. In this case, the premise and hypothesis display opposing stances on whether the chin is an appropriate starting point. The premise suggests that one can begin with the chin, while the hypothesis asserts that one should never start with the chin. Based on this logical analysis, we can conclude that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. Instead, it contradicts the premise, negating the initial proposal to begin with the chin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - Guy Berkeley \`\` Berke '' Breathed ( / brðd / BREDH - d ; born June 21 , 1957 ) is an American cartoonist , children 's book author / illustrator , director and screenwriter , best known for Bloom County , a 1980s cartoon - comic strip that dealt with sociopolitical issues as understood by fanciful characters ( e.g. , Bill the Cat and Opus the Penguin ) and through humorous analogies .

The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States.

Review: I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments. \\"Unique\\", \\"intelligent\\", \\"A future cult classic\\" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort. Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. The silliness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And whatever \\"thinking\\" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess. OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually do better. It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences. If there is a major flaw in Altered, it's the main set. A major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details. There's nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans of \\"Blair Witch\\" are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still). Now, what is this review like? Available options: +negative; +positive;","completion":"This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses strong disappointment in the film \\"Altered,\\" pointing out various aspects they find lacking such as weak acting, poor directing, and an unengaging plot.

But dang.","completion":"The sentiment of this review can best be described as negative due to the various issues and dissatisfactions expressed by the reviewer. The primary source of dissatisfaction in this review is the apparent lack of efficient service experienced by the customer, prominently illustrated by the delay in having their order taken. Firstly, the customer mentions waiting for approximately 20 minutes after the waitress informed them she would go get a pen. This extended waiting period indicates a lack of urgency and professionalism, resulting in a negative sentiment towards the service. Secondly, the reviewer notes that the waitress who initially began serving them was the only one present in the establishment during their visit. This implies inadequate staffing, which could potentially contribute to slower service and an overall decline in the dining experience. Thirdly, the reviewer eventually receives assistance from a different waitress, further emphasizing their earlier dissatisfaction with the initial waitress and the establishment's lack of prompt service. Lastly, the customer expresses disappointment in the restaurant's policy regarding the selection of meats on their sliders. While the reviewer acknowledges that \\"policy is policy,\\" they express frustration at not being able to customize their meal as desired, further contributing to the negative sentiment of this review. In conclusion, this review conveys a strong sense of dissatisfaction with the service, punctuated by the extended wait times, perceived inadequate staffing, and inflexible restaurant policies.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”.

Mitt Romney: We're in extraordinary times and we need to stimulate economy. He says Obama's plan would stimulate the government more than economy. Giving people permanent tax relief would be better than higher spending, he says. Romney: Business is better than government at creating millions of jobs. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Mitt Romney Advocates Business-Led Economy Stimulus Over Higher Government Spending In recent remarks, former presidential nominee Mitt Romney has made his perspective clear on economic stimulus measures. Claiming that we are in extraordinary times, Romney suggested that the economy needs a boost. He opined that President Obama's current stimulus plan might stimulate the government more than the actual economy, implying that the benefits of Obama's plan might be skewed towards the public sector. Romney's argument seems to hinge on the idea that stimulating the government, while potentially beneficial for some aspects of society, does not have the same direct and immediate impact on the economy that other measures could offer. He questions whether public sector stimulus truly leads to overall economic growth. He also voices concern that elevated government spending could exacerbate the existing economic vulnerabilities. In response, Romney proposed an alternative solution – providing permanent tax relief to the people, arguing that it would be more effective than higher government spending. This shift in focus, from a government-led solution to a business- and individual-led one, implies that Romney believes that the private sector is better equipped to drive economic growth. Romney further explained his position by arguing that businesses are more capable than the government when it comes to creating jobs. He seems confident on the potential of free enterprise, suggesting that enabling businesses through permanent tax relief could lead to job creation on a scale of millions. The crux of the argument presented by Romney is a greater role for the private sector in leading the charge for economic recovery. He believes that the key to revitalizing a stagnant economy lies in empowering businesses and individuals through tax relief, thereby incentivising the creation of jobs, rather than relying solely on increased government spending. In conclusion, Mitt Romney advocates a paradigm shift – from government-centric stimulus measures more towards leveraging the dynamic potential of the private sector. This approach, Romney believes, would bring about a comprehensive and sustainable recovery of the economy. Whether or not his viewpoint gains traction remains to be seen, but it underscores the ongoing debate about the appropriate balance of public and private involvement in economic recovery efforts."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The boiler produces steam under high pressure - The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder - Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston - The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive&#x27;s wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod - As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive&#x27;s wheels and power the train along - An outlet valve opens and the piston pushes the steam back through the cylinder and out up the locomotive&#x27;s chimney - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step is: Fuel (coal, wood, or oil) is burned in a firebox, heating water in the boiler to create steam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: excellent made book about the films of Edgar Allan Poe Review: Since 1908 there have been more than 85 films from more than 13 countries based on the work of Poe - this book covers them all. It's excellent researched and good writen - the author has viewed most of them personally. There is also a included list of poe-inspired films, poe-films by country of origin, poe titles and films adapted from them and a bibliography. In one word: a reference source book.

Help as much as you can. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Will the amount of energy generated by the windmill increase or decrease if it is turning faster than normal? A windmill is used to power a nearby house. On days when there is almost no wind the house runs very low on power. But on days when there is a lot of wind, such as during a storm the reserve batteries for the house are able to charge to full. Hint: An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In our life, there are always some days that will never be forgotten. This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was. While crossing the creek by walking on a downed tree trunk, our little Izzie fell into the creek and immediately started moving up and down in the current . Immediately, I jumped into the creek after her. I managed to grab her and push her to the bank. But now, I was the one in need of being rescued. I thought this might be the end and I wasn't sure if I could hold on. Then, I heard the voice of the love of my life, my wife's voice. She shouted loudly--Stand up! Stand up! With the last bit of strength I had, I stood, and walked out of the creek. The kids showed little concern for my health; they were looking after Izzie, now safe in their arms. But I did hear one of the kids say: Thanks Dad, for saving Izzie. You're our HERO! As we walked back down the trail, I enjoyed a rare, but one of those sweet moments in life, that I wouldn't trade for anything on earth. I didn't care about my wet clothes, the squish of water in my boots, or the embarrassment of nearly drowning in water; none of that mattered. I just walked along following my family, with my head held up, my shoulders back and my chest pushed out proudly enjoying the fact that, at that moment in time, on that particular day in life, I was...

Question: suppose less salt water is boiled happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the process and discuss the effects of boiling less salt water: 1. A forest fire starts - Boiling less salt water has no direct impact on forest fires. Forest fires can be ignited by various factors like lightning, human activity, or natural occurrences. So, boiling less salt water doesn't influence the start of a forest fire. 2. The fire surrounds the vicinity - Once ignited, the area a fire surrounds depends on the fire's strength, fuel availability, and environmental conditions. Boiling less salt water does not affect these factors. 3. The animals are trapped - When a fire surrounds an area, animals might not have time to escape, and many can get trapped. Boiling less salt water won't directly influence whether animals are trapped or not. 4. Habitat destruction - A forest fire destroys the local habitat, regardless of whether less saltwater is being boiled or not. 5. Survivors find a new habitat - Animals that survive the fire will look for a new habitat; however, boiling less salt water does not play any role in this process. 6. Conflict with other animals - As survivors find and compete for a new habitat, conflicts with other animals may arise. This might be due to competition for resources, territory, or shelter. Boiling less salt water will not directly impact conflicts between animals. In summary, boiling less salt water has no direct effect on the chain of events and will not create a greater negative effect on animals, so the answer is C: no effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Some years ago a woman on our staff came into my office to, basically, tell me off and complain to me about others and about myself. This woman had not been very supportive of me in my role ever since I began working there. I couldn’t figure out if she was arrogant or lacking in self esteem. During this meeting / confrontation, she told me, in no uncertain terms, just what she didn’t like about some recent decisions I had made. I listened to her speak for about 30 minutes. She, quite methodically, tore me apart. Initially, I had planned to hear her out, make a few vague remarks, and send her on her way, thinking that maybe she just needed to be heard. But about 20 minutes into her harangue, I had a change of heart. I decided that, if she asked for a response for me, if she asked my advice, I was going to tell her exactly what I thought. She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person. She sat and looked at me, then burst into tears. I waited. Looking up, she said, “Yes, you are correct. I am a horrible person. And I am miserable. What can I do?” We spent some time discussing what she could do, and (even though I didn’t want to take the time to do it) I asked her if she would like a mentor — me?
