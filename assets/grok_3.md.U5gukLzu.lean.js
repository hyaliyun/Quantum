The suspended products, which include mango, fruit, and cucumber flavors, make up about 80% of Juul's US sales, according to CNBC. The move comes amid growing scrutiny and regulatory action against vaping companies, which some blame for a surge in youth nicotine use and an outbreak of lung disease linked to vaping. Critics argue that the company's decision is too little, too late, and that Juul and other ecigarette makers should be regulated like tobacco companies.","completion":"Juul, one of the biggest vaping companies in the United States, has announced its decision to halt the sale of several of its flavored nicotine products to combat the increasing concerns regarding teen vaping and lung injuries associated with e-cigarettes. The suspended products, which include popular flavors such as mango, fruit, and cucumber, account for around 80% of Juul's sales in the United States. This move comes in the midst of stringent regulatory actions and growing scrutiny against vaping companies by health organizations and authorities, blaming them for the alarming increase in youth nicotine use and the outbreak of lung disease linked to vaping. Some critics have raised their voices, considering Juul's decision a little too late and claiming that companies like Juul and other e-cigarette manufacturers need to be regulated like tobacco companies. According to a statement by Juul, the company acknowledges the concerns shared by health organizations and authorities regarding the use of flavored e-cigarette products by youth. Juul believes that manufacturers, like themselves, should be providing reasonable alternatives for adult smokers who want to switch to vaping. Their message is that they will work with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders to make a positive impact on public health while providing an alternative to combustible cigarettes. However, the decision made by Juul to halt sales of the flavored e-cigarette products has garnered mixed reactions among critics. Some claim that they would have taken the step sooner if they genuinely cared about public health, while others hail this as a significant and necessary step in reducing teen vaping. Despite the mixed reactions of critics, this move by Juul is historic, signaling a shift in how e-cigarette companies will proceed in the future. In conclusion, while this may have caused a big loss in sales for the company, Juul's decision to halt sales of flavored e-cigarettes in the United States could have far-reaching consequences and could signify a significant beginning to curb this epidemic."},{"prompt":"Given The weather service issued a tornado warning for the area.

The apes were seen using sticks to test the depth of muddy water and to cross swampy areas at a swamp in the Republic of the Congo. It had previously been thought that tool use among apes was confined to chimpanzees and orangutans. The behavioural study suggests that the remarkable ability may be far more widespread than was believed. The report appears in the online journal PLoS Biology. The team of investigators that made the observations describe how the gorillas examine the depth of water, and then use the sticks to probe into it, presumably to test footing. A young gorilla was also seen using a stick to âgauge the depth of a pool of water and to check mud consistency before crossing. The research is significant because it broadens the number of species known to use tools in the wild, suggesting that tool use in apes is less about brain power than originally thought. The observations suggest that the behaviour may have been inherited from a common ancestor, which the three groups split from over 10 million years ago.","completion":"- Lowland gorillas have been observed using tools in the wild for the first time - The behavioural study suggests that tool use among apes may be far more widespread than was believed - The research suggests that tool use in apes is less about brain power than originally thought - The observations suggest that the behavior may have been inherited from a common ancestor"},{"prompt":"Take the following as truth: Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India.
