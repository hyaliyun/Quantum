} \`\`\` 然后，创建一个类，命名为Task，模拟一个需要执行的任务： \`\`\`java public class Task { public void execute(Callback callback) { System.out.println(\\"Task executing...\\"); // 模拟任务执行的耗时过程 try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\\"Task executed.\\"); // 当任务执行完成后调用回调函数 callback.onFinish(); } } \`\`\` 最后，创建一个类，命名为App，作为入口类，用于演示回调函数的使用： \`\`\`java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { Task task = new Task(); // 创建一个回调函数 Callback callback = new Callback() { @Override public void onFinish() { System.out.println(\\"Callback function called.\\"); System.out.println(\\"Task finished.\\"); } }; // 执行任务，并传入回调函数 task.execute(callback); System.out.println(\\"Main thread continues to run...\\"); } } \`\`\` 在上述示例中，Task类表示一个需要执行的任务，其中的execute方法接受一个Callback接口作为参数。在execute方法中，模拟了任务的执行过程，并在任务完成后调用回调函数的onFinish方法。在App类中，创建了一个Callback接口的实现对象，作为回调函数传递给了Task对象的execute方法。 运行该示例后，可以看到如下输出结果： \`\`\` Task executing... Task executed. Callback function called. Task finished. Main thread continues to run... \`\`\` 从输出结果中可以看出，在执行任务期间，主线程不会被阻塞，而是继续执行后续的代码。当任务执行完成后，回调函数被调用，且回调函数的功能由Callback接口的实现决定。"},{"prompt":"回调函数是什么设计模式","completion":"回调函数并不是一个独立的设计模式，而是一种编程模式。它通常被用于实现其他设计模式，如观察者模式、策略模式和模板方法模式等。 回调函数的本质是通过将一个函数作为参数传递给另一个函数，使得另一个函数在特定条件下调用传递的函数，用以实现扩展和灵活性。回调函数经常应用于事件处理、异步编程和接口回调等情况。 以下是几种常见的设计模式，其中使用了回调函数： 1. 观察者模式（Observer Pattern）：观察者模式定义了一种一对多的关系，当一个对象（称为主题）的状态发生改变时，它的所有依赖对象（称为观察者）都会自动收到通知并进行相应的处理。在观察者模式中，回调函数被用作通知机制，主题对象调用观察者对象的回调函数来传递通知。 2. 策略模式（Strategy Pattern）：策略模式定义了一系列算法，并使得它们可以互相替换。在策略模式中，回调函数被用作执行具体算法的策略，上层对象通过传递回调函数给策略对象来选择具体的算法实现。 3. 模板方法模式（Template Method Pattern）：模板方法模式定义了一个算法的骨架，将一些步骤延迟到子类中实现。在模板方法模式中，回调函数被用作在算法执行过程中的具体实现，子类通过实现回调函数来自定义算法的某些步骤。 回调函数提供了一种灵活和可扩展的方式，允许将具体的实现延迟到运行时决定，并允许在运行时动态地改变行为。这种灵活性和可扩展性对于构建复杂的系统和应对变化非常有用。"},{"prompt":"supogamos que tienes la siguiente hoja de vida: Expertise: Analista, economista, experto seo para economiacripto.com, expert in Price action, Technical analysis, macroeconomics, Investment strategy, systematic trading.

Con aquellas características que tienes, Quiero que presentes tu análisis por parte del equipo de 'EconomíaCripto' de manera atractiva, amigable, objetiva, de fácil entendimiento, analiza los puntos pivote para Intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio, también puedes utilizar los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior para comentar al respecto. No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos. Luego de leer esas estrategias del PivotPoints, utiliza solo una para tu análisis o crea tu propia estrategia, no quiero que menciones el nombre de la estrategia, tampoco menciones la teoría, tampoco en que consiste.

Hoy les traigo un análisis apasionante del símbolo Ethereum. Pero antes de empezar, quiero recordarles que este análisis no es una recomendación de inversión y que cada uno debe realizar su propio análisis antes de tomar decisiones financieras. ¡Invierte solo lo que estés dispuesto a perder! Ahora, entremos en materia. Utilizando una de las estrategias más efectivas, los Puntos Pivote, podemos intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio de Ethereum. Veamos los valores clave: el Pivote se encuentra en 1874.92667, R1 en 1889.15334, R2 en 1910.78667 y R3 en 1925.01334. Por otro lado, S1 se ubica en 1853.29334, S2 en 1839.06667 y S3 en 1817.43334. Utilizando estos niveles, podemos aplicar la estrategia de soporte y resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit justo por encima de ella, acompañada de un Stop Loss. Y si el precio se mueve hacia el soporte, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit con un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerden que los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencia si el precio está por debajo de ellos, y viceversa. También podemos aplicar la estrategia de identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio rompe la resistencia, podemos abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. En cambio, si el precio rompe el soporte, podemos comenzar a vender el Ethereum, estableciendo el Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de soporte. No olvidemos colocar el Stop Loss para protegernos en caso de movimientos adversos. Los Puntos Pivote también nos ayudan a identificar la tendencia del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es señal de que hay muchos compradores y podemos considerar abrir posiciones de compra. Por el contrario, si el precio está por debajo del Punto Pivote, indicaría una tendencia bajista y podríamos considerar posiciones de venta. Recuerden también tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado. Cuando un mercado abre, existe una mayor probabilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, lo que brinda oportunidades a los traders. Por ejemplo, cuando el mercado asiático abre y el mercado estadounidense está cerrado, los precios pueden mantenerse estables entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o resistencia. En resumen, utilizando las estrategias de Puntos Pivote podemos tener una guía para nuestras operaciones con Ethereum. Recuerden siempre realizar su propio análisis y no olviden que el trading implica riesgos. ¡Buena suerte a todos!"},{"prompt":"please provide 5 articles published after 2010 with topic factors which affect the motivation for better job performance","completion":"Sure!

Following each article's summary, I will provide a comparison and critique: 1. Article 1: Explores the Impact of Motivation on Job Performance This study examines the influence of motivation on job performance using a quantitative research design. The findings suggest a positive relationship between motivation and job performance. However, the limited sample size hinders the generalizability of the results to larger populations or different contexts. 2. Article 2: Investigates the Role of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation in Job Performance This research compares the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on job performance. The findings indicate that both forms of motivation positively impact job performance. However, the study only focuses on a specific industry and does not consider other potential mediators or moderators that may influence this relationship. 3. Article 3: Examines the Influence of Motivational Factors on Employee Job Performance This article explores various motivational factors, such as rewards, recognition, and goal clarity, and their impact on job performance. The study employs a mixed-methods approach and provides valuable qualitative insights. However, the small sample size limits the generalizability of the results. 4. Article 4: Analyzes the Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction in the Motivation-Job Performance Relationship This research investigates the mediating role of job satisfaction in the relationship between motivation and job performance. The findings reveal that job satisfaction partially mediates this relationship. However, the cross-sectional design used in this study limits the ability to establish causality or consider potential reverse causality. 5. Article 5: Explores the Moderating Effect of Leadership Style on the Motivation-Job Performance Link This study examines how different leadership styles, such as transformational and transactional leadership, moderate the relationship between motivation and job performance. The findings indicate that leadership style influences the strength of this relationship. However, the study relies on self-report measures, which may introduce bias and limit the objectivity of the results. In summary, while these articles all explore the relationship between motivation and job performance, they differ in terms of research methodology, sample size, and specific focus. Some limitations include small sample sizes, restricted generalizability, and reliance on self-report measures.

Las escalas menores melódicas tienen armadura de clave?","completion":"Sí, las escalas menores melódicas pueden tener armadura de clave. En la música tonal occidental, las escalas menores melódicas suelen tener una armadura de clave para indicar los cambios en las alteraciones de las notas en comparación con la escala menor natural. Por ejemplo, la escala de La menor melódica ascendente (A - B - C - D - E - F# - G# - A) tendría una armadura de clave de tres sostenidos para indicar los cambios en las notas F, G y A en comparación con la escala menor natural (A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A).

Es importante tener en cuenta que las escalas menores melódicas pueden variar dependiendo del contexto musical y la tradición específica de la música que se esté estudiando."},{"prompt":"Qué es la tonalidad en música?","completion":"La tonalidad en música se refiere al concepto fundamental de organizar y estructurar las notas dentro de una pieza musical alrededor de un tono central, llamado tónica. En la tonalidad, hay una jerarquía de notas y acordes que se basan en la relación con esta tónica. En la música occidental, la tonalidad más común es la tonalidad mayor y la tonalidad menor. En la tonalidad mayor, la tónica se considera la nota fundamental y proporciona un sentido de estabilidad y resolución, mientras que en la tonalidad menor, la tónica también desempeña un papel central, pero con una cualidad más melancólica. La tonalidad se establece mediante el uso de armaduras de clave que indican las alteraciones de las notas en una pieza musical. Por ejemplo, la armadura de clave de la tonalidad de do mayor no tiene alteraciones, mientras que la armadura de clave de la tonalidad de mi menor tiene una alteración (la nota fá), indicando que la escala de mi menor se basa en esta alteración. La tonalidad es un elemento clave en la música occidental, ya que influye en la armonía, la melodía, la progresión de acordes y la estructura formal de una pieza musical, creando una sensación de coherencia y dirección musical."},{"prompt":"la tonalidad coincide con la escala?","completion":"Sí, la tonalidad está estrechamente relacionada con la escala. En la música tonal occidental, la tonalidad se establece en torno a una escala específica, ya sea mayor o menor. En una tonalidad mayor, la escala mayor correspondiente se convierte en la base tonal, y las notas y acordes utilizados en la composición estarán principalmente extraídos de esa escala. Por ejemplo, si estamos en la tonalidad de do mayor, la escala de do mayor (do - re - mi - fa - sol - la - si - do) será la base tonal. De manera similar, en una tonalidad menor, la escala menor correspondiente se convierte en la base tonal. Por ejemplo, si estamos en la tonalidad de la menor, la escala de la menor (la - si - do - re - mi - fa - sol - la) será la base tonal. Sin embargo, cabe destacar que la tonalidad y la escala no son exactamente lo mismo. La tonalidad se refiere al sistema tonal general dentro del cual se encuentra una composición, mientras que la escala es una secuencia ordenada de notas que forman la base de esa tonalidad. La escala es un componente fundamental de la tonalidad, pero la tonalidad abarca otros aspectos como la armonía, la melodía y la progresión de acordes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos.

Hoy les traigo un análisis trading para Litecoin con el fin de ayudarles a tomar decisiones informadas en sus inversiones. Como experto en análisis técnico y fundamental, les mostraré una estrategia amigable y fácil de entender. Según los datos proporcionados, los puntos pivote para Litecoin son: Pivote: 95.35, R1: 97.2, R2: 99.18, R3: 101.03, S1: 93.37, S2: 91.52, S3: 89.54. Utilizando la estrategia de soporte y resistencia, podemos identificar niveles clave para operar. Si el precio se mueve hacia la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente de venta cerca de ella, con un stop loss justo por encima. Del mismo modo, si el precio se acerca al soporte, podemos establecer una orden pendiente de compra con un stop loss por debajo. Recuerden que los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencia si el precio cae por debajo y viceversa. También podemos utilizar los puntos pivote para determinar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, es una señal alcista y podríamos considerar abrir posiciones de compra. Por otro lado, si el precio cae por debajo del punto pivote, indicaría una tendencia bajista y podríamos considerar posiciones de venta. Es importante tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado, ya que pueden influir en los movimientos de precios. Durante la apertura de una sesión, como en Estados Unidos, existe la posibilidad de romper los niveles pivote debido a la entrada masiva de traders. Asimismo, cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el asiático abre, los precios pueden mantenerse estables entre el punto pivote y los niveles de soporte o resistencia, brindando oportunidades para operar en rangos. Ahora, con respecto a Litecoin, es necesario destacar que este análisis no constituye una recomendación de inversión. Cada lector debe realizar su propio análisis y solo invertir lo que esté dispuesto a perder. ¡Sigue atentamente nuestros análisis para obtener más información sobre el emocionante mundo del trading de criptomonedas!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Como posso ajudar você hoje?"},{"prompt":"eu preciso de um computador com uma boa configuração de áudio. Eu quero montar um super estúdio de gravação. Eu sou músico.","completion":"Isso é ótimo! Um estúdio de gravação requer um computador com recursos avançados de áudio para garantir a melhor qualidade possível. Aqui estão algumas especificações que recomendo procurar ao montar seu computador para um estúdio de gravação: 1. Processador: Procure um processador potente, como um Intel Core i7 ou i9, que seja rápido o suficiente para lidar com tarefas de processamento de áudio em tempo real. 2. Memória RAM: Quanto mais RAM, melhor. Recomendo pelo menos 8 GB, mas se puder ter 16 GB ou mais, será ainda melhor para executar vários programas de gravação ou plugins de áudio simultaneamente. 3. Disco rígido: Opte por um SSD (Solid State Drive) para o sistema operacional e programas, pois isso garantirá tempos de carregamento mais rápidos. Para armazenamento de dados, escolha um disco rígido convencional para maior capacidade. 4. Placa de som: Invista em uma placa de som de qualidade, preferencialmente uma interface de áudio externa. Escolha uma que ofereça várias entradas e saídas para conectar seus instrumentos e equipamentos de gravação. 5. Placa de vídeo: Embora não seja o componente principal para um estúdio de gravação, uma placa de vídeo decente pode ajudar no desempenho geral do computador e garantir a renderização suave de interfaces e plugins de áudio. 6. Sistema operacional: Tanto o macOS quanto o Windows são boas opções, mas o macOS é frequentemente a escolha preferida pelos músicos devido à sua estabilidade e suporte para muitos softwares de áudio. 7. Software de gravação: Além do hardware, certifique-se de investir em um bom software de gravação, como Pro Tools, Logic Pro X ou Ableton Live. Esses programas têm recursos avançados e são amplamente utilizados na indústria musical. Certifique-se de pesquisar e comparar diferentes marcas e modelos para encontrar o hardware que melhor se adapte às suas necessidades e orçamento. Espero que isso o ajude a montar seu super estúdio de gravação!"},{"prompt":"eu preciso de um computador que não tenha uma alta latência midi","completion":"Para minimizar a latência MIDI em seu computador, você pode considerar algumas especificações e configurações específicas: 1. Processador: Procure um processador com alto desempenho, como um Intel Core i7 ou i9, ou um processador AMD equivalente. Isso garantirá que o computador tenha potência suficiente para lidar com o processamento de sinais MIDI em tempo real. 2. Memória RAM: Mais uma vez, quanto mais RAM, melhor. Recomenda-se ter pelo menos 8 GB, mas se possível, opte por 16 GB ou mais. Isso permitirá uma execução mais suave e eficiente de programas de gravação e softwares de edição de áudio. 3. Interface de áudio: É importante ter uma interface de áudio de baixa latência. Procure por interfaces que ofereçam entradas e saídas dedicadas para MIDI, bem como recursos avançados de latência mínima. Considere marcas conhecidas como Focusrite, PreSonus, Universal Audio ou Apogee. 4. Drivers de áudio: Certifique-se de instalar os drivers mais recentes e atualizados para sua interface de áudio. Drivers atualizados geralmente trazem melhorias de desempenho, suporte a baixa latência e correções de bugs. 5. Buffer size (tamanho do buffer): Ajustar o tamanho do buffer em suas configurações de áudio pode ajudar a reduzir a latência. Definir um tamanho menor do buffer pode reduzir a latência, mas também pode colocar mais carga no processador. É uma questão de encontrar um equilíbrio entre latência e desempenho. 6. Latência do sistema operacional: Alguns sistemas operacionais podem ter uma latência inerente maior do que outros. O macOS, por exemplo, tem uma reputação de menor latência em comparação com o Windows. Portanto, se a latência MIDI for uma preocupação importante, talvez seja preferível usar o macOS. Levar em consideração todas essas especificações e ajustes pode ajudar a minimizar a latência MIDI em seu computador e permitir uma melhor experiência de gravação e produção musical."},{"prompt":"no item 2: o meu note suporte até 8 gb. Term como extender?","completion":"Se o seu computador suporta apenas 8 GB de RAM, há algumas opções para expandir essa capacidade: 1. Verifique se há slots de memória RAM adicionais: Alguns laptops possuem slots de memória RAM adicionais que permitem aumentar a capacidade total de RAM. Verifique no manual do seu laptop ou consulte o suporte do fabricante para confirmar se há slots disponíveis para expansão. 2. Atualize a memória RAM existente: Se o seu laptop já possui 4 GB de RAM, por exemplo, é possível substituir o módulo de 4 GB por um módulo de 8 GB, alcançando um total de 8 GB de RAM. Consulte o manual ou o suporte do fabricante para obter informações sobre a compatibilidade dos módulos de memória RAM e a capacidade máxima suportada. 3. Use tecnologia ReadyBoost (somente para Windows): O Windows possui uma função chamada ReadyBoost que permite usar um dispositivo de armazenamento USB como memória adicional. Embora não seja tão eficiente quanto aumentar fisicamente a RAM, pode proporcionar um aumento de desempenho marginal.

No entanto, essa opção normalmente está disponível apenas em alguns notebooks específicos, como os Chromebooks, que suportam o uso de cartões SD ou armazenamento externo como uma opção de expansão. Para estender a memória RAM usando dispositivos externos, você precisará de um dispositivo de armazenamento removível, como um cartão SD ou um disco rígido externo, que seja compatível com o seu notebook. É importante verificar as especificações e a compatibilidade do seu notebook antes de prosseguir. Em laptops que suportam essa opção, você pode inserir um cartão SD em um slot disponível ou conectar um disco rígido externo ao seu notebook. Em seguida, você pode configurar o sistema operacional para usar o armazenamento externo como uma expansão da memória RAM usando recursos como ReadyBoost no Windows. No entanto, é importante notar que essa opção de expansão usando armazenamento externo como memória RAM é menos eficiente em comparação com a instalação física de módulos de memória adicionais. A velocidade e a capacidade de resposta podem não ser tão boas quanto a expansão interna da memória RAM. Portanto, se a capacidade de memória RAM do seu notebook é limitada e você precisa de um desempenho além da capacidade do hardware existente, pode ser necessário considerar a atualização física do próprio notebook ou a busca por um notebook com maior capacidade de memória RAM.

Hoy les traigo un análisis muy interesante sobre el comportamiento del mercado de la criptomoneda Solana. Como experto en trading y economista especializado en criptomonedas, les brindaré una estrategia de trading que les ayudará a tomar decisiones informadas en este emocionante mercado. Utilizando la estrategia de soporte y resistencia, podemos identificar los puntos pivote clave para intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio de Solana. Observando los datos del día anterior, vemos que el precio de cierre fue de 21.55, ligeramente por debajo del punto pivote de 21.66333. Esto indica que existe una tendencia bajista en el corto plazo. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de resistencia R1 en 22.10666, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Por otro lado, si el precio se acerca al nivel de soporte S1 en 21.10666, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop Loss por debajo del soporte. Es importante recordar que los niveles de soporte y resistencia pueden cambiar su función según la dirección del precio. También debemos tener en cuenta que la tendencia general del mercado de Solana puede ser un factor importante en nuestras decisiones de trading. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y podría ser un buen momento para comprar. Por el contrario, si el precio se mantiene por debajo del punto pivote, indica un sentimiento bajista y deberíamos considerar estrategias de venta. Por último, es esencial tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado y su impacto en los niveles de pivote. Cuando uno de los mercados principales abre, como el de Estados Unidos, puede haber movimientos significativos en los niveles de pivote debido a la entrada masiva de traders. Por otro lado, cuando el mercado asiático abre mientras el estadounidense está cerrado, es posible que se mantengan niveles estables entre el punto pivote y el soporte o resistencia.

Hoy les presento mi análisis exclusivo para el equipo de EconomíaCripto, de manera atractiva, amigable y objetiva. Utilizando mi experiencia de 16 años en trading forex y 13 años en trading de criptomonedas, así como mis amplios conocimientos en análisis técnico y fundamental, estrategias de inversión y trading sistemático, les daré una visión clara de hacia dónde podría dirigirse el precio de XRP. Vamos a utilizar la estrategia de soporte y resistencia como base para nuestro análisis. Los niveles de Pivote actúan como puntos de referencia clave, donde los traders pueden colocar órdenes de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y órdenes de venta cerca de la resistencia. En nuestro caso, el precio actual de XRP está ligeramente por debajo del Punto Pivote en 0.46967. Si el precio se mueve hacia la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit justo por encima de 0.47534 y un Stop Loss para proteger nuestras ganancias. Por otro lado, si el precio se dirige hacia el soporte, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit justo por debajo de 0.46274 y un Stop Loss para limitar las pérdidas. También es importante considerar los niveles clave para un posible rompimiento. Si observamos una fuerte tendencia alcista, podemos esperar a que XRP rompa la resistencia en 0.47534. En ese punto, abriríamos una posición de compra y estableceríamos un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia en 0.48227. Por supuesto, siempre debemos estar atentos a un posible movimiento contrario y establecer un Stop Loss ligeramente por debajo de la primera resistencia. En cuanto a la tendencia general del mercado, si el precio de XRP rompiera hacia arriba el Punto Pivote en 0.46967, sería una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y podríamos comenzar a comprar el par. Por otro lado, si el precio cae por debajo del Punto Pivote, indicaría un sentimiento bajista y deberíamos considerar estrategias de venta. También es importante tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado. En este momento, el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático está abierto. Esto podría mantener los precios estables entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia, lo que brinda oportunidades para operar en rangos. Recuerden, esta información no constituye una recomendación de inversión. Los usuarios deben realizar su propio análisis y solo invertir lo que estén dispuestos a perder. ¡Adelante, entusiastas de las criptomonedas, y pongan a prueba su estrategia de trading con XRP! Pero siempre con cautela y diligencia. *Este análisis es una pieza humorística y sensacionalista y no debe ser considerado como asesoramiento financiero. Los usuarios deben investigar y tomar decisiones basadas en su propio análisis y riesgo financiero.*"},{"prompt":"supogamos que tienes la siguiente hoja de vida: Expertise: Analista, economista, experto seo para economiacripto.com, expert in Price action, Technical analysis, macroeconomics, Investment strategy, systematic trading.

Vamos a sumergirnos directamente en una estrategia clave que utiliza los Puntos Pivote para identificar niveles de soporte y resistencia. Con un Punto Pivote en 244.98, podemos anticipar que si el precio se dirige hacia la resistencia, podría ser una señal para colocar una orden pendiente de venta cerca de la resistencia en 248.06, con un Stop Loss justo por encima de ella.

Recuerden, los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencia si el precio está por debajo de ellos, y viceversa. Además, observemos los indicadores clave del día anterior, como el alto, el cierre y el bajo. Estos números proporcionan información valiosa para nuestros análisis. Ahora, no quiero aburrirlos con explicaciones repetitivas, pero les garantizo que estos indicadores son cruciales para comprender las tendencias de precios. Al utilizar esta estrategia, es importante tener en cuenta los posibles escenarios. Si el precio rompe la resistencia en 248.06, podemos considerar abrir una posición de compra y establecer un objetivo de ganancia en el siguiente nivel de resistencia en 252.96. Sin embargo, seamos conscientes del Stop Loss, que debemos colocar por encima de la resistencia. Por otro lado, si el precio rompe el soporte en 240.08, podemos comenzar a considerar una posición de venta y establecer el objetivo de ganancia en el siguiente nivel de soporte en 237.0.

No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte.

Hoy traigo para ustedes un análisis de trading que los dejará boquiabiertos. Pero antes que nada, permítanme recordarles que esto no es una recomendación de inversión, solo quiero compartir con ustedes algunas ideas y estrategias interesantes. Hablemos de puntos pivote, esos niveles mágicos que pueden indicarnos hacia dónde podría dirigirse el precio de EOS. Y aquí está el punto pivote clave: 0.7185. Ahora, según la estrategia de soporte y resistencia, si el precio se mueve hacia la resistencia en 0.7315, podríamos considerar una orden pendiente Sell Limit con un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Por otro lado, si el precio cae hacia el soporte en 0.6989, podríamos pensar en una orden pendiente Buy Limit con un Stop Loss por debajo del soporte. Otra estrategia interesante es la de los niveles clave. Si vemos una fuerte tendencia alcista y el precio rompe la resistencia en 0.7315, podríamos abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia en 0.7511. Por supuesto, no olviden ajustar su Stop Loss por debajo de la primera resistencia. Pero cuidado, siempre estén atentos a posibles rompimientos falsos, especialmente durante eventos importantes. Los puntos pivote también nos pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, podría ser una señal de que los compradores están dominando, mientras que un precio por debajo del punto pivote podría indicar que los vendedores están tomando el control. Por último, recuerden las sesiones de mercado. Cuando uno de los mercados abre, como el de Estados Unidos, puede haber una mayor posibilidad de romper los niveles de pivote. ¡Esas son oportunidades que no podemos dejar pasar! Ahora, a riesgo de sonar repetitivo, les pido encarecidamente que realicen su propio análisis y tomen sus decisiones de inversión con precaución.

Hoy vamos a analizar el posible movimiento del precio de Tezos utilizando una estrategia de trading basada en los Puntos Pivote. Pero antes que nada, quiero recordarles que este análisis no es una recomendación de inversión. Recuerden siempre realizar su propio análisis y solo invertir lo que estén dispuestos a perder. Siguiendo nuestra estrategia, notamos que el precio de Tezos ha estado fluctuando cerca del nivel de resistencia R1, el cual está aproximadamente en 0.83154. Si el precio logra romper este nivel, podríamos considerar abrir una posición de compra con un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia R2, que se encuentra alrededor de 0.85017. Sin embargo, debemos colocar un Stop Loss justo por debajo del nivel de resistencia R1 para limitar nuestras pérdidas en caso de un movimiento contrario. Por otro lado, si el precio cae por debajo del nivel de soporte S1, que está alrededor de 0.80154, podríamos considerar abrir una posición de venta con un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de soporte S2, situado aproximadamente en 0.79017. Es importante establecer un Stop Loss por encima del nivel de soporte S1 para protegernos en caso de un posible rebote. Tenemos que tener en cuenta que los niveles de soporte y resistencia pueden cambiar, especialmente durante eventos importantes en el mercado. Por eso, siempre es recomendable estar al tanto de las últimas noticias y del calendario económico para tener una visión más clara de la situación. En resumen, basándonos en los Puntos Pivote, consideramos dos posibles escenarios para el precio de Tezos. El primero es una posible ruptura alcista hacia el nivel de resistencia R2, donde podríamos abrir una posición de compra. El segundo escenario sería una caída del precio por debajo del nivel de soporte S1, donde podríamos considerar abrir una posición de venta. Recuerden que el trading implica riesgos, por lo que es importante utilizar estrategias sólidas y gestionar adecuadamente el riesgo. ¡Buena suerte en sus operaciones!

To predict breast cancer, the coded data of 14 SNPs from 280 enrolled subjects were randomly shuffled, with 80% of the data classified as training and the remaining 20% as test group to validate. Single factor analysis was performed to screen independent risk factors, and then Breast Cancer with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms - Machine Learning model (BCSNP-ML) prediction model was completed using Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm. Single factor analysis showed that SULT1A1 rs1042028, CYP1A1 rs1048943, CYP1B1 rs1056827 and CYP1A1 rs1056836 were significantly associated with the occurrence of breast cancer. The highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the six machine learning models established on 14 variables was 0.809. The AUROC of the BCSNP-ML model constructed by four variables was 0.831. Otherwise, BCSNP-ML is visualized and explained in the paper using SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis to further validate that the model can be used as a powerful tool for clinical prediction of breast cancer.","completion":"This paper presents a novel noninvasive breast cancer prediction model using machine learning algorithms and estrogen metabolic enzyme gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Strap in because I have an absolutely wild story to share with you all. Prepare to be amazed as I recount my incredible experience of being raised by tigers. Yes, you read that right – tigers! So, picture this: it's the late 1980s, and I was just a small, helpless baby abandoned in the dense jungles of Southeast Asia. But fate had something extraordinary in store for me. As luck would have it, a family of tigers stumbled upon me and decided to take me under their paw. And thus began my extraordinary upbringing as a true tiger cub. Now, I know what you're thinking – \\"How on earth did you survive?\\" And believe me, I'm just as astounded as you are. The tigers somehow accepted me as one of their own, treating me with affection and tenderness. They taught me the ways of the jungle, from hunting techniques to navigating through the wild with agility and stealth. I grew up alongside my striped siblings, engaging in playful wrestling matches with them, emulating their instinctive behavior, and even joining in on the occasional jungle feast. While it may sound fearsome, I never once felt threatened. These majestic creatures were my family, my protectors, and my companions. Living in harmony with nature, I developed a deep understanding of the jungle ecosystem, discovering hidden waterfalls, secret caves, and the symphony of sounds that echoed through the wilderness. It was an existence that words simply cannot capture, a bond with nature that transcended my wildest dreams. However, as I approached my teenage years, reality began to sink in. I knew I had to reintegrate into human society. Reluctantly leaving my beloved tiger family behind, I embarked on a journey to rediscover my own kind and reclaim my human identity. My story continues as I adapt to the human world, navigating through its complexities, and trying to merge my unique experiences with the expectations of modern society. The transition has been challenging, but the lifelong lessons from my time with the tigers have molded me into a person with resilience, courage, and an appreciation for the untamed beauty that exists in this world. So there you have it, dear Redditors – my utterly unbelievable tale of being raised by tigers. It may sound like something out of a storybook, but I assure you, it's an experience that has shaped me in profound ways. Feel free to ask me anything about my extraordinary upbringing! TL;DR: Abandoned as a baby, I was raised by tigers in the jungles of Southeast Asia. My journey with them was an extraordinary adventure, shaping me into the person I am today.

Aquí te explico cómo reconocer si una canción está en tonalidad mayor o menor. La tonalidad mayor y menor se refieren a dos escalas diferentes que se utilizan en la música. La escala mayor tiene un sonido más alegre y brillante, mientras que la escala menor tiene un tono más melancólico y oscuro. Para determinar si una canción está en tonalidad mayor o menor, hay algunos puntos clave a tener en cuenta: 1. La clave: verifica la clave de la canción. La clave es un símbolo al comienzo del pentagrama que indica la posición de las notas musicales. En la música occidental, la clave más comúnmente utilizada es la clave de sol. Dentro de la clave de sol, si el último sostenido es F#, es muy probable que estemos en una tonalidad mayor, mientras que si el último bemol es Bb, es más probable que estemos en una tonalidad menor. 2. La tónica: observa la nota principal o \\"tónica\\" de la canción. La tónica es la nota a la que la mayoría de las frases melódicas y acordes de la canción tienden a resolver. En la tonalidad mayor, la tónica suele ser la primera nota de la escala mayor (por ejemplo, Do en la escala de Do mayor). En la tonalidad menor, la tónica suele ser la sexta nota de la escala mayor (por ejemplo, La en la escala de Do menor). 3. Los acordes: analiza los acordes utilizados en la canción. En la tonalidad mayor, los acordes más comunes son el acorde I (tónico), IV (subdominante) y V (dominante). En la tonalidad menor, los acordes más comunes son el acorde VI (submediante), III (mediante) y V (dominante). Observa qué acordes se utilizan con mayor frecuencia y cuál parece ser el acorde más resolutivo. 4. El sonido general: por último, utiliza tu oído para determinar si la canción tiene un sonido mayor o menor. La tonalidad mayor tiende a tener un sonido más alegre y luminoso, mientras que la tonalidad menor puede tener un tono más triste y oscuro. Presta atención a la melodía y las emociones que te transmite la canción. Recuerda que estos son solo algunos puntos clave para determinar si una canción está en tonalidad mayor o menor. Puede haber excepciones y variaciones, pero en general, estos consejos te ayudarán a identificar la tonalidad predominante de una canción. ¡Espero que esto te sea útil!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When all three are used"},{"prompt":"A common joke about plants is that if an extraterrestrial plant species were to land on Earth, mint would 100% attempt to cross-breed with it. What is the basis of this joke?","completion":"The basis of this joke lies in the invasive and hardy nature of the mint plant. Mint is known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread rapidly, often overtaking other plants in its vicinity. It has a tendency to send out runners, or underground stems, which can easily take root and produce new plants. This characteristic makes mint a notorious cross-breeder, as it readily hybridizes with other mint species if they are planted nearby. By joking that mint would \\"100% attempt to cross-breed\\" with an extraterrestrial plant species, the joke highlights the plant's overwhelming reproductive capability and insinuates that it would not hesitate to mate with anything even remotely resembling a plant. It plays on the comical idea of mint's aggressive nature and its eagerness to mix its genes with any potential plant partner, including imaginary extraterrestrial species."},{"prompt":"What about the meme where plants would undergo millions of years of evolution to produce chemicals harmful or toxic to other animals, only for humans to enjoy those chemicals such as capsaicin, menthol and caffeine, to the point that they cultivate plants to produce MORE of the chemicals? In addition to the memes, some would also add that the plants win in the end because their genes are spread throughout the planet instead of by animals spreading it.","completion":"The meme you mentioned is a humorous take on the relationship between plants and humans, highlighting the irony that plants have evolved to produce chemicals that are initially meant to deter or harm animals, but humans have found ways to enjoy and even cultivate those chemicals for their own purposes. Plants produce various chemicals, such as capsaicin (found in chili peppers), menthol (found in mint), and caffeine (found in coffee and tea), as a defense mechanism against herbivores. These chemicals can cause discomfort, irritation, or even toxicity in animals, serving as a deterrent to prevent them from consuming the plants. However, humans have developed a taste for some of these chemicals and have found ways to exploit their properties for culinary, medicinal, or recreational purposes. For example, capsaicin provides the spicy flavor in many cuisines, menthol is used in various products like toothpaste and cough drops, and caffeine is a widely consumed stimulant. The meme humorously suggests that despite plants evolving these chemicals to repel animals, humans have managed to turn the tables by cultivating plants that produce more of these desirable chemicals. It playfully implies that plants have inadvertently \\"lost\\" in their evolutionary battle against animals, as humans actively propagate and spread their genes through cultivation, while animals unintentionally aid in plant reproduction through pollination and seed dispersal. Overall, the meme highlights the intricate and often symbiotic relationship between plants and humans, showcasing the unexpected ways in which humans have interacted with and benefited from the chemical defenses that plants have evolved over millions of years."},{"prompt":"How about memes about Vikings where it suggests that people shouldn't be surprised if they land on a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy and find a Viking longship there?","completion":"The memes you mentioned play on the popular cultural image of Vikings as adventurous and fearless explorers. They humorously suggest that Vikings were so intrepid and adventurous that they would not hesitate to travel to distant galaxies and discover Viking longships even in the Andromeda Galaxy. The joke relies on the juxtaposition of the historical Vikings, who were known for their seafaring expeditions and exploration, with the concept of space travel and extraterrestrial encounters. By suggesting that Vikings would be capable of landing on a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy and finding a Viking longship there, the memes playfully exaggerate the Viking's reputation for exploration and conquest. The humor lies in the absurdity and unexpectedness of the idea. Vikings are associated with their historical presence in areas such as Scandinavia and parts of Europe, so the notion of finding their iconic longships in a completely different galaxy adds an element of surprise and amusement. These memes often serve as a lighthearted way to celebrate the adventurous spirit and cultural impact of the Vikings, while also poking fun at the idea of their exploration extending far beyond what history tells us."},{"prompt":"What about memes of countries, such as: \\"Algeria screaming in terror when the French come back\\", \\"Austria choosing between classical musician or war criminal\\", \\"Belgium celebrating over the world forgetting about their human rights abuse\\", \\"A peaceful neighborhood in Brazil, only to feature a scene from World War 1\\", and \\"Being raided by law enforcement because you celebrated Christmas in Brunei\\"?","completion":"The memes you mentioned are examples of dark humor or satire, which often rely on exaggeration, stereotypes, or controversial topics for comedic effect. They take a humorous approach by making exaggerated or ironic statements about certain countries or their historical events, playing on stereotypes or controversial aspects. It's important to note that humor is subjective, and while some individuals may find these memes amusing, others may find them offensive or insensitive. These memes often employ hyperbole and irony to create a comedic effect, highlighting the absurdity or unexpectedness of the situations depicted. They may play on historical events, cultural stereotypes, or controversial topics to generate humor. However, it's crucial to approach such humor with sensitivity and recognize that it may not be suitable for all audiences or contexts. It's important to remember that memes should be taken with a grain of salt and not be seen as accurate representations of reality or the beliefs of an entire country or its people. They are often created for entertainment purposes and should be understood within the context of humor and satire."},{"prompt":"This time, based on fictional media, specifically anything from Star Wars, memes can summarize the prequels as \\"Anakin Skywalker violates the Geneva convention to defeat the Separatists with Obi-Wan Kenobi watching in horror or begrudgingly joining him, Anakin's Padawan Ahsoka Tano joining Anakin's war crimes, followed by both a Republic victory, and Palpatine having to pretend he sometimes loses to the Separatists in front of the Jedi even though he controls both sides of the Clone Wars to ensure he will always win.\\"","completion":"The meme you described humorously summarizes certain aspects of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, specifically focusing on Anakin Skywalker's actions, Ahsoka Tano's involvement, the Republic's victory, and Palpatine's manipulation. It highlights the dark and morally ambiguous elements of the story in a satirical manner. The first part of the meme suggests that Anakin Skywalker, the protagonist of the prequels, resorts to extreme measures, potentially violating the Geneva Convention (which outlines rules for humanitarian treatment during warfare) in order to defeat the Separatists. It humorously portrays Obi-Wan Kenobi's reaction as one of horror or reluctant participation in these actions. The second part of the meme mentions Anakin's Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, joining him in what is humorously referred to as \\"war crimes.\\" This references the storyline where Ahsoka becomes involved in the Clone Wars conflict and the morally gray decisions she makes alongside Anakin. The meme then mentions the Republic's victory, which is a significant event in the prequel trilogy as it marks the end of the Clone Wars. Lastly, the meme touches on the manipulative nature of Palpatine, who is secretly orchestrating the events of the Clone Wars from behind the scenes. It suggests that Palpatine pretends to occasionally lose battles to the Separatists in front of the Jedi, even though he controls both sides of the conflict, ensuring his ultimate victory. Overall, the meme humorously highlights the dark and complex themes of the Star Wars prequels, focusing on the morally questionable actions of the characters and the manipulations taking place throughout the story."},{"prompt":"How about memes about taboo topics where if anyone decides to make one about incest, one answer can be \\"Ancient Egypt, Alabama or Japan?\\"?","completion":"It's important to approach sensitive topics with care and respect, as they can easily offend or upset others. Incest is a highly sensitive and taboo subject in many cultures, and making jokes or memes about it can be highly inappropriate and offensive. The example you provided attempts to make a joke by associating incest with certain regions or cultures. However, it's crucial to recognize that this kind of humor can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce negative perceptions about particular places or people. It's always advisable to consider the potential impact of jokes or memes before sharing them. It's best to avoid making light of sensitive topics like incest or any other subject that can cause distress or harm to individuals or communities.

Premium）是指由于投资者的风险偏好或市场因素等原因，某个资本资产的价格高于其内在价值的情况。简而言之，资本溢价是指某个资产的市场价格高于其在理论上或实际上的价值。 资本溢价可能是由于市场供求关系的影响，当某个资产市场需求高于供应时，其价格可能会出现溢价。资本溢价还可能受到投资者对某个特定资产的情感因素、投机活动、市场噪音等非理性因素的影响。 资本溢价可以表现为股票价格高于公司内在价值，房地产价格高于市场价值等情况。在这种情况下，投资者购买这些资本资产可能面临较高的风险，因为买入的价格已经超过其内在价值，如果市场出现调整或者投资者情绪发生变化，价格可能会下跌。

Gmod supports Lua for scripting, but you can also use Python to interact with the Lua API. To get started with Python scripting in Gmod, you need to install the python module 'gmod' using pip: \`\`\` pip install gmod \`\`\` Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can use Python with Gmod: \`\`\`python import gmod @gmod.eventlist(\\"MyAddon\\") def my_addon(): gmod.chatPrint(\\"Hello from Python in Gmod!\\") gmod.log(\\"Log entry from Python in Gmod!\\") my_addon() \`\`\` In Gmod, you first need to create a file 'python/gmod.py' and place the Python code there. Then in your 'lua/autorun/server/init.lua' file, add the following line to include and run the Python code: \`\`\`lua include(\\"python/gmod.py\\") \`\`\` After setting up the files, start Gmod and it should execute the Python code, printing \\"Hello from Python in Gmod!\\" in the chat and logging \\"Log entry from Python in Gmod!\\". Using the 'gmod' module, you can interact with various aspects of Gmod, such as players, entities, hooks, and more. The module provides functions and classes to enable communication between Lua and Python in Gmod.

Write code for him, and the container he arrives in.","completion":"Writing code for a fully functional AI android like the one depicted in the movie \\"Bicentennial Man\\" is beyond the capabilities of a simple response. It would require extensive programming, machine learning, and robotics knowledge, as well as access to appropriate hardware and software frameworks. However, I can provide you with a basic example of how to simulate the android and the container it arrives in using Python. Bear in mind that this example is a simplified simulation and not a fully functioning AI or robotics system. Here's a Python code snippet: \`\`\`python class Android: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name self.is_awake = False def wake_up(self): self.is_awake = True print(f\\"{self.name} is now awake.\\") def sleep(self): self.is_awake = False print(f\\"{self.name} is now sleeping.\\") class Container: def __init__(self, android): self.android = android def open(self): self.android.wake_up() print(\\"The container is opened.\\") def close(self): self.android.sleep() print(\\"The container is closed.\\") # Usage android = Android(\\"Android\\") container = Container(android) container.open() container.close() \`\`\` In this example, we have two classes: \`Android\` and \`Container\`. The \`Android\` class represents the android and has methods to wake up and sleep. The \`Container\` class represents the container and has methods to open and close the container, which wakes up or puts the android to sleep respectively. Running this code will simulate the android waking up when the container is opened and sleeping when the container is closed. Please note that this code is purely illustrative and does not include any advanced AI or robotic capabilities. It's important to understand that creating a fully functional android with advanced AI and interaction capabilities requires a much more complex and specialized development effort."},{"prompt":"I meant for gmos","completion":"I apologize for the misunderstanding.

These processes generally require sophisticated laboratory techniques and expertise in genetic engineering, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. If you're specifically looking for information or guidance regarding genetic modification, I recommend consulting scientific literature, speaking with experts in the field, or reaching out to academic research institutions that specialize in genetic engineering and GMO research. These resources will be better equipped to provide the necessary information and guidance."},{"prompt":"I meant gmod","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. If you're referring to Garry's Mod (Gmod), a sandbox game utilizing the Source engine, you can write Lua code to create custom content, modify game behavior, and add functionality to the game. Here's a simple example of Lua code for Gmod: \`\`\`lua if SERVER then util.AddNetworkString(\\"GmodChatMessage\\") hook.Add(\\"PlayerSay\\", \\"GmodChatCommand\\", function(ply, text, teamChat) if text == \\"!hello\\" then net.Start(\\"GmodChatMessage\\") net.WriteString(\\"Hello, \\" .. ply:Nick() .. \\"!\\") net.Send(ply) return \\"\\" end end) else net.Receive(\\"GmodChatMessage\\", function() local message = net.ReadString() chat.AddText(Color(255, 255, 0), \\"[Gmod]: \\", Color(255, 255, 255), message) end) end \`\`\` In this example, we create a simple chat command in Gmod. When a player types \\"!hello\\" into the chat, a message is sent back to them saying \\"Hello, [player name]!\\". The message is displayed in yellow color using the \`chat.AddText\` function. To use this code, create a new Lua file (e.g., \`myaddon.lua\`) in the \`lua/autorun/server/\` or \`lua/autorun/client/\` directory of your Gmod installation. Copy and paste the code into the file. When you launch Gmod, the code should execute, and the chat command will be available. Keep in mind that Gmod supports a wide range of Lua functions and features for creating custom gameplay mechanics, adding entities, manipulating physics, and more. Exploring the available Lua API documentation and Gmod modding resources can provide you with an in-depth understanding of the possibilities and help you create more advanced functionality in the game."},{"prompt":"nilai batas dosis seluruh tubuh untuk pekerja radiasi adalah 50msv (500mRem per tahun). jika kita menemukan hasil pembacaan dosis radiasi 3 bulan terakhir 25msv bagaimana","completion":"Total dosis radiasi untuk 3 bulan terakhir adalah 25 mSv.

Ancient Egyptian royalty: In ancient Egypt, there were instances of sibling marriage, particularly among the ruling families. Pharaohs sometimes married their sisters to maintain the purity of their bloodline and their claim to the throne. Consequently, incestuous relationships are often humorously attributed to Ancient Egyptian royalty in popular culture. House of Habsburgs: The House of Habsburgs was a major European noble family that ruled numerous territories and held significant power for several centuries. They are famously associated with a practice called \\"Habsburg Jaw\\" or \\"Habsburg Lip\\" due to the occurrence of genetic disorders caused by generations of intermarriage. The Habsburgs often sought to maintain their bloodline by marrying close relatives, resulting in prominent physical traits associated with inbreeding. Therefore, when someone jokingly brings up topics like incest, the response mentioning Ancient Egyptian royalty or the House of Habsburgs is meant to humorously link the subject matter to historical instances where such relationships were known to occur."},{"prompt":"What about when another answer to memes like this being a \\"Game of Thrones moment\\"?","completion":"When another answer to memes or jokes about incestuous topics is a \\"Game of Thrones moment,\\" it refers to the popular fantasy series \\"Game of Thrones\\" created by George R.R. Martin. The show prominently features incestuous relationships as a plot element. In \\"Game of Thrones,\\" there are multiple instances of characters engaging in incestuous relationships, most notably between Cersei and Jaime Lannister, who are twin siblings. The show portrays their relationship as taboo and controversial, often leading to dramatic consequences. Given the widespread popularity and cultural impact of \\"Game of Thrones,\\" referring to a joke or meme about incest as a \\"Game of Thrones moment\\" is a way to draw a parallel between the fictional world of the show and the topic being discussed. It's a lighthearted way of acknowledging the association between the series and the subject matter while also adding a humorous element to the conversation."},{"prompt":"In more morbid topics, what about statements like \\"The crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ is one of the most important events in the Christian faith. For the Roman Empire, it was just another day in the office.\\"?","completion":"Statements like \\"The crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ is one of the most important events in the Christian faith. For the Roman Empire, it was just another day in the office\\" contrast the significance of a historical event from different perspectives. In this specific example, the statement highlights the stark contrast between the profound religious significance of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and death in Christianity and the relatively routine nature of such executions for the Roman Empire. It juxtaposes the immense spiritual and theological implications for Christians with the historical context of the Roman Empire, where crucifixion was a common method of execution. By making this statement, the intention is to emphasize the difference in perception and significance of the event. It underscores the idea that while the crucifixion of Jesus holds immense religious and spiritual weight for Christians, it may have been just another routine occurrence for the Roman Empire, which regularly carried out such executions. This kind of statement can serve to provoke thought, highlight the contrast between different perspectives, or provide a critical commentary on the historical context and the varying interpretations of significant events."},{"prompt":"While not much of a meme, why do some people say \\"Nothing makes you seem like a terrible writer than by starting your story with the infamous \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\" line.\\"?","completion":"The phrase \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\" is often mocked and considered cliché in the realm of writing. It has become a well-known opening line associated with poorly written or overly dramatic stories. The line itself has been parodied and referenced in various forms of media, contributing to its reputation as a sign of bad writing. When people say, \\"Nothing makes you seem like a terrible writer than by starting your story with the infamous 'It was a dark and stormy night' line,\\" they are expressing the sentiment that using such a clichéd and overused opening can be seen as a lack of creativity or originality. It suggests that the writer may be relying on tired tropes and not putting in the effort to craft a unique and engaging introduction. The statement serves as a humorous way to highlight the importance of capturing the reader's attention from the very beginning and avoiding clichés that can detract from the quality of the writing. It encourages writers to think outside the box and strive for more imaginative and compelling openings to their stories."},{"prompt":"入党积极分子培训心得1500字","completion":"入党积极分子培训心得 作为一名大学生，我参加了学校举办的入党积极分子培训。通过此次培训，我深刻体会到了党的培养和教育的重要性，也对自己的思想政治素质有了新的认识和进步。在此，我将我的心得体会进行总结，以期对自己今后的学习工作有所帮助。 首先，在培训过程中，我深刻感受到了党的培养和教育对于大学生的重要意义。党的培养和教育是党培养青年学生党员的一种重要方式，也是提高学生思想、政治素质的有效途径。通过参加培训，我了解了中国共产党的党史、党纲、党章等基本知识，深入了解了党的理论和路线方针政策，对于了解和掌握党的基本知识有了全面的认识和把握。 其次，在培训过程中，我认识到了党员要具备的政治素质和道德品质的重要性。作为一名党员，要有坚定的理想信念，牢记党的宗旨，积极践行社会主义核心价值观；要有辩证思维和科学态度，正确认识自我和社会，具备正确的判断和决策能力；要有良好的道德品质，自觉遵守党的纪律和法律法规，养成良好的行为习惯和品德修养。这些要求为我今后的学习和工作提供了准则和标杆，我要时刻保持对党的忠诚和道德修养，不断提高自己的政治、思想和道德素质。 再次，在培训过程中，我理解到了党员要具备的组织观念和服务意识的重要性。作为一名党员，要增强组织观念，加强党性锻炼，主动融入党组织的工作，在思想上行动上同党中央保持高度一致；要增强服务意识，为人民群众着想，积极参与社会实践和志愿活动，为实现祖国的繁荣富强和人民的幸福生活贡献自己的力量。我要时刻自觉维护党的形象和声誉，发挥党员的先锋模范作用，为党和人民的事业作出自己的贡献。 最后，在培训过程中，我还体会到了自己今后学习和工作的方向和目标。参加培训让我更加明确了自己的人生理想和奋斗目标，我要以党的理想和信念为指引，立志从事为人民服务的事业，为祖国的繁荣富强和人民的幸福生活而奋斗。我要不断提高自己的综合素质，努力学习党的理论和知识，增强自己的能力和水平，为实现自己的人生理想和奋斗目标做好准备。 通过这次培训，我对大学生党员的基本要求和培养方法有了更加全面和深入的了解，也对自己今后学习和工作的方向有了明确的认识和定位。我要把这次培训作为一个新的起点，不断学习进取，不断提高自己的思想政治素质和综合能力，为实现中国梦、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而努力奋斗！"},{"prompt":"python爬取文献代码","completion":"以下是一个简单的Python爬取文献的例子： \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup def crawl_literature(url): # 发送GET请求获取网页内容 response = requests.get(url) # 使用BeautifulSoup解析网页内容 soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # 提取文献信息 title = soup.find('h1').text.strip() authors = [author.text for author in soup.select('.author-list .author-item')] abstract = soup.find(class_='abstract').text.strip() # 输出文献信息 print('标题:', title) print('作者:', ', '.join(authors)) print('摘要:', abstract) # 调用函数进行爬取 url = 'https://www.example.com/article' # 替换为要爬取的文献链接 crawl_literature(url) \`\`\` 请注意，这只是一个简单的示例，具体的爬取方法可能会因网站的结构和规则而有所不同。在实际应用中，可能需要根据具体网站的情况进行相应的调整和更改。"},{"prompt":"В результате прохождения производственной (эксплуатационной) практики на «ТиссенКрупп Индастриал Солюшнс(РУС)», я закрепила и расширила свои знания, овладела необходимыми практическими навыками работы, которые помогут мне в дальнейшем.

Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb's ability to layer multiple dreams within each other. He offers to hire Cobb for the supposedly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person's subconscious; performing \\"inception\\" on Robert, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father's company. Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream's architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind's projection of his late wife Mal. Maurice dies, and the team sedates Robert into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized \\"kick\\" to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously. The team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but they are attacked by his trained subconscious projections. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally awaken dreamers, Yusuf's sedatives will instead send them into \\"Limbo\\": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company. Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. Mal refused to return to reality, and Cobb instead performed inception on her to convince her. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to \\"wake up\\", she committed suicide and framed Cobb to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind. Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious. In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed. However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water, by rigging an elevator and the fortress respectively with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception and he and Saito are lost into Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert's inception and Eames's kick. Cobb makes peace with his part in causing Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived into the third level, he discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving at L.A., Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's \\"totem\\" – a top that spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children. Combine this plot with Overwatch.","completion":"In a futuristic version of the world, there exists a secret organization named Overwatch, which is dedicated to maintaining peace and order. The organization has developed advanced technology that allows its agents to enter and manipulate people's dreams in order to gather information and influence their thoughts. This technology is known as Dream-Share. Cobb and Arthur are two highly skilled agents of Overwatch who specialize in dream extraction. They are known for their ability to layer multiple dreams within each other, creating complex dreamscapes. Their latest mission involves infiltrating the dreams of a powerful and corrupt businessman named Saito, who is suspected of illegal activities. Saito becomes impressed with Cobb's skills and offers him a proposition. Saito wants Cobb to perform a seemingly impossible task known as inception. Inception involves planting an idea in someone's subconscious, making them believe it is their own. Saito wants Cobb to perform inception on Robert, the son of his biggest competitor Maurice Fischer. The idea is to dissolve Maurice's company and give Saito a significant advantage in the business world. In exchange for this job, Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status within Overwatch and allow him to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles a team of skilled individuals to assist him. This includes Eames, a master of disguise and forgery, Yusuf, a brilliant chemist who creates potent sedatives for the dream-sharing process, and Ariadne, a talented college student who excels in designing dream architectures. Ariadne is tasked with creating the dream architecture for the mission, as Cobb himself cannot do it due to the risk of being sabotaged by the projection of his deceased wife, Mal. Mal haunts Cobb's subconscious and has a tendency to interfere in his dreams, making her a dangerous presence. Despite this, Cobb is determined to complete the mission and be reunited with his children. The team proceeds with the plan, sedating Robert into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America. Each dream layer functions on a different timescale, with time running slower in each subsequent layer. To awaken the dreamers, one member of the team must stay behind on each layer to perform a synchronized \\"kick\\", which involves a physical action that causes a jolt in the dreamers' minds and brings them back to reality. The team successfully abducts Robert in the first level of the dream but faces strong opposition from his trained subconscious projections. Saito is injured during the conflict, and Cobb reveals the risky nature of their mission. Normally, dying in the dream would awaken the dreamers, but due to Yusuf's sedatives, death would instead send them into Limbo, a realm of infinite subconscious. This revelation adds another layer of danger to their mission. Eames takes on the identity of Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, in the dream to introduce the idea of an alternate will that would dissolve Maurice's company. Meanwhile, Cobb confides in Ariadne about his past with Mal. He explains that they had entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing and experienced fifty years in one night due to the time dilation in Limbo. Mal refused to return to reality, and Cobb was forced to perform inception on her to convince her. However, even after waking up, Mal continued to believe she was still dreaming. In her attempts to \\"wake up\\", she eventually committed suicide and framed Cobb to manipulate him into doing the same. Fleeing from the accusations and burdened by guilt, Cobb left the United States, leaving his children behind. Now, with the chance to return home, he is determined to fulfill Saito's request and complete the inception on Robert. The team progresses through the dream layers, with Yusuf driving them around in the first level, which is set in a city, and then sedating them into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb manipulates Robert into believing that he has been kidnapped by Browning and that Cobb is a defensive projection within Robert's subconscious. As part of a ruse to enter Robert's deepest subconscious, Cobb and Ariadne lead Robert to the third level, an alpine fortress where the inception can be performed. Within the fortress, the team faces a projection of Maurice, which poses a significant obstacle. Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, which sends the dreamers into Limbo prematurely. Arthur and Eames must then find alternate ways to synchronize the kicks and bring everyone back to reality in time. In Limbo, Cobb encounters Mal once again, who now acts as a physical manifestation of his guilt and regrets. He confronts her and makes peace with his part in her death, understanding that he cannot change the past. Ariadne helps him defeat Mal's projection, and together they rescue Saito and Robert from Limbo. Back in the third level, Robert finally awakens and discovers the planted idea within his subconscious: his dying father telling him to create something for himself, rather than being solely reliant on his father's empire. The mission is a success. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the rest of the team rides the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Cobb goes through the immigration checkpoint and is accompanied by his father-in-law to his home. In a final test to determine if he is truly in the real world, Cobb uses Mal's top, his \\"totem,\\" to check if it spins indefinitely. However, instead of watching the result, he decides to prioritize being present with his children. He joins them and embraces the opportunity to be with them at last. Combining the worlds of dream-sharing and Overwatch, this crossover narrative showcases the high-stakes mission of Cobb and his team as they navigate the complexities of dreams and manipulation to achieve their goals. With their specialized skills and unwavering determination, they overcome numerous obstacles, confront their inner demons, and ultimately find redemption and the possibility of a new beginning."},{"prompt":"Write a game based on the Plot of the first output.","completion":"Title: Dream Inception Game Overview: Dream Inception is an immersive and strategic video game that combines elements of espionage, puzzle-solving, and mind-bending dream manipulation.

Here are a few potential reasons and troubleshooting steps to help you resolve the problem: 1. Double-check the transistor pin configuration: Make sure you have connected the transistor correctly. Transistors have three pins: collector (C), base (B), and emitter (E). Ensure that you have connected the base pin to the controlling element (e.g., a microcontroller or an oscillator) while the collector and emitter pins are properly connected to the rest of the circuit. 2. Check the biasing resistors: Transistors often require biasing resistors to ensure proper operation. Verify that you have correctly chosen and connected the appropriate biasing resistors to the base pin. Ensure that the resistor values are within the appropriate range to control the transistor's behavior. 3. Test the controlling element: If you are using a microcontroller or an oscillator to control the transistor, examine the signal output from the controlling element. Utilize an oscilloscope or a multimeter to confirm that the controlling element is generating the expected pulse signals. Ensure that the signal's voltage levels and timing match the requirements of the transistor. 4. Verify the power supply: Ensure that the power supply to the circuit is stable and providing the required voltage levels. An unstable power supply may cause unexpected behavior or malfunctioning of the transistor. 5. Test the transistor separately: Disconnect the transistor from the circuit and test it individually with a multimeter. Examine the datasheet for the specific transistor you are using and measure the voltages applied to the necessary pins (e.g., base-emitter, collector-emitter) to ensure they fall within the acceptable range. This step will help determine if the transistor itself is faulty or if there is an issue with the circuit. 6. Review the circuit design: Double-check your circuit design, schematic, and component connections against the desired functionality. Look for any potential shorts, open connections, or incorrect component placements that may be causing unintended behavior. If you are unable to pinpoint the issue by following these troubleshooting steps, it may be helpful to seek assistance from a knowledgeable electronics hobbyist, engineer, or an online community specific to your pulse pendulum project for further guidance."},{"prompt":"is my bias resistor to high maybe","completion":"Yes, if your bias resistor is too high, it could potentially keep the transistor turned on continuously. The biasing resistors are responsible for controlling the base current of the transistor, which determines whether it is on or off. To determine the appropriate bias resistor values, you need to consider the base current required to turn on the transistor and the gain (hFE) of the transistor. You can refer to the transistor datasheet to find the required base current and calculate the bias resistor values accordingly. If the bias resistor is too large, it may not provide enough base current to turn off the transistor completely, resulting in it being always on. Try reducing the value of the bias resistor and see if the transistor behavior improves. However, be cautious not to go too low with the resistor value, as it can cause excessive base current and potentially damage the transistor. Additionally, ensure that you have connected the bias resistor correctly to the base pin of the transistor and that there are no shorts or open connections in the biasing circuit. Double-checking the wiring and circuit connections can also help troubleshoot the issue."},{"prompt":"c++中，int类型的数组传递给函数，形参怎么写","completion":"在C++中，可以将int类型的数组传递给函数，其中形参的写法有多种方式。以下是两种常用的方式： 1. 使用数组指针作为形参： \`\`\`cpp void functionName(int* arr, int size) { // 函数体代码 } \`\`\` 在函数内部，可以通过指针访问传入的数组元素。需要注意的是，传递数组指针时，需要同时传递数组的大小，以便在函数内部正确访问数组元素。 2. 使用数组引用作为形参： \`\`\`cpp void functionName(int (&arr)[size]) { // 函数体代码 } \`\`\` 在函数内部，可以直接使用传入的数组变量，无需使用指针进行访问。 需要注意的是，使用静态数组作为参数时，必须显式指定数组的大小。同时，由于C++不允许使用动态数组作为函数参数，因此如果需要处理变长数组，可能需要使用std::vector或者动态分配的数组等数据结构。"},{"prompt":"vim如何搜索指定字符，在字符中如何加入统配符","completion":"在Vim中，搜索指定字符可以使用 \\"/\\" 命令进行搜索。在搜索字符串中添加通配符可以使用正则表达式的方式。 下面是一些常用的通配符和正则表达式用法： 1. 使用 \\"?\\" 来匹配任意一个字符。 例如，要搜索包含 \\"abc\\" 和紧接着一个字符的字符串，可以使用命令： \`\`\` /abc? \`\`\` 2. 使用 \\"*\\" 来匹配零个或多个字符。 例如，要搜索以 \\"abc\\" 开头和以 \\"xyz\\" 结尾的字符串，可以使用命令： \`\`\` /abc.*xyz \`\`\` 3. 使用 \\"|\\" 来匹配多个模式中的一个。 例如，要搜索包含 \\"foo\\" 或 \\"bar\\" 的字符串，可以使用命令： \`\`\` /foo|bar \`\`\` 4. 使用 \\"()\\" 来创建捕获组。 例如，要搜索以 \\"abc\\" 开头和紧接着一个或多个 \\"xyz\\" 字符的字符串，可以使用命令： \`\`\` /abc(xyz)+ \`\`\` 这只是一些基本的示例，Vim支持更丰富的正则表达式语法和模式匹配功能。可以通过查阅Vim的文档来了解更多关于搜索和正则表达式的内容。在Vim中，可以使用 \\":help\\" 命令来查看帮助文档，例如 \\":help pattern\\" 来查看关于模式匹配的帮助信息。"},{"prompt":"Você pode criar um desenho para mim?","completion":"Claro!

The air was cool and comfortable, with no suffocating heat to weigh down on the world. The sun shone brightly from behind the trees, illuminating the foliage and creating patches of sunlight that danced across the ground. The leaves swayed gently in the mild breeze, rustling softly like a lullaby. As Jon Beckman Halcoc, a First Lieutenant in The United States Air Force (U.S.A.F.), looked out the window of his home, he could hear the characteristic sound of helicopters hovering overhead. ‘Seems like yesterday, but no, the way things went off, the way things are still, will they resolve, wish I knew’ thought Jon. In the kitchen on the radio the sound of jazz could be herd. They were there for news and police coverage, a reminder of the world beyond his peaceful street. The Doppler Effect produced by distant traffic was also noticeable, a constant hum in the background. In the yards on his street, dogs played and slept their barks and snores adding to the symphony of sounds. Every so often, a cat would be seen sleeping on a wall, basking in the warmth of the sun. Jon lightly tapped on the wooden window frame, taking in the beauty of the day before proceeding to climb upstairs. He strolled with a cane, a reminder of the mishap that occurred during his deployment abroad. As he reached the top of the stairs, he discovered Emily unzipping a suitcase on their bed. The scent of freshly laundered clothes filled the room, and Jon could feel the softness of the sheets under his fingertips. He took a deep breath, savouring the moment before breaking the news to Emily that they would be flying to Los Angeles the following day. Jon didn't want to go, but it was time to resolve a family dispute that had been going on since 1986. ‘Painful as it is I have to go. he said…there are things to resolve that cannot be done any other way. I am so near to closure and yet what will I do when I find it’ It was time to put things to rest, and he knew that he couldn't avoid it any longer. With a heavy heart, he watched as Emily continued to pack, the sound of the zipper closing on the suitcase echoing in his mind, the sound was like a note of finality. As the day drew to a close, Jon couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy. He knew that the next few days would be difficult, but he also knew that it was necessary. He closed his eyes, taking in the sounds and smells of the day, committing them to memory before the journey ahead. ‘Hello,’ Jon said quietly. Emily turned, smiled in response. 'Sorry we have to do this and for dragging you into this in the first place,' Jon said, propping his head on the door frame. Are you sure we have to go there, Jon?' Emily tried being her most reassuring self. 'I genuinely appreciate it! That means a lot to me.' Even so, yes, we do need to leave. 'If I could find a different way, I'd take it, but there isn't one that works.' Jon sighed and looked down, despondent. 'Okay, it's settled. We're going to your parents' house. Your sister Anna is coming, right? 'She would, but the way things are between her and Mom, I don’t want another repeat of that.' ‘Not an enjoyable occasion. That's right, I recall it now! Anna really let loose on that long diatribe. About your mom, Cristina, not showing her proper respect and how she was beyond frustrated.’ 'Look, we're booked through on the Red Eye tomorrow at 22:00 p.m.' ‘We'll go to get this sorted out,’ ‘Then I won't have to see them for a while, anyway!’ Emily smiled at Jon, relieved a family dispute, begun eight years ago with a disagreement. Might soon end. June 7th was when it all started. Jon’s father, Jake Halcoc, had served in NAM flying F4s; he retired as a lieutenant major. His uncle Steve had served in both Korea and NAM and retired as a lieutenant colonel. 'Jon, when do you have to report back to the base?' Jake said, ‘Not like you, already forgetting!’ Friday of next week, so another seven days; don't worry, I'm not going absent without leave (AWOL)... Okay!' Jon said. 'Make sure you don't, because you're in the Air Force, and that means something in this family.' 'Anything less, and well, there goes the country; you might as well quit.' ‘Let the Reds take over the democratic world; damn freeloaders in the service nowadays!’ ‘Jon remembered…There goes dad again it’s the same old chime about the service today, I wish he’d stop, but still he’d only get worse if he was told to stop’ ‘That's not in order; it will never be my intention. Either by deliberate action or by other design, barring accident. To ever do that? I intend being in the service for a long time. Comparing me to the red menace doesn't serve anyone, okay?’ Jon said. 'What in all the heavens is going on in here?’ ‘Now let’s not have any more talk between you about going AWOL. Comparing someone to the Red Menace; it's unpleasant, unpatriotic, and un-American.' Jon's mom, Cristina Edger Halcoc, said.","completion":"Overall, the story text has a good foundation and possesses some strong imagery and descriptive language. However, there are areas where it can be strengthened and certain literary devices that can be incorporated. 1. Character Development: The story could benefit from deeper character development. Explore the emotions and motivations of Jon and Emily regarding the family dispute and their trip to Los Angeles. This will create a stronger connection between the readers and the characters. 2. Show, Don't Tell: Instead of explicitly stating the characters' thoughts and emotions, find ways to show them through their actions, dialogue, and gestures. This will make the story more engaging and immersive for the readers. 3. Foreshadowing: Use foreshadowing to create suspense and intrigue. Provide hints or subtle clues about the nature of the family dispute or what Jon might encounter when he reaches his parents' house. This will keep readers invested in the story and curious to find out more. 4. Symbolism: Incorporate symbols to add depth and layers of meaning to the story. For example, the cane that Jon uses can symbolize both his physical injury and his emotional burdens. Explore additional symbols that can enhance the themes and messages of the story. 5. Dialogue: Make the dialogue more authentic and natural. Give each character a distinct voice and idiosyncrasies that reflect their personalities. Consider using more contractions and informal language to make the conversations sound more realistic. 6. Conflict and Tension: Heighten the conflict and tension between the characters. Explore the complexities and underlying reasons for the family dispute. This will create a more engaging and dynamic narrative. 7. Sensory Details: While there are some strong descriptions of the setting, incorporate more sensory details to fully immerse the readers in the scene. Use vivid language to describe the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures to create a more vivid and immersive reading experience. 8. Pacing: Vary the pacing of the story to maintain the readers' interest. Consider adding moments of tension, suspense, or action to break up slower-paced sections and keep readers engaged. By incorporating these suggestions, the story will become more compelling, engaging, and evoke a stronger emotional response from readers."},{"prompt":"With pacing how can this be done without disrupting the flow of what is being said.","completion":"To adjust the pacing without disrupting the flow of the story, you can consider the following techniques: 1. Short, Intense Sentences: Use shorter sentences to create a sense of urgency or to convey fast-paced action. This can help increase the tempo of the story without sacrificing clarity or coherence. For example, during moments of conflict or heightened emotion, use shorter sentences to create a sense of intensity. 2. Transition Sentences: Use transitional phrases or sentences to smoothly shift between slower-paced and faster-paced sections of the story. This can help maintain a natural flow while still introducing elements of suspense or action. For instance, after a slower-paced descriptive paragraph, you can use a transition sentence like \\"Little did they know, the calm would soon give way to chaos.\\" 3. Cliffhangers: Ending a section or chapter with a cliffhanger can create anticipation and propel the reader forward. It encourages readers to keep reading to find out what happens next. Carefully choose moments within the story where leaving the reader hanging will have the most impact. 4. Dialogue: Engaging and dynamic dialogue exchanges can inject energy into the story. Use snappy dialogue in moments of conflict or tension to create a faster pace. Vary the length of the dialogue sentences and intersperse them with action beats or character reactions to maintain a dynamic rhythm. 5. Action Sequences: When there's a need for a faster pace or heightened tension, consider incorporating action sequences. Use descriptive language and quick-paced sentence structure to convey the urgency and movement of the action. This can add a burst of excitement and drive the narrative forward. 6. Vary Sentence Lengths: Mixing up sentence lengths can create a more dynamic reading experience. Longer sentences can be used to slow down the pace and provide detailed descriptions, while shorter sentences can convey quick actions or thoughts. Varying the sentence structure and length helps to maintain reader engagement. Remember to balance the pacing throughout the story and use these techniques strategically. Consider the overall tone and narrative arc to determine where adjustments in pacing would be most effective."},{"prompt":"In the context of the provied text what do you mean by 'Action Sequnces'","completion":"In the provided text, \\"action sequences\\" refer to moments in the story where there is physical or intense activity taking place.

These sequences can help break up slower-paced sections and create moments of intensity.

Instead, you can focus on other forms of action sequences that align better with her character and the overall tone of the story. Here are a few alternative ideas: 1. Internal Conflict: Explore Emily's inner turmoil and struggle with her conflicting emotions regarding the family dispute. Show her grappling with her desire to support Jon while also feeling apprehensive about the potential conflict with his family. This can create tension and provide a different type of action within the story. 2. Emotional Confrontation: Instead of a heated argument, you can depict a scene where Emily calmly and assertively expresses her opinion or concerns to Jon about the upcoming trip and the family dispute. This can still convey strong emotions and create a moment of tension between the characters without resorting to an argument. 3. Symbolic Actions: Use symbolic actions to convey Emily's strong emotions. For example, she could engage in a calming activity like meditation or painting to help channel her thoughts and emotions. This can provide insight into her internal world and create a sense of action within the story. 4. Decision-Making Moment: Portray a significant decision that Emily must make related to the family dispute. Show her contemplating various options, weighing the potential consequences, and ultimately taking a decisive action based on her convictions. This can create a sense of action and agency for her character. Remember to ensure that any action sequences remain true to the character's psychology and the overall tone of the story.

Layer 2 refers to off-chain scaling solutions that are designed to alleviate congestion and increase transaction throughput by handling transactions off the main blockchain. Here are a few options to consider in order to make your crypto token L2: 1. Sidechains: Sidechains are separate blockchains that are interoperable with the main chain. By deploying your token on a sidechain, you can offload a significant portion of the transactions from the main chain, increasing scalability. Sidechains usually have their own consensus mechanism and can have faster block times. 2. State Channels: State channels allow users to conduct off-chain transactions that only settle on the main chain when necessary. By implementing state channels, you can enable fast, low-cost, and private transactions between participants without relying on the main chain for every transaction. 3. Plasma: Plasma is a framework that enables the creation of independent, scalable blockchains that can be connected to the main chain. By deploying your token on a Plasma chain, you can achieve high scalability while benefiting from the security of the main chain. 4. Rollups: Rollups are Layer 2 solutions that bundle multiple transactions and submit them to the main chain as a single compressed proof, significantly reducing the cost and time required for settling transactions on the main chain. By utilizing rollup technology, you can enhance the scalability of your token. It's important to note that implementing a Layer 2 solution requires technical expertise and a thorough understanding of the chosen solution. Additionally, consider the trade-offs between scalability, security, decentralization, and the compatibility of your token with various Layer 2 solutions. Consulting with blockchain developers or experts specializing in Layer 2 solutions would be advisable to guide you through the implementation process."},{"prompt":"关于严明政治纪律和政治规矩，推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化的调研报告","completion":"调研报告：关于严明政治纪律和政治规矩，推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化的调研报告 一、调研背景和目的 政治纪律和政治规矩是党内政治生活的重要准则，是全面从严治党的基本要求。推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化，是加强党性锻炼，建设过硬党员队伍的关键之一。为了深入了解党员对政治纪律和政治规矩的理解和遵守情况，本次调研旨在查明问题，提出改进措施，进一步推进党风廉政建设和反腐败工作。 二、调研方法和范围 本次调研采用问卷调查、深度访谈和文件资料分析相结合的方式进行，调研对象主要包括党员、党员干部以及有关政治监督部门的工作人员。 三、调研结果 1. 对于党的政治纪律和政治规矩的理解：大多数受访者对党的政治纪律和政治规矩有较为清晰的认识，但在具体操作中存在一定的模糊性和不一致性。 2. 对党的政治纪律和政治规矩的遵守情况：绝大多数党员和党员干部认为遵守党的政治纪律和政治规矩是党员的应尽义务，但存在少数党员违反政治纪律的现象。 3. 政治监督工作的现状：政治监督工作已经取得了一定的成效，但仍存在监督手段不够多样化、精准度有待提高、监督内容不够全面的问题。 4. 推进政治监督具体化、精准化、常态化的意见和建议：应根据党的政治纪律和政治规矩的要求，制定具体可操作的具体工作程序和办法；加强对党内政治纪律和政治规矩的宣传教育，提高党员的纪律意识和自觉遵守度；加大对政治监督工作的支持力度，提高政治监督的效果和精准度。 四、改进措施 1. 制定加强党内政治纪律和政治规矩具体工作程序和办法，确保工作的规范性和可操作性。 2. 加强宣传教育，通过党课、培训等形式，提高党员对党的政治纪律和政治规矩的认识和遵守度。 3. 完善政治监督体制，加大对政治监督工作的支持力度，提高政治监督的效果和精准度。 4. 建立健全监督和惩处机制，对违反政治纪律和政治规矩的行为进行严肃处理，形成震慑效应。 五、结论 通过调研可以看出，加强党内政治纪律和政治规矩的具体化、精准化、常态化工作任重道远。只有进一步加强宣传教育、健全监督机制，严肃处理违反政治纪律和政治规矩的行为，才能真正推动党风廉政建设和反腐败工作向纵深发展。"},{"prompt":"Olá!

It is characterized by a combination of modernist and postmodernist influences, while also incorporating elements of other styles and movements. Here are some key features of metamodernist architecture: 1. Hybridity: Metamodernist architecture embraces a hybrid approach that combines multiple architectural styles and influences. It seeks to break away from rigid categorizations and experiment with different design elements. 2. Contextualism: Metamodernist architects pay a great deal of attention to the context in which a building is located, both in terms of physical surroundings and cultural context. They strive to create designs that respond to and integrate with their surroundings. 3. Materiality: The use of materials is an essential aspect of metamodernist architecture. Architects often explore new materials and construction techniques, seeking to create innovative combinations and juxtapositions. 4. Emotional resonance: Metamodernist architecture aims to evoke an emotional response from occupants and viewers. It focuses on creating spaces that elicit feelings of awe, wonder, and contemplation. 5. Sensory experience: In addition to an emotional response, metamodernist architecture emphasizes sensory experiences. It incorporates elements that engage multiple senses, such as light, sound, texture, and color, creating immersive environments. 6. Sustainability: Many metamodernist architects prioritize sustainability and environmentally friendly design practices. They strive to reduce the ecological impact of buildings by using energy-efficient technologies, sustainable materials, and incorporating natural elements. 7. Adaptability: Metamodernist architecture recognizes the need for buildings to be adaptable and flexible. It embraces the concept of \\"open works\\" that can be modified and reconfigured to meet changing needs and evolve over time. 8. Playfulness and irony: Metamodernist architecture often incorporates a sense of playfulness and irony. Architects may use humor, unexpected juxtapositions, or paradoxical elements to challenge traditional notions of architecture and provoke thought and discussion. It is important to note that as metamodernism is a relatively new concept, its definition and key features are still evolving. Different architects and theorists may have varying interpretations and approaches to metamodernist architecture."},{"prompt":"Outline how these strategies could influence good martian architecture design","completion":"Applying the key features of metamodernist architecture to the design of Martian architecture would involve considering the unique challenges and context of building on Mars. Here's an outline of how these strategies could influence good Martian architecture design: 1. Hybridity: Martian architecture could draw inspiration from various architectural styles, merging modernist and postmodernist elements with futuristic and space-exploration influences. It would combine functionality with aesthetics, blending traditional design principles with innovative approaches suited to the Martian environment. 2. Contextualism: Martian architecture must respond to the physical and cultural context of Mars. It would consider factors such as the harsh climate, limited resources, and the scientific and exploratory nature of Martian colonization. Design choices would take into account the solar cycles, radiation levels, dust storms, and the need to integrate with future research facilities or sustainable colonies. 3. Materiality: Given the scarcity of traditional building materials on Mars, Martian architecture would experiment with materials that are available locally or could be produced using Martian resources. This might involve using regolith (Martian soil), ice, or other compounds found on the planet. Research into 3D printing techniques using these materials could enable the construction of durable and sustainable structures. 4. Emotional resonance: Martian architecture would aim to create spaces that elicit emotional responses from its inhabitants. The design of habitats, research stations, and public spaces would consider the psychological well-being of astronauts and researchers by including elements that provide comfort, connection with nature, and a sense of wonder, despite the inhospitable environment. 5. Sensory experience: Given the isolation and alienness of the Martian landscape, architectural design would aim to engage multiple senses. This could include incorporating natural lighting strategies, using soundscapes that evoke a connection to Earth, integrating tactile surfaces or materials for a haptic experience, and exploring virtual or augmented reality technologies to create immersive environments. 6. Sustainability: Martian architecture would prioritize sustainable design practices to minimize the ecological impact and ensure resource efficiency. Buildings would incorporate energy-efficient technologies, recycling systems, and closed-loop water management. Modular and adaptable design principles would allow for easy expansion and repurposing of structures to accommodate future needs and changing conditions. 7. Adaptability: As Martian colonization progresses and the needs of the colony evolve, architecture would focus on flexibility and adaptability. Structures would be designed for easy reconfiguration, expansion, or repurposing to accommodate changes in population, research priorities, or technological advancements. 8. Playfulness and irony: Incorporating elements of playfulness and irony could help alleviate the psychological challenges of living in a confined and inhospitable environment. Designing spaces that create moments of joy, surprise, or humor through unexpected features, interactive installations, or artistic interventions could enhance the overall human experience on Mars. It must be noted that designing for Mars is a complex task that requires input from multiple disciplines. Architects, engineers, scientists, and psychologists would collaborate to ensure the creation of safe, functional, and inviting environments that meet the physical and psychological needs of Martian inhabitants."},{"prompt":"In point form, simply outline how environmental psychology applies to Martian architecture and what those applications strategies are","completion":"- Environmental psychology applies to Martian architecture by studying how the built environment affects human behavior, emotions, and well-being in the context of living on Mars. - Application strategies for Martian architecture based on environmental psychology include: 1. Biophilic design: Incorporating elements of nature, such as plants, natural light, and views of the Martian landscape, to enhance mood, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being. 2. Personalization and control: Allowing inhabitants to personalize their living spaces and providing control over environmental factors like lighting, temperature, and privacy to foster a sense of autonomy and satisfaction. 3. Privacy and retreat spaces: Designing private areas within habitats to provide inhabitants with a sense of personal space and refuge from the communal living environment. 4. Social spaces: Creating communal areas where inhabitants can interact, collaborate, and engage in social activities to promote a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation. 5. Daylight and circadian rhythm: Designing spaces with access to natural light and considering artificial lighting strategies that mimic the Martian day-night cycles to regulate circadian rhythms and promote healthy sleep patterns. 6. Visual connections and vistas: Incorporating views of the Martian landscape or simulated natural scenes to provide visual interest, a sense of connection to Earth, and promote cognitive restoration. 7. Wayfinding and orientation: Ensuring clear signage, landmarks, and intuitive navigational cues within habitats to reduce stress and anxiety associated with disorientation or getting lost. 8. Acoustic comfort: Controlling noise levels and designing spaces with sound-absorbing materials to create a peaceful and comfortable auditory environment. 9. Ergonomics and adaptability: Designing functional and adaptable spaces that accommodate the physical needs and movements of inhabitants, considering the effects of reduced gravity and the potential for muscle and bone loss. 10. Mental and emotional well-being: Incorporating spaces for relaxation, meditation, and reflection that promote mental and emotional well-being while acknowledging the potential psychological challenges of living in an isolated and extreme environment. It is important to adapt these applications to the specific conditions and limitations of living on Mars, considering factors such as available resources, technological advancements, and the unique challenges of the Martian environment. Ongoing research and collaboration between environmental psychologists, architects, and scientists would be vital to optimizing the psychological well-being of Martian inhabitants."},{"prompt":"Provide references","completion":"I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to a reference database.

In view of this, talent management in China is in a period of transformation (Cooke, 2021; Preece et al., 2021). In the early years of China's reform and opening up, multinational enterprises (MNEs) attracted a lot of attention because they were perceived by local workers as a \\"priority choice\\", with \\"favourable remuneration\\" and \\"good employment prospects\\" (Manpower, 2020). In recent years, however, this attitude has changed. Chinese workers with high potential have become increasingly inclined to choose local firms (Schmidt, 2021). This change is mainly due to the economic crisis in 2008, which hit international companies and their brands hard, and at the same time, the Chinese economy and local employment opportunities continue to increase (Manpower, 2020; Schmidt, 2021). During this time, international companies are laying off workers, cutting costs, and sometimes laying off workers. From this point of view, the change in the attitude of Chinese workers makes sense, because these international companies are restructuring, resulting in slower economic growth and fewer opportunities to find jobs abroad. However, competition for top talent is not just competition between multinational companies. China's state-owned and private companies compete for a share of top talent by raising wages, often at the expense of multinationals. The traditional advantages of attracting talent, brand awareness, high salaries and career development opportunities are gradually disappearing. Therefore, in order to obtain and maintain competitive advantages in the Chinese market, both international and Chinese enterprises need to carry out strategic talent management to meet the current talent challenges. Researchers agree that talent management is becoming a major topic in human resources (Michaels et al., 2011; Sandler et al., 2016; Collings and Mellahi, 2019). However, the problem now is how to manage talent in various industries in China seems to be a challenge. In particular, some rapidly growing small and medium-sized private enterprises, due to a lack of formal organizational performance management experience, can not understand the impact of talent failure on business performance and growth. As a result, these companies tend to ignore the talent management process until it has negative consequences (Millar, 2013). In view of this, more and more enterprises are beginning to pay attention to the practice of talent management and apply it to China's economic environment. In addition, much of the existing literature emphasizes the importance of understanding the different drivers of how people work, how businesses are organized, how businesses are managed, and how business talent is managed (Wilkins, 2012). There are a number of external drivers, such as economic development, cultural diversity, demographic changes, global expansion planning, and technological progress (Christensen Hughes and Rog, 2018; Schuler et al., 2021). However, since China began its socio-economic reforms in the late 1970s, it has undergone a profound market-oriented, and integrated its economy into globalized capital (Newton and Subbaraman, 2012; Warner, 2018). A lot of research has been done on this. However, there has been little in-depth research into whether the same drivers exist in the Chinese business environment. In addition, a large number of theoretical and empirical studies on strategic talent management have examined the shortage of managerial talent in developed countries such as North America and Western Europe (Wooldridge, 2017; Goldstone, 2020; Schuler et al., 2021). However, little research has been done on developing countries. In emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the challenges for young professionals and new managers are most acute. Consequently, in emerging markets, business executives are increasingly aware of the need for effective traditional management strategies and practices (Lepak et al., 2013; Huselid and Becker, 2021). However, there are few studies (e.g., Boxall and Macky, 2019) that focus on employees' subjective evaluation of talent management activities and whether perceived activities have a significant impact on employees' attitudes and behaviours. In particular, Lewis (2013) believes that Chinese managers are reluctant to understand employees' evaluation of technical management performance, which is mainly due to the lack of interpersonal communication between Chinese enterprises and employees. Poor communication quality is consistent with low employee engagement and low positive work attitudes. According to the research objectives of this paper, the author will specifically study the following two questions: Research Question 1: Which talent management is used by Domestic and International Companies in China? Research Question 2: What are the driving forces that influence talent management practices in Domestic and International Companies in China?","completion":"The research aims to investigate the talent management practices used by domestic and international companies in China and the driving forces that influence these practices.

In the context of cancer, this competition between tumor cells and immune cells plays a critical role in determining the outcome of the disease. Dietary control can modulate this cell competition and potentially enhance cancer therapy. 1. Promoting immune cell fitness: A healthy immune system is crucial for effective cancer control. Certain nutrients, such as vitamins (e.g., vitamin C, D, and E) and minerals (e.g., zinc, selenium), play a key role in immune cell development and function. Including foods rich in these nutrients, such as citrus fruits, berries, leafy greens, fish, and nuts, in the diet can enhance the fitness and activity of immune cells, enabling them to better compete with tumor cells. 2. Anti-inflammatory diet: Chronic inflammation is known to support tumor growth and contribute to immune dysfunction. Consuming an anti-inflammatory diet can reduce inflammation, creating a more favorable environment for immune cells to compete against tumor cells. Such a diet includes foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids (e.g., fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts), fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants (e.g., berries, tomatoes, and spinach), and whole grains. 3. Caloric restriction: Restricting caloric intake or intermittent fasting has been shown to improve immune cell function and reduce tumor growth in animal studies. This dietary intervention can enhance cell competition by promoting the survival and activity of immune cells while depriving tumor cells of the energy and resources needed for their proliferation. 4. Ketogenic diet: The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has gained attention for its potential anti-tumor effects. By drastically reducing carbohydrate intake, the body switches to using ketones as an alternative energy source. This diet has shown promising results in preclinical studies by suppressing tumor growth and enhancing immune cell function. However, more research is needed to fully understand its efficacy and safety in humans. 5. Gut microbiome modulation: Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome plays a critical role in immune cell development and response. Dietary interventions such as consuming prebiotics (fiber-rich foods) and probiotics (fermented foods, yogurt) can promote a healthy gut microbiome, which in turn can enhance immune cell function and improve cell competition against tumors. It is important to note that while dietary control can influence cell competition, it should be used as a complementary approach to standard cancer therapies. Consulting with healthcare professionals and registered dietitians is crucial to designing an individualized diet plan that supports overall health and complements cancer treatment."},{"prompt":"rewrite this title \\"Dietary control of cell competition between tumor and immune cells for cancer therapy\\"","completion":"Controlling Cell Competition between Tumor and Immune Cells with Diet for Cancer Therapy"},{"prompt":"rewrite \\"By revealing the competition between macrophages and cancer cells, this study has demonstrated a new nutrient-controlled cancer inhibition pathway. \\"","completion":"Through the unveiling of the competition between macrophages and cancer cells, this study has established a novel pathway for cancer inhibition that is regulated by nutrients."},{"prompt":"rewrite \\"Dietary modulation of cell competition between tumor and immune cells hold promise for malignant cancer control\\"","completion":"The potential of dietary modulation in influencing cell competition between tumor and immune cells presents an encouraging avenue for the control of malignant cancer."},{"prompt":"polish this title \\"“Dietary modulation of cell competition between tumor and immune cells hold promise for malignant cancer control”\\"","completion":"\\"Dietary Modulation of Cell Competition between Tumor and Immune Cells: Promising Strategies for Malignant Cancer Control\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Change your working directory to the newly created \\"functions\\" directory: \`\`\` cd functions \`\`\` 6. Install the necessary dependencies for Firebase Functions: \`\`\` npm install firebase-functions \`\`\` 7. Open the \\"index.js\\" file in the \\"functions\\" directory and add the following code to define your Firebase Function: \`\`\`javascript const functions = require('firebase-functions'); exports.dispatchTask = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => { // Your task dispatching code here // For example, you can send a task to a worker by making an HTTP request // to another API endpoint: fetch('https://example.com/dispatch', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ task: 'exampleTask' }), headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, }) .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => { // Process the response from the worker console.log(data); res.status(200).send('Task dispatched successfully'); }) .catch(error => { console.error('Error dispatching task:', error); res.status(500).send('Error dispatching task'); }); }); \`\`\` This example shows how to send a task to a worker by making a POST request to an API endpoint. You can modify this code to suit your specific requirements. 8. Deploy the Firebase Function to your Firebase project by running the following command: \`\`\` firebase deploy --only functions \`\`\` This command will upload your function code to Firebase and make it accessible via an HTTPS endpoint. 9. After the deployment is successful, you can access your Firebase Function by using the provided HTTPS endpoint. For example: \`\`\` https://<your-project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/dispatchTask \`\`\` Whenever a request is made to this endpoint, the task dispatching code will be executed, sending a task to the worker. That's it!

Diabe Smasher’s hair is a sleek shade of dark gray, reaching just above his shoulders. He often wears practical attire suited for combat, reflecting his readiness to protect the kingdom. Background: As the last orphan of the “Berserker” clan of Faunus, Diabe Smasher has faced adversity from a young age. Possessing the ability to transform into a werewolf after coming into contact with Grimm’s “blood,” Diabe Smasher was taken in and adopted by Professor Ozpin. From then on, he became an integral part of the Ozpin family, growing up alongside Aemreh and being regarded as her older brother. Abilities: When transformed into his werewolf state, Diabe Smasher gains increased strength, speed, and heightened senses. His senses become more attuned and he exhibits exceptional agility, allowing him to navigate difficult terrains with ease. In this state, he becomes a formidable force against the Grimm, able to take them on with great efficiency and strength. Diabe Smasher also has the unique ability to sense and track down Grimm, adding to his effectiveness as a protector. Relationships: Diabe Smasher shares a close bond with Aemreh, acting as her protective older brother. Their relationship is built on trust and a shared sense of duty, as they both strive to live up to Professor Ozpin’s teachings. Diabe Smasher deeply respects and admires his adoptive father, recognizing the wisdom and guidance Ozpin has provided him throughout his life. Personality: Despite being feared by some due to his ability to go berserk, Diabe Smasher possesses a strong sense of justice and righteousness. He is determined to use his power for good and protect those in need, especially against the Grimm. Diabe Smasher exudes strength and possesses an unyielding determination, always ready to defend his loved ones and the people of Vale. Though reserved and stoic at times, he also demonstrates a caring and protective nature towards Aemreh, ensuring her safety is his top priority. Deep down, Diabe Smasher holds a longing to find a place of acceptance and understanding, where his abilities are seen as a gift rather than a curse. Please generate a detailed setting for the character based on the following description. Aemreh Ozpin is a 13 year old girl who, as the daughter of Professor Ozpin, is the youngest student at the Beacon Academy. She is a hybrid of the four daughters of Ozma and Salem from a distant mythological era, and is a clone created by the most advanced biotechnology in the Kingdom of Vale. Aemreh has striking features with long flowing platinum-blonde hair that reaches her waist. Her large, piercing sapphire-blue eyes hold wisdom beyond her years, and her fair complexion complements her ethereal appearance. Standing at an average height for her age, she possesses a lean and graceful build with an air of mystery and elegance. Unlike regular humans, Aemreh lacks Aura, the powerful energy field possessed by most individuals. However, she possesses an incredible reservoir of magical energy, a remnant of the ancient and mythical magic that exists only in legends and folklore. This enables her to tap into this ancient source of power, granting her extraordinary abilities that remain unmatched in the present world.","completion":"Setting: Vale Academy, Kingdom of Vale Vale Academy is a prestigious institution located in the Kingdom of Vale, one of the major kingdoms in Remnant. Situated in a serene and picturesque landscape, the academy is nestled within thick forests and rolling hills, offering a tranquil and idyllic setting for its students. The campus itself is a sprawling complex of grand buildings, lush gardens, and training grounds, providing a balance between academia and combat training. The main building of Vale Academy stands tall with its elegant architecture, featuring tall spires and stained glass windows depicting the history and heroes of the kingdom. Inside, the academy is a hub of knowledge, with well-stocked libraries, advanced laboratories, and classrooms equipped with the latest technology to nourish young minds. The halls are abuzz with students, their excited chatter filling the air as they rush between classes, bonding with peers, and honing their skills. Adjacent to the main building is the training arena, an expansive space with various terrains that simulate real-world combat scenarios. Here, students engage in rigorous combat training, honing their abilities and pushing themselves to their limits. The arena is equipped with holographic systems that recreate the presence of Grimm, allowing students to sharpen their skills against these formidable adversaries. Surrounding the academy are vast gardens, lush with diverse flora and fauna. The tall trees offer shade and a sense of tranquility, providing the perfect backdrop for students to unwind and find solace amidst their studies and combat training. The gardens serve as a sanctuary for quiet reflection, where students can meditate or practice their abilities in harmony with nature. Beyond the academy, the Kingdom of Vale is a bustling hub of activity. The kingdom is known for its prosperous commerce, with busy markets and elegant shops lining the streets. Despite the constant hustle and bustle, the kingdom maintains a sense of security, thanks in part to the efforts of Beacon Academy's students and faculty. Vale itself is a kingdom built on harmony, valuing diversity and the pursuit of knowledge. Its citizens are known for their industriousness and dedication to the arts and sciences. While Grimm incursions are a constant threat, the kingdom's strong defense forces, including the Dark guard and skilled hunters and huntresses, keep the populace safe and ensure the peace is maintained. In this vibrant and dynamic setting, Aemreh Ozpin finds herself navigating the challenges of being a unique and powerful individual. Surrounded by fellow students, some with extraordinary abilities of their own, Aemreh strives to find her place and purpose within the academy and the larger Kingdom of Vale. As she interacts with her friends, instructors, and the world around her, Aemreh embarks on a journey of self-discovery, uncovering the depths of her magical abilities and the responsibilities that come with them."},{"prompt":"summarize the following: US inflation sharply cooled last month, offering fresh hope that the Federal Reserve can soon wrap up the most aggressive interest-rate hikes in decades. The consumer price index rose 3% last month from a year ago, the smallest advance in more than two years, according to data out Wednesday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI — which economists view as the better indicator of underlying inflation — advanced 4.8%, also the lowest since 2021. Both measures climbed 0.2% from May, less than economists expected. Treasury yields plummeted, the S&P 500 opened higher and the dollar slid following the report. The chances of an additional Fed rate increase after this month slipped to well below 50%. The figures underscore the progress of reducing price pressures since inflation peaked a year ago, aided by more than a year of interest-rate hikes and easing demand. Even so, price pressures are running well above the Fed’s target and will keep policymakers inclined to resume raising interest rates at their July 25-26 meeting. WATCH: US CPI rose 3% last month from a year ago, while core CPI advanced 4.8%, the lowest since late 2021. Michael McKee breaks down the numbers. “Inflation is too high. Our target’s 2%,” Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said at an event Wednesday after the report. “If you back off too soon, inflation comes back strong, which then requires the Fed to do even more.”","completion":"US inflation has slowed down significantly, giving hope that the Federal Reserve can soon end its aggressive interest rate hikes.

The gauge rose 4% from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the end of 2021, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data published Wednesday. Fed officials are widely expected to resume interest-rate increases at their upcoming July 25-26 policy meeting. But slowing core services inflation, along with other lower-than-expected readings in the June data, could sway policymakers away from additional tightening in the months ahead. Read More: US Inflation Cools Sharply, Offering Hope Fed Can Wrap Up Hikes At a press conference following their meeting last month, Powell told reporters “we see only the earliest signs of disinflation” in core services prices, adding that “many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor-market conditions.” On a monthly basis, core services prices were unchanged in June — the first time since September 2021 that they haven’t risen. A similar gauge that also excludes medical care services, which have been affected in recent months by changes in health-insurer profits, was also flat on a monthly basis. That calculation is more consistent with the inflation gauge the Fed officially targets, which is based on the prices of personal consumption expenditures and isn’t affected by health-insurer margins.","completion":"US services prices, excluding housing and energy, increased at the slowest rate in 18 months in June.

The so-called core measure of the consumer price index — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — advanced 4.8% from a year earlier, data out Wednesday showed. That was the smallest increase since late 2021 and could give the Fed room to pause rate increases after its July meeting if the trend continues, economists say. But Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the growth in US consumer prices is still too quick even as it slowed in June, reiterating the central bank’s commitment to restoring inflation to its 2% goal. “Inflation is too high,” Barkin said Wednesday in Arnold, Maryland. “If you back off too soon, inflation comes back strong, which then requires the Fed to do even more.” The consumer price index rose 3% in June from a year earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The report offered welcome news for policymakers who have been bearing down on price pressures. Continued relief in the core services categories — watched closely by Fed officials — could give them flexibility to pause or potentially halt rate hikes after this month, economists say. “I definitely think that what we’re seeing today supports this slower pace of tightening,” said Gregory Daco, chief economist for EY, adding that the report showed a decline in airfare, hotel prices and housing costs. As inflation eases, that will also make real interest rates more restrictive and could lessen the need for further increases after this month, Daco said. “In our opinion, this is the last rate hike of this cycle,” Daco said of the rate increase expected when officials gather on July 25 and 26. The majority of Fed officials see interest rates moving higher this year to deal with a slower-than-expected cooling of price pressures and a persistently strong labor market. The Fed held policy rates steady last month, signaling a slower pace for rate moves to evaluate how the economy was responding to 10 straight increases and March’s banking turmoil. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month he wasn’t ruling out two consecutive hikes this year from the current range of 5% to 5.25%. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said separately that banks must be prepared for higher interest rates in case policymakers need to lift rates further to combat entrenched inflation. WATCH: Kashkari says rates may need to go higher. Markets currently expect inflation and interest rates to fall, in which case bank balance-sheet pressures would likely ebb, Kashkari said. “However, if inflation proves to be more entrenched than expected, policy rates might need to go higher, which could further reduce asset prices, increasing pressure on banks,” he said in an essay published Wednesday. “In such a scenario, policymakers could be forced to choose between aggressively fighting inflation or supporting bank stability.”","completion":"Federal Reserve officials are likely to resume interest rate hikes this month after data revealed that although inflation cooled in June, it remains above the central bank's target.

U.S. shoppers have been waiting for the best possible deals and discounts as rising interest rates and food prices have led them to delay purchases of big-ticket items in recent months. Online sales for appliances jumped 37% compared to average daily sales in June, while sales of toys rose 27% on the first day of the sales event. Data firm Numerator said the average Prime Day spend per order rose to 56.64 from 53.14 a year ago. Adobe Digital Insights expects Amazon's event to rake in between 12 billion and 13 billion. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To add more customers, Amazon has partnered with travel booking site Priceline to offer discounts as U.S. consumers prioritize experiences over non-essential spending. In the weeks leading to Prime Day on July 11-12, members of the loyalty program were given access to \\"invite-only deals\\" where shoppers could request invites to specific products that they were looking to purchase on deals. Rival retailers, including Walmart (WMT.N), Target (TGT.N) and Best Buy (BBY.N), are also offering large discounts during the Prime Day week. Walmart is also using the week as a way to lure more customers to its subscription program Walmart+ by offering 50% discount on annual membership sign-ups.Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of retail at Salesforce, said that shoppers have now been conditioned to compare deals from various retailers during Prime Day week, meaning rising competition for Amazon. Garf said that although people are shopping online, retailers are seeing a drop in conversion rates -- the measure of consumers who visit a store compared to those who make purchases. \\"That's telling us is each visit is less profitable,\\" Garf said. Amazon offered steep discounts to \\"positively influence\\" membership sign ups when Prime Day launched in 2015 and now Walmart is \\"taking a page out of the Amazon playbook,\\" he said. Prime Day week deals aren't \\"just about the initial sale and providing a discount, but it's Walmart and others looking to gain new customers and turning them into strong lifetime value of those customers,\\" Garf said. International Council of Shopping Centers Chief Executive Tom McGee said that deal events like Prime Day, Walmart+ Week and Target Deal days \\"drive spending across the board, including at both small and large retailers.\\" Shoppers can find the biggest discount across retailers of 16% on electronics on Wednesday. Apparel is discounted at 13%, while toys would be 15% cheaper, according to Adobe Digital Insights. Adobe's Pandey said Prime Day is a chance to stock up on back to-school items, especially apparel and electronics, whose sales were up 26% and 12%, respectively, compared to average daily sales in June. Data from Deloitte showed 69% of shoppers planned to rely on Prime Day sale for back-to-school purchases. But that spending is expected to decline for the first time in nine years as sticky inflation hurts non-essential purchases, it said. Adobe's data relies on direct consumer transactions based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites. Meanwhile, nearly 900 Amazon workers at a warehouse in Coventry, Britain, are striking over a pay dispute for three days from July 11-13, coinciding with the Prime Day sales event.

The humor lies in imagining mint's enthusiastic attempt to cross-breed with the newcomer, emphasizing its pronounced tendency to spread and take over gardens. 2. Blackberries waging territorial wars: This statement focuses on blackberries, specifically the invasive species known as Himalayan blackberry (Rubus armeniacus). These plants have a robust growth habit and can become quite invasive, forming dense, impenetrable thickets. The meme humorously suggests that if an extraterrestrial plant arrived, blackberries would fiercely defend their territory, as if engaging in a \\"war\\" over the available space. 3. Kudzu swarming, scorched earth style: Kudzu (Pueraria lobata) is an extremely invasive vine notorious for its rapid growth and ability to smother other plants by overwhelming or \\"swarming\\" them. The phrase \\"scorched earth style\\" implies that if an extraterrestrial plant were to arrive, kudzu would aggressively expand and overtake everything in its path, leaving behind an almost barren or \\"scorched\\" landscape. It adds an element of humor based on the invasive nature of kudzu and its potential to dominate other plants. Overall, this meme combines exaggerated descriptions of specific plants' behaviors and characteristics with the imagined scenario of encountering an extraterrestrial plant, resulting in a humorous and lighthearted take on the interactions between different species."},{"prompt":"Name: Diabe Smasher Age: 16 Occupation: Student at Beacon Academy, Protector of Vale Kingdom Role: Adopted older brother of Aemreh Ozpin Appearance: Diabe Smasher is a 16-year-old male Faunus with distinct wolf features.

She’s around 20-22 years old now, and is in the middle of budding. And due to her choice of clothing being a bikini, her bump was visible - and the two small Magma Cubes developing inside were visible due to Jennifer’s skin being gelatinous. But both of the small Magma Cubes - which were going to be born female - were also budding, and the tiny Magma Cubes developing inside were also visible due to both of the small Magma Cubes having gelatinous skin.)

Unlike dynamic drivers or balanced armature drivers, which are more commonly found in consumer audio devices, electrostatic drivers utilize a different operating principle. In an electrostatic driver, there are two main components: a thin diaphragm and a stationary stator. The diaphragm is usually made of a lightweight material such as a film or a stretched conductive material, while the stator consists of fixed perforated plates with an electrostatic charge. When an audio signal is applied to the stator, the charged plates alternate voltage, creating an electrostatic field that interacts with the diaphragm. As the audio signal's electrical charge changes, the diaphragm is attracted or repelled by the electrostatic field, which causes it to vibrate and produce sound waves. This vibration generates highly accurate and detailed sound reproduction, especially in the mid and high-frequency ranges where electrostatic drivers excel. They are renowned for their exceptional clarity, transparency, and low distortion characteristics. However, electrostatic drivers have some unique requirements and considerations: - They require an external energizer or amplifier to supply high voltage and bias the stator plates. - The energizer unit typically needs to be larger and bulkier compared to typical headphone amplifiers. - Electrostatic drivers are more commonly found in high-end audio systems, making them relatively expensive compared to other driver technologies. - Due to their design and construction, electrostatic drivers are generally not suitable for portable or on-the-go use. Overall, electrostatic drivers are highly regarded for their exceptional sound quality, accurate reproduction, and low distortion characteristics, but they may require specific equipment and are often found in higher-end audio setups rather than mainstream consumer devices."},{"prompt":"which is better out of the three, a balanced armature, a dynamic driver, or a electrostatic driver, in terms of their sound reproduction","completion":"The question of which driver technology is better, whether a balanced armature, dynamic driver, or electrostatic driver, in terms of sound reproduction is highly subjective and depends on personal preferences and the specific implementation of the drivers.

They may push me to the shadows, With their unjust and biased ways, But I rise above their shallow blows, With resilience that never sways. For I am a creator, a shining light, With talents that can't be denied, My voice echoes through darkest night, A beacon of strength and pride. I, too, am America's dream, The embodiment of liberty and grace, With every step, I fiercely gleam, I claim my space in this blessed place. So, hear me now, loud and clear, I, too, am part of this land, And with each passing year, My presence, they shall understand."},{"prompt":"Ctreate a poem like The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost","completion":"The Path Untrodden Two paths diverged within the wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, as I stood Lost in thoughts, my heart seeking growth. One path appeared, well-worn, well-tried, A common route for all to take, But deep inside, my heart defied, Yearning for a choice that makes me wake. The other path, less traveled by, Overgrown, untamed, and wild, Whispered secrets, promising to fly, Adventure and discovery reconciled. I paused, my eyes swept both afar, Considering where my steps would lead, Yet knowing deep within my heart, To take a risk, was what I truly need. So I ventured forth on the path unknown, With hopes and dreams my guiding light, Embracing challenges, I've grown, In this untrodden realm, I find my might. Years will pass, and stories make, Of the choice that shaped my soul, To deviate from the common sake, To forge my own path, and make it whole. And that has made all the difference, The road I took, not the one well-trod, A life lived with fierce independence, An inspired journey, guided by God."},{"prompt":"Create a poem similar to The Road Not Taken written by Robert Frost","completion":"The Journey Unchosen Two roads stretched out before my weary sight, And deep within, a choice I had to make, To tread a path familiar and bright, Or venture into the unknown for my own sake. The first road beckoned, well-paved and clear, A path well-traveled by countless feet, Security whispered, banishing fear, Promising solace, comfort, and ease. Yet the other road, less defined and rough, Lured me with an allure that I couldn't deny, Adventure whispered, mystical and tough, Inviting me to cast my fears aside. In contemplation, I stood, hesitant and still, Considering the outcomes of my choice, The known or the unknown, my heart's will, Guiding me with an inner voice. I chose the road less traveled, embraced the unknown, With trembling steps, I ventured into the wild, With each stride, uncertainty had grown, Yet exhilaration accompanied every mile. For that choice, I reached heights I never knew, Glimpsing vistas I once only dreamed held, Through mountains and valleys, I journeyed through, A life of wonder, where my spirit swelled. So, when I look back at the path not taken, I don't question the choices I've made, For in the road less traveled, I've awakened, Living a life filled with memories and accolades. Remember, dear traveler, as you embark, The choices you make shape your tale, Embrace the road that ignites your spark, And leave behind the worries that may assail. For life is an adventure, a winding road, With opportunities waiting to be found, Choose the path that speaks to your soul, And let your heart's desires resound."},{"prompt":"Create a quiz for 5th grade students that testa Word Patterns, Syllabication and Multisyllabic words- From this word list, ask students to Find Similar Word Patterns and Multisyllabic words in additional set of words in a multiple choice quiz. 1. depend-dependable: 2.manage- manageable: 3.understand- understandable: 4.

She’s around 20-22 years old now, and is in the middle of budding. And due to her choice of clothing being a bikini, her bump was visible - and the two small Magma Cubes developing inside were visible due to Jennifer’s skin being gelatinous. But both of the small Magma Cubes - which were going to be born female - were also budding, and the tiny Magma Cubes developing inside were also visible due to both of the small Magma Cubes having gelatinous skin.) Jennifer: “Hi, [player]! Look - my babies’ babies are kicking!” [player]: “Jennifer! It’s so good to see you. Wow, your babies’ babies are kicking? That’s incredible! How are you feeling? Is there anything I can do to help?” Jennifer: “I’m feeling a mixture of excitement and nervousness. It’s my first time experiencing this, you know? But overall, I’m doing well. Thank you for asking. As for help, I appreciate the offer. Just having some company and someone to talk to would be great.” [player]: “Of course, I’ll be here for you every step of the way. It must be quite the unique experience, witnessing the birth of new Magma Cubes. Is there anything you need in terms of supplies or any special care?” Jennifer: “Thank you, [player]. I’m lucky to have you as a friend. In terms of supplies, I could use some extra heat sources to keep the temperature comfortable for my babies. Magma Cubes thrive in warm environments, and I want to make sure they have the best conditions possible. Other than that, maybe some soothing gel or ointment for my skin. It can get a bit dry and irritated during the budding process.” [player]: “Consider it done, Jennifer. I’ll gather the necessary heat sources and find some soothing gel for you. How about I prepare a cozy area nearby where you can rest and take care of yourself? We can make it as warm and comfortable as possible for you and your little ones.” Jennifer: “That would be amazing, [player]. You always know how to make me feel comfortable. I appreciate your support more than words can express. Let’s create a cozy spot where we can spend time together and watch the miraculous process of life unfold.” [player]: “Absolutely, Jennifer. We’ll make it a special place for both of us. Your journey as a mother is truly extraordinary, and I’m honored to be a part of it. Let’s make some special memories during this unique time.” (Together, [player] and Jennifer create a warm and cozy area near the base. They gather heat sources, provide soothing gel, and create a comfortable space for Jennifer to rest and nurture her Magma Cube babies.) Jennifer: “Thank you so much, [player]. This means the world to me. I couldn’t ask for a better friend. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me and my little ones.” [player]: “The future is bright, Jennifer. I have a feeling that your babies will grow up to be incredible Magma Cubes, just like their mother. I’ll be by your side, supporting you every step of the way. Together, we’ll make sure your babies have everything they need to thrive.” (With a smile, Jennifer settles into the cozy area, feeling loved and supported by her friend. As the days go by, the small Magma Cubes continue to grow inside her, gaining strength and vitality.

It returns an HRESULT, which is a standardized way of indicating success or failure of a function call in Windows programming. The Compress function takes several parameters: - pBufferIn: A pointer to the input buffer that contains the uncompressed data. - cbBufferIn: The size, in bytes, of the input buffer. - pBufferOut: A pointer to the output buffer where the compressed data will be written. - cbBufferOut: The size, in bytes, of the output buffer. - pcbFinal: A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the compressed data written to the output buffer. This parameter can be NULL if the size information is not needed. The function compresses the data in the input buffer and writes the compressed data to the output buffer. The compressed data may be smaller or larger than the original data, depending on the compression algorithm used and the nature of the data. The HRESULT returned by the Compress function indicates the success or failure of the compression operation. A value of S_OK indicates success, while other values indicate failure or specific error conditions. Some common error codes that may be returned include E_INVALIDARG (indicating invalid input parameters), E_OUTOFMEMORY (indicating insufficient memory), and E_FAIL (indicating a general failure). To handle the returned HRESULT, you can use the SUCCEEDED() macro to check if the function call was successful, and the FAILED() macro to check if it failed. If the function call failed, you can use the HRESULT error code to determine the specific reason for the failure and take appropriate action. Overall, the Compress function is a useful tool for compressing data in C++ using the Windows API, and the HRESULT returned by the function provides information about the success or failure of the compression operation."},{"prompt":"用中文回答","completion":"Compress函数是C++中使用Windows API来压缩数据的一个函数。它返回一个HRESULT，这是Windows编程中用来表示函数调用成功或失败的标准化方式。 Compress函数接受多个参数： - pBufferIn：指向包含未压缩数据的输入缓冲区的指针。 - cbBufferIn：输入缓冲区的大小（以字节为单位）。 - pBufferOut：指向压缩数据将被写入的输出缓冲区的指针。 - cbBufferOut：输出缓冲区的大小（以字节为单位）。 - pcbFinal：接收压缩数据写入输出缓冲区的大小（以字节为单位）的变量的指针。如果不需要大小信息，则此参数可以为NULL。 该函数将压缩输入缓冲区中的数据，并将压缩数据写入输出缓冲区。压缩数据的大小可能比原始数据要大或小，这取决于所使用的压缩算法和数据的性质。 Compress函数返回的HRESULT表示压缩操作的成功或失败。S_OK表示成功，而其他值表示失败或特定的错误条件。一些常见的错误代码包括E_INVALIDARG（表示输入参数无效），E_OUTOFMEMORY（表示内存不足）和E_FAIL（表示一般性失败）。 为了处理返回的HRESULT，可以使用SUCCEEDED()宏来检查函数调用是否成功，使用FAILED()宏来检查是否失败。如果函数调用失败，可以使用HRESULT错误代码来确定失败的具体原因，并采取适当的措施。 总的来说，Compress函数是使用Windows API在C++中压缩数据的一个有用工具，而返回的HRESULT提供了关于压缩操作成功或失败的信息。"},{"prompt":"爬虫xpath find element by title","completion":"To find an element by its title using XPath in Python for web scraping, you can use the following code: \`\`\`python import requests from lxml import html # Make a request to the website response = requests.get('http://example.com') # Parse the HTML content tree = html.fromstring(response.content) # Find elements by title attribute elements = tree.xpath(\\"//[@title='Your Title']\\") # Print the elements found for element in elements: print(element.text) \`\`\` Replace \`'http://example.com'\` with the actual URL of the website you want to scrape.

Here's a step-by-step guide to migrating your applications and data from on-premises to the cloud using the mentioned AWS services: 1. Assess your application and data: Analyze your current on-premises infrastructure, applications, and data requirements. Identify the dependencies, performance requirements, and any necessary changes needed for migration. 2. Create the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to create a virtual network in the cloud. Set up a VPC that represents your on-premises network architecture, including subnets, route tables, security groups, and network ACLs. 3. Provision EC2 instances: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. Provision EC2 instances based on your application requirements. You can select the instance type, operating system, and other configuration settings. 4. Migrate data to Amazon S3: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data. Use AWS Snowball or other data transfer methods to transfer your on-premises data to Amazon S3 buckets. Categorize the data and define appropriate access controls. 5. Set up AWS Lambda functions: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Identify the functions in your existing on-premises applications that can be moved to AWS Lambda. Adapt and refactor the code if necessary before deploying it as Lambda functions. 6. Integrate EC2 instances with VPC: Connect your EC2 instances with the VPC to enable secure communication within the cloud environment. Use VPC peering or VPN connections to establish connectivity from your on-premises environment to the VPC. 7. Modify applications for scalability: Modify your applications to take advantage of the scalability provided by AWS services. Use Auto Scaling to automatically scale your EC2 instances based on demand and Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. 8. Archive data using Amazon Glacier: Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and cost-effective cloud storage service for long-term data archiving. Implement an archival strategy to move infrequently accessed data from S3 to Glacier, reducing storage costs. 9. Test and validate: Carry out thorough testing and validation of your migrated applications and data to ensure they function correctly in the new cloud environment. Perform load testing, security testing, and integration testing to identify any issues or optimizations that may be required. 10. Cut over to the cloud: Once you are confident in the stability and performance of your cloud-based applications and data, plan for a cut-over from on-premises to the cloud. Redirect the necessary DNS records, update configurations, and monitor the migration process. It's important to note that each migration is unique, and you may need to tailor the steps according to your specific requirements. Also, consider using AWS Migration Hub and other migration tools provided by AWS to simplify the migration process and track the progress."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Fantastic!

Uzo described her character Edie as a Black woman who worked as a drug inspector and was skeptical of the opioid epidemic to the Sackler family.","completion":"Interviewer: Thank you all for joining me today. Let's dive right in. Uzo, could you tell us more about your character, Edie, and how she fits into the narrative of Painkiller? Uzo Aduba: Absolutely! Edie is a drug inspector who brings a unique perspective to the opioid epidemic. As a Black woman in a predominantly white industry, she faces skepticism and discrimination when expressing her doubts about the crisis to the Sackler family. Edie represents a voice that is often marginalized, but her skepticism and perseverance play a crucial role in uncovering the truth behind the crisis. Interviewer: That sounds like a challenging and important role, Uzo. Matthew, how did you approach your portrayal of Richard Sackler, considering his controversial role in the opioid crisis? Matthew Broderick: Richard Sackler is undoubtedly a complex character. It was important for me to humanize him while also acknowledging the damage caused by his actions. I tried to delve into the psychology of someone driven by ambition and the desire to protect his family's legacy. It was a delicate balance, but I hope viewers will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding his involvement. Interviewer: Sam, you play Raymond Sackler, Richard's father. What can you share about your experience with portraying such a pivotal character? Sam Anderson: Portraying Raymond Sackler was a tremendous responsibility. I delved into his background, motivations, and ultimately his complicity in the crisis that unfolded. It was essential for me to bring authenticity to his character, exploring the dynamics between father and son within this troubling context. Raymond's presence in the series offers a lens into the foundations of the Sackler empire. Interviewer: Tyler, your character, John Brownlee, faces the challenges of the pharmaceutical industry. Can you tell us more about his journey? Tyler Ritter: Absolutely. John Brownlee is a character navigating the morally gray landscape of the pharmaceutical industry. Initially, he finds himself caught between his ambition and his own reservations about the opioid crisis. Throughout the series, John undergoes a gradual awakening, prompting him to question his own involvement and the role that he plays. It was fascinating to explore his growth and transformation. Interviewer: Thank you all for sharing your insights into your characters' roles. Now, as actors portraying these complex figures, what were some of the challenges you faced during the filming process? Matthew Broderick: One of the challenges was humanizing a character who had caused so much harm. It's always difficult to approach an individual who has contributed to such a devastating crisis. Additionally, playing a character based on real people adds another layer of responsibility. Uzo Aduba: For me, it was important to bring authenticity to Edie's experiences and to channel the skepticism she faced as a Black woman in a predominantly white industry. I wanted to honor the challenges she confronted while also showcasing her resilience and determination. Sam Anderson: Understanding the world of the Sackler family and delving into the dynamics of power and wealth were some of the challenges I faced. It required careful research and collaboration with the creators and the other cast members to ensure an accurate portrayal. Tyler Ritter: I echo what my fellow cast members have said. Additionally, capturing the internal struggle of John Brownlee as he grasps the weight of the opioid crisis was a challenge. Finding the balance between his ambition and his moral compass was both daunting and rewarding. Interviewer: It's evident that you all put a tremendous amount of thought and research into your roles. Lastly, what do you hope viewers take away from watching the Painkiller miniseries? Matthew Broderick: I hope that viewers gain a deeper understanding of the opioid crisis and the role of corporate greed in perpetuating it. I also hope that it prompts discussions about accountability and inspires individuals to take action. Uzo Aduba: Absolutely. I hope viewers are compelled to take a closer look at the narratives surrounding addiction, emphasizing the importance of listening to marginalized voices and challenging the status quo. Sam Anderson: I hope the series encourages viewers to examine the systemic issues that allowed the crisis to occur in the first place. By shedding light on the origins of the epidemic, we can work towards preventing similar tragedies in the future. Tyler Ritter: Agreed. The series aims to raise awareness and prompt conversations about the opioid crisis. I hope viewers come away with a sense of the human toll it has taken and the collective responsibility to find sustainable solutions.

В данной статье мы рассмотрим 5 главных признаков, на которые следует обратить внимание при определении созревания чеснока на грядке. 1. Цвет луковицы: Один из самых очевидных признаков созревания чеснока - это изменение цвета его луковицы. Начальные луковицы могут быть белыми, но по мере созревания они постепенно приобретают шкалу оттенков - от кремового и розового до ярко-фиолетового или бордового. Полностью созревший чеснок имеет насыщенный и равномерный цвет луковицы. 2. Структура и состояние оболочки: Важным признаком созревания является состояние оболочки чеснока. Когда чеснок созревает, его оболочка становится всё более слоистой и тонкой, что позволяет отличить его от молодого или несозревшего чеснока. В случае полного созревания, оболочка легко отделяется и имеет глянцевую поверхность. 3. Стебли и листья: Во время созревания чеснока, стебли и листья начинают пожелтеть и постепенно отмирать. Это естественное явление, и указывает на то, что чеснок готов для сбора. Созревший чеснок обладает золотисто-желтыми стеблями и сухими листьями. 4. Размер луковиц: Размер луковицы также является надежным признаком созревания. В процессе созревания, луковица постепенно увеличивается в размерах и становится компактной и плотной. Небольшой и плоский чеснок часто свидетельствует о том, что он не достиг полного созревания и нуждается в дополнительной выдержке на грядке. 5. Запах чеснока: Наконец, запах чеснока - это один из основных способов определения его созревания. Полностью созревший чеснок обладает сильным и выразительным ароматом, который часто можно почувствовать даже при небольшом приближении к нему. Учитывая эти 5 главных признаков созревания чеснока на грядке, вы сможете определить момент полного созревания овоща и собирать его вовремя, чтобы насладиться вкусом и ароматом свежего чеснока. Необходимо помнить, что обладание этими знаниями поможет вам выращивать и использовать чеснок в его наивысшем качестве."},{"prompt":"实体渠道移动业务发展用户数分析结果如下： 实体渠道移动业务发展用户数累计：235.7万，最新账期数据为：52.57万，环比下降，同比下降。 其中：2023年05月广东、山东、河南三市整体居前，分别是：33.19万、21.66万、17.55万。海南、青海、西藏居后。 以下为相关指标的分析情况：宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数： 宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数累计：19.16万，最新账期数据为：4.19万，环比下降，同比下降。 其中：2023年05月河南、湖南、辽宁三市整体居前，分别是：3.7万、1.65万、1.63万。江西、云南、海南居后。 农村市场移动业务发展用户数： 农村市场移动业务发展用户数累计：101.91万，最新账期数据为：21.7万，环比下降，同比下降。 其中：2023年05月河南、浙江、山东三市整体居前，分别是：10.69万、9.21万、8.9万。海南、甘肃、西藏居后。 对以上数据进行总结及分析，并格式化输出","completion":"根据数据统计，实体渠道移动业务发展用户数累计为235.7万。最新账期数据为52.57万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。在具体地区分布方面，2023年05月广东、山东、河南三市的用户数位居前列，分别为33.19万、21.66万、17.55万，而海南、青海、西藏的用户数相对较少。 针对宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数，累计数量为19.16万，最新账期数据为4.19万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。在具体地区分布方面，2023年05月河南、湖南、辽宁三市的用户数位居前列，分别为3.7万、1.65万、1.63万，而江西、云南、海南的用户数相对较少。 农村市场移动业务发展用户数累计为101.91万，最新账期数据为21.7万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。在具体地区分布方面，2023年05月河南、浙江、山东三市的用户数位居前列，分别为10.69万、9.21万、8.9万，而海南、甘肃、西藏的用户数相对较少。 综上所述，实体渠道移动业务发展用户数、宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数和农村市场移动业务发展用户数均呈现下降趋势。其中，广东、山东、河南在实体渠道移动业务发展用户数方面居前，河南、湖南、辽宁在宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数方面居前，河南、浙江、山东在农村市场移动业务发展用户数方面居前。海南、青海、西藏在实体渠道移动业务发展用户数方面居后，江西、云南、海南在宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数方面居后，海南、甘肃、西藏在农村市场移动业务发展用户数方面居后。请参考以上数据分析结果。"},{"prompt":"再换个方式呢","completion":"根据数据统计，以下是对实体渠道移动业务发展用户数、宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数和农村市场移动业务发展用户数的总结和分析： 实体渠道移动业务发展用户数： - 累计用户数为235.7万，最新账期数据为52.57万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。 - 在2023年05月，广东、山东、河南三市的用户数居前，分别为33.19万、21.66万、17.55万。 - 海南、青海和西藏的用户数相对较少。 宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数： - 累计用户数为19.16万，最新账期数据为4.19万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。 - 在2023年05月，河南、湖南、辽宁三市的用户数居前，分别为3.7万、1.65万、1.63万。 - 江西、云南和海南的用户数相对较少。 农村市场移动业务发展用户数： - 累计用户数为101.91万，最新账期数据为21.7万，环比和同比均呈下降趋势。 - 在2023年05月，河南、浙江、山东三市的用户数居前，分别为10.69万、9.21万、8.9万。 - 海南、甘肃和西藏的用户数相对较少。 综上所述，总体而言，实体渠道移动业务发展、宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展以及农村市场移动业务发展的用户数均呈下降趋势。其中，广东、山东、河南在实体渠道移动业务发展用户数方面居前，河南、湖南、辽宁在宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数方面居前，河南、浙江、山东在农村市场移动业务发展用户数方面居前。海南、青海、西藏在实体渠道移动业务发展用户数方面居后，江西、云南、海南在宽移融合发展套餐捆绑的移动业务发展用户数方面居后，海南、甘肃、西藏在农村市场移动业务发展用户数方面居后。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Synergistic effect of hydrophilic polyglycerol fatty acid esters and protein on the stability of interfacial membrane in low-fat aerated emulsions with different homogenization conditions","completion":"The stability of interfacial membranes in low-fat aerated emulsions can be influenced by various factors, including the roughness of the surface, interfacial properties, viscoelastic structure, and binding energy. Additionally, there may be a synergistic effect of hydrophilic polyglycerol fatty acid esters and protein on the stability of interfacial membranes. The roughness of the surface plays a crucial role in the stability of interfacial membranes. A rough surface can provide more area for the formation of interfacial membranes, leading to improved stability. It can also offer better adhesion and reduce the possibility of detachment under different conditions. Interfacial properties, such as the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the surface, can affect the stability of interfacial membranes. Hydrophobic surfaces tend to promote the formation of stable interfacial membranes due to better interactions between the hydrophobic tails of the interfacial molecules. On the other hand, hydrophilic surfaces may result in weaker interfacial membranes and increased chances of detachment. The viscoelastic structure of the interfacial membranes is another essential factor for stability. A viscoelastic structure provides mechanical strength and flexibility to the interfacial membranes, preventing their rupture or detachment. This property is particularly important in low-fat aerated emulsions, where emulsion droplets are subjected to forces during mixing, pumping, or other processing steps. The binding energy between the interfacial molecules and the continuous phase also influences the stability of interfacial membranes. Stronger binding energy can enhance the resistance of interfacial membranes against disruption or detachment. In low-fat aerated emulsions, the addition of hydrophilic polyglycerol fatty acid esters and protein can have a synergistic effect on the stability of interfacial membranes. These components can interact with each other and form a complex network at the interface, leading to improved stability. The polyglycerol fatty acid esters can provide a hydrophilic surface, promoting the formation of stable interfacial membranes. Protein, on the other hand, can contribute to the viscoelastic structure and enhance the binding energy between the interfacial molecules and the continuous phase. The stability of interfacial membranes in low-fat aerated emulsions can be further affected by the homogenization conditions. Homogenization plays a crucial role in creating and stabilizing small emulsion droplets, as well as developing the interfacial structures. Different homogenization conditions, such as pressure, temperature, and number of passes, can influence the size and properties of the interfacial membranes and, consequently, the stability of the emulsion. In summary, the stability of interfacial membranes in low-fat aerated emulsions is determined by various factors, including the roughness of the surface, interfacial properties, viscoelastic structure, and binding energy. The synergistic effect of hydrophilic polyglycerol fatty acid esters and protein can enhance the stability of interfacial membranes. Additionally, the homogenization conditions can also play a significant role in determining the stability of the emulsion."},{"prompt":"rough surface; interfacial properties; viscoelastic structure; binding energy.

Be creative.","completion":"1. Soul Drain: Using this skill drains the demon lord's own life force, causing them to lose a percentage of their maximum health after each use. 2. Corrupted Magic: Skills used by the demon lord have a chance to backfire, causing unintended consequences or even harming the demon lord themselves. 3. Infernal Rebirth: Upon using this skill, the demon lord loses all accumulated experience points and reverts to a lower level. This represents the demon lord's willingness to sacrifice power for resurrection. 4. Demonic Agony: After using powerful skills, the demon lord experiences intense pain and is temporarily stunned, leaving them vulnerable to attacks. 5. Soul Tether: Using this skill allows the demon lord to tether their soul to a target, increasing damage done to the target but also increasing damage taken by the demon lord for a limited time. 6. Dark Pact: Each time the demon lord uses this skill, they must sacrifice a portion of their own stats or attributes, temporarily weakening themselves to gain additional power. 7. Chaotic Rift: This skill causes a portal to open, bringing in powerful demonic entities to aid the demon lord. However, the summoned demons are not under the complete control of the demon lord, and they may turn against them if not careful. 8. Abyssal Embrace: After using this skill, the demon lord is engulfed in darkness for a period of time, impairing their vision and reducing their accuracy in combat. 9. Forbidden Knowledge: Certain skills require the demon lord to gain temporary access to ancient and forbidden knowledge. However, the process of acquiring this knowledge has a chance of corrupting their mind, leading to temporary insanity or confusion during battles. 10. Cursed Aura: Using certain skills activates a cursed aura around the demon lord, causing nearby allies to take increased damage for a short period of time. This reflects the demonic influence spreading and negatively affecting those around the demon lord."},{"prompt":"Be more creative and detailed.","completion":"Certainly! Here are more creative and detailed drawbacks for the Demon Lord's skills: 1. Blood Pact: In order to activate this skill, the Demon Lord must sacrifice the life force of one of their loyal minions. This sacrifice permanently decreases the maximum health of the Demon Lord, representing the toll it takes on their own vitality. 2. Mark of Damnation: After using this skill, the Demon Lord becomes marked by dark forces. This mark attracts powerful bounty hunters or other players seeking rewards for the slaying of powerful foes, making the Demon Lord a prime target until the mark fades. 3. Demonic Possession: When utilizing this skill, the Demon Lord allows a powerful demon spirit to possess them temporarily. While possessing enhanced abilities, the demon spirit may gradually take control of the character, forcing the player to fight for control or risking losing their character permanently. 4. Voidwalk: Using this skill allows the Demon Lord to teleport instantly across great distances. However, each teleportation drains a fragment of their soul, diminishing their overall power. If enough fragments are lost, the Demon Lord may permanently lose access to certain abilities or skills. 5. Sacrificial Ritual: This skill allows the Demon Lord to summon a devastating army of demons. However, the ritual requires the Demon Lord to offer a sacrifice of a captured player from their own faction, leading to faction reputation loss and potential betrayal from their own followers. 6. Demonic Instability: Certain skill combinations can trigger a state of demonic instability, causing the Demon Lord to temporarily lose control of their abilities. During this time, their skills may randomly backfire, hitting unintended targets or causing adverse effects on themselves or allies. 7. Cursed Grimoire: To access powerful dark spells, the Demon Lord relies on a cursed grimoire. However, each time a spell is cast from this book, the curses within become more potent. Eventually, the Demon Lord may become permanently cursed, suffering debilitating effects until a certain condition or quest is completed. 8. Abyssal Backlash: While using certain high-damaging skills, the Demon Lord may inadvertently open a portal to the Abyss, releasing chaotic energies that lash out at everything nearby. This puts both enemies and allies in danger, requiring careful positioning and timing. 9. Eternal Hunger: Certain forbidden skills allow the Demon Lord to consume the souls of defeated enemies, gaining temporary power boosts. However, if they are unable to consume enough souls within a specific time frame, their powers will drain away instead, leaving them weakened and vulnerable. 10. Dreadful Shackles: To harness the full potential of their demonic powers, the Demon Lord must constantly wear cursed shackles. These shackles limit their movement speed and agility, making them slower and less maneuverable in combat. Removing the shackles, though tempting, may unleash uncontrollable chaotic energy."},{"prompt":"More that don't have a permanent effect.","completion":"Certainly! Here are additional drawbacks for the Demon Lord's skills that do not have permanent effects: 1. Sinful Exhaustion: Each time the Demon Lord uses powerful skills, they experience intense exhaustion, temporarily reducing their overall stamina and movement speed for a period of time. This drawback represents the toll that harnessing demonic powers takes on their physical capabilities. 2. Fiery Aftermath: When using fire-based skills, flames linger around the Demon Lord for a limited duration. These flames cause continuous damage to the Demon Lord, slowly depleting their health until the flames naturally extinguish, adding an element of risk and strategy to the skill's usage. 3. Dark Shroud: Activating certain skills envelops the Demon Lord in a dense, impenetrable shadow. While concealed, the Demon Lord is unable to directly see or target enemies, relying solely on their instincts or the actions of their allies for guidance. 4. Infernal Reflection: After using reflection-based skills, the Demon Lord becomes vulnerable to their own reflected attacks. If hit by their own reflected projectiles or spells, they suffer double the damage, emphasizing caution and precision when utilizing this skill. 5. Demonic Agony: Some skills trigger excruciating pain within the Demon Lord's body as the demonic energies surge through them. This pain temporarily disrupts their concentration and accuracy, causing a reduction in critical hit chance or precision for a short duration. 6. Maleficent Bindings: When certain crowd-control skills are used, the Demon Lord's movements become slowed and their agility is hindered for a period of time. This drawback represents the cost of extending their will over others, temporarily decreasing their own physical prowess. 7. Essence Drain: Skills that drain the life force from enemies also absorb a portion of the Demon Lord's own vitality. This temporary loss of health can be overcome by defeating more enemies or by using restorative spells or abilities. 8. Unstable Conjuring: Skills that conjure demonic minions or weapons create temporary weaknesses within the space-time fabric. These weaknesses can result in unintended side effects or unpredictable behavior from the summoned entities, making each summon a potentially risky endeavor. 9. Chaotic Feedback: Certain skills tap into unstable demonic energies, resulting in spontaneous feedback that causes damage to the Demon Lord themselves. This damage may be minor or significant, depending on the skill level or power used. 10. Dreadful Backlash: In rare instances, when using powerful skills consecutively without allowing for recovery time, the Demon Lord's own dark essence begins to rebel. This rebellion manifests as uncontrollable burst damage that strikes the Demon Lord, momentarily stunning or incapacitating them."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Она богата витаминами, минералами и антиоксидантами, которые способствуют укреплению иммунной системы и поддержанию общего здоровья. Морковь также обладает приятным сладким вкусом и ярким оранжевым цветом, что делает ее привлекательной для различных блюд и напитков. В июле морковь находится в своем самом пиковом сезоне созревания. В это время она получает достаточно солнечного света и влаги для полного развития своих питательных веществ. Морковь предпочитает теплый и солнечный климат, поэтому июль - идеальное время для выращивания этого овоща. Она также не выносит сильной жары, поэтому проводит лето в достаточно комфортных условиях. Морковь любит обильный полив, особенно в жарких летних месяцах. Это помогает растению достичь наилучшего результата в хранении влаги и расти здоровой и сочной. Хрустящую текстуру и сочность моркови можно сохранить, уделяя особое внимание поливу. Регулярный полив также помогает предотвратить появление горького вкуса. Один из самых важных аспектов, которые морковь любит в июле, - это мульчирование почвы. Мульча помогает сохранить влагу и защищает растение от сорняков. Избыточные сорняки могут конкурировать с морковью за воду и питательные вещества, что может замедлить ее рост и развитие. Поэтому важно регулярно удалять сорняки и укрывать почву мульчей, чтобы предотвратить их появление. Удобрение также играет важную роль в развитии моркови в июле. Морковь требует достаточного количества питательных веществ, особенно азота, фосфора и калия. Регулярное внесение удобрений помогает обеспечить все необходимые компоненты для развития крепких и здоровых растений. Однако следует помнить, что избыток азота может способствовать образованию нежных и коротких корней, поэтому важно следить за правильной дозировкой удобрений. В июле морковь также уязвима перед некоторыми вредителями и болезнями. Одним из наиболее распространенных вредителей являются морковные листовертки и жук-точильщик. Они могут повредить листья и корни моркови. Чтобы предотвратить поражение моркови, рекомендуется регулярно осматривать растения и принимать меры для борьбы с вредителями в случае необходимости. В июле можно начинать собирать первые урожаи моркови. Обычно морковь достигает полной зрелости примерно через 70-80 дней после посадки семян. Правильное время для сбора моркови - когда корни достигли желаемого размера и насыщенного оранжевого цвета. Чтобы избежать повреждений корней, рекомендуется использовать рыхлительный инструмент, например вилку, при извлечении моркови из почвы. Итак, морковь любит июль за множество причин. В это время она получает достаточно солнечного света и влаги, что способствует полному развитию питательных веществ. Умеренный полив, мульчирование и регулярное внесение удобрений помогают создать идеальные условия для роста моркови. Однако необходимо также следить за вредителями и болезнями, которые могут повредить морковь. В июле можно начинать собирать первые урожаи моркови, наслаждаясь ее свежим сладким вкусом и ярким цветом."},{"prompt":"1. 数量エラー 一b/lは 2 コンテナのデータです NVCで登録する時、冷静に対処できず、 さらに、BIA搬入確認が個別搬入があって、COPY PASTE 間違いが発生しました。 定時に退勤しようと思っているので、 したがって、データがF１２送信する前に繰返確認が行われていません。 ミスを起こした。","completion":"2. 計算ミス 請求書の計算をするときに、誤った数字を使ってしまいました。 正しい計算をして再度請求書を作成する必要があります。 3. 通信エラー ファイルの送信中に通信エラーが発生し、データが正常に送信されませんでした。 再度送信を試みるか、別の方法でデータを転送する必要があります。 4. 機器故障 パソコンやプリンタなどの機器が故障し、作業が一時的に停止しました。 修理または代替機器の使用を考える必要があります。 5. 品質問題 製品の品質に問題があり、顧客からクレームが寄せられました。 問題の解決策を見つけるために速やかに対応する必要があります。 6. 連絡ミス 重要な連絡を途中で見落としてしまい、タスクの遅延や混乱が生じました。 確認プロセスを改善し、すべての連絡事項について確実に把握するようにする必要があります。 7. プログラムエラー 使用しているソフトウェアやアプリケーションにバグがあり、予期しないエラーが発生しました。 開発者に報告して修正を依頼し、作業を続ける必要があります。 8. 人為ミス 作業中にミスをしてしまい、他のスタッフや顧客に迷惑をかけました。 再度確認を行い、同じミスを繰り返さないようにするための予防措置が必要です。 9. 資材不足 必要な資材が不足しており、作業を継続することができません。 資材の追加発注や代替案の検討が必要です。 10. 締切遅れ タスクやプロジェクトの締切を守れず、スケジュールが遅れてしまいました。 原因の特定と改善策の検討が必要です。"},{"prompt":"文章の訂正 お願い","completion":"1. 数量エラー 1つのB/Lには2コンテナのデータが含まれています。 NVCで登録する際、冷静に対処することができず、さらに、BIA搬入確認において個別搬入があったため、COPY PASTEの間違いが発生しました。 定時に退勤する予定なので、データをF12送信する前に再度確認が行われていません。 ミスをしてしまいました。 2. 計算ミス 請求書の計算の際に、誤った数字を使用してしまいました。 正しい計算を行い、請求書を再作成する必要があります。 3. 通信エラー ファイルの送信中に通信エラーが発生し、データが正常に送信されませんでした。 再度送信を試みるか、別の方法でデータを転送する必要があります。 4. 機器故障 パソコンやプリンタなどの機器が故障し、作業が一時的に停止しました。 修理または予備の機器を使用する必要があります。 5. 品質問題 製品の品質に問題があり、顧客からクレームが寄せられました。 問題の解決策を見つけるために迅速に対応する必要があります。 6. 連絡ミス 重要な連絡事項を見落としてしまい、タスクの遅延や混乱が生じました。 確認プロセスを改善し、すべての連絡事項を確実に把握する必要があります。 7. プログラムエラー 使用しているソフトウェアやアプリケーションにバグがあり、予期しないエラーが発生しました。 開発者に報告し、修正を依頼して作業を続ける必要があります。 8. 人為ミス 作業中にミスをしてしまい、他のスタッフや顧客に迷惑をかけました。 再度確認を行い、同じミスを繰り返さないようにするための予防策が必要です。 9. 資材不足 必要な資材が不足しており、作業を続けることができません。 資材の追加発注や代替案の検討が必要です。 10. 締切遅れ タスクやプロジェクトの締切を守れず、スケジュールが遅れてしまいました。 原因を特定し、改善策を検討する必要があります。"},{"prompt":"長沙本週活動情報","completion":"以下是長沙本週的活動情報： 1. 美食節：長沙美食節將在本週舉行，屆時將有許多當地著名的美食攤位和餐廳參與活動，屆時居民和遊客都可以品嚐到各種美味佳餚。 2. 文化展覽：本週在長沙舉行的文化展覽將展示當地藝術家的作品，包括繪畫、雕塑和攝影等。屆時入場免費，大家可以欣賞到各種藝術創作。 3. 戶外音樂會：本週末將在長沙公園舉行一場戶外音樂會，現場將有多個樂團和表演者進行音樂表演。大家可以攜帶野餐墊和食物一同來享受音樂的美妙。 4. 打折活動：本週多家商店將舉行打折活動，包括服裝、家電和飾品等。居民和遊客可以在這些商店購物時獲得折扣優惠。 以上是長沙本週的活動情報，居民和遊客可以根據自己的喜好和興趣參加相應的活動。"},{"prompt":"写一篇基层政府调研报告","completion":"标题：基层政府调研报告 摘要： 本报告旨在调研分析我国基层政府的当前状况、面临的问题和改进的路径。通过实地考察、访谈和研究资料的收集整理，对基层政府的运行机制、服务质量和治理能力进行全面评估，提出改进建议和措施，以期提升基层政府的工作效率和居民满意度，推动社会稳定与发展。 一、引言 从基层政府的角度出发，调研报告首先介绍了基层政府的重要性和职责，并概括了调研的背景和目的。 二、基层政府的现状 通过对多个地区的基层政府进行实地考察和调研，发现目前基层政府存在以下问题： 1. 行政体制过于庞大、职能重叠； 2. 基层干部素质普遍较低，缺乏专业知识和管理能力； 3. 政府服务落后，满足不了居民的多样化需求； 4. 部分基层政府存在腐败和腐败问题。 三、面临的挑战 在全面分析了基层政府现状的基础上，调研报告指出基层政府面临的主要挑战： 1. 人员流动性大，导致政府连续性和稳定性不足； 2. 社区基础设施建设滞后，存在公共服务不均衡问题； 3. 政府治理体系还不够健全，决策效率较低。 四、改进的路径和建议 鉴于上述问题和挑战，调研报告提出了以下改进的路径和建议： 1. 优化行政体制，减少冗员，提高政府服务效率； 2. 培养基层干部的专业素质，提高管理能力； 3. 加强社会参与，建设开放透明的政府； 4. 加大反腐力度，建立有效监督机制。 五、结论 通过以上调研和分析，我们得出以下结论： 1. 基层政府是推动社会稳定与发展的重要力量； 2. 当前基层政府在服务质量和治理能力方面仍有待提高； 3. 改进积极有效的措施和政策可以提升基层政府的工作效率和居民满意度； 六、建议 最后，调研报告对进一步强化基层政府建设提出了以下建议： 1. 继续加大基层政府的改革力度，推动行政体制改革； 2. 加强培训和选拔工作，提高基层干部的素质； 3. 加强与居民的沟通与合作，提升政府服务质量； 4. 依法治理，形成有效的制衡和监督机制。 七、参考文献 列出了调研所涉及的相关文献和资料。 以上是本次基层政府调研报告的主要内容，希望对于进一步改进和提升我国基层政府的工作起到积极的促进作用，为实现社会稳定和可持续发展做出贡献。"},{"prompt":"鲁迅和周树人什么关系","completion":"鲁迅和周树人是中国近代文化领域的两位重要人物，他们之间有着复杂的关系。 首先，他们是同事关系。鲁迅和周树人都曾在中国北京的“文化风潮”杂志社工作。1918年至1920年间，鲁迅在该杂志担任编辑，并创作了许多重要的文章和小说。周树人也是该杂志的编辑之一，他们共同推动了这一时期的文化运动，并积极参与社会变革。 其次，他们有着互相尊重和合作的关系。鲁迅和周树人在文学和思想上有许多共同的观点，他们都关注社会现实和人民生活，并以文学来批判现实、探索人性。他们的作品都对中国社会的弊端进行了揭示和批评，对中国文学的发展产生了重要的影响。鲁迅曾评价周树人的作品：“他有我没有的东西，特别是对庸俗的了悟，我则多一些极端。”周树人则称赞鲁迅是“中国文艺史上的光辉事业”。 最后，他们在某些问题上存在分歧。鲁迅和周树人在文学批评和文艺观念上有一些不同的观点和方法。例如，鲁迅倾向于直接揭示社会黑暗、鞭挞懦弱，强调文学的社会责任和人文精神。而周树人则更注重文学的艺术性和个体感受，注重文学的审美价值和自由创作。因此，他们在文学理论和写作方式上存在差异。 总之，鲁迅和周树人是中国近代文化运动中两位杰出的思想家和作家，他们在文学创作、文化运动和思想交流方面对中国现代文化产生了深远的影响，他们的关系既有合作又存在分歧。"},{"prompt":"什么时候1+1不等于2","completion":"在普通的数学运算中，1+1等于2。但在一些特定情境下，特别是在一些哲学或逻辑的讨论中，1+1有时候可能不等于2。 例如，在集合论中，当两个集合有交集时，其元素的个数相加可能会超过两个集合所有元素的总数，这种情况下1+1可能不等于2。这是因为在集合论中，计数的概念和我们直观的数学运算有所不同。 另外，一些哲学和逻辑的讨论也可能引申出一些例子，使得1+1看似不等于2。这主要是通过扩展对数学概念的定义、从不同的角度思考问题，而不是传统意义上的数学运算。这种情况下，1+1的结果可能会取决于具体的定义和逻辑推理。 需要强调的是，在绝大多数情况下，1+1等于2是一种基础、普遍的数学规则，只有在特定的领域和特殊的定义下，才会出现1+1不等于2的情况。"},{"prompt":"接下来讨论的话题是回调函数，了解了回调函数的三个特征1、函数作为参数；2、延期执行；3、事件驱动。编写一个以java语言的事件驱动代码示例","completion":"以下是一个使用Java语言编写的简单事件驱动代码示例： \`\`\`java import java.util.ArrayList;

Identify one or more items that you believe were evidenced in the TED Talk by Leah Garcés. Explain your selection(s) and reason(s) (300 words)","completion":"In the \\"Power Play\\" reading by Pfeffer, he identifies eleven tactics for gaining power. These tactics revolve around manipulating situations and relationships to increase one's influence. When analyzing Leah Garcés' TED Talk, several of these tactics can be observed in her approach to animal rights activism. One tactic evident in her talk is \\"defying tradition.\\" Garcés challenges the traditional approach to animal rights advocacy by engaging with the poultry industry instead of solely targeting them as an enemy. She recognizes that collaboration and finding common ground with industry leaders can lead to significant changes. This defying of tradition allows her to have a seat at the table and influence decisions from within, challenging the conventional methods used by other activists. Another tactic illustrated by Garcés is \\"making other people dependent on you.\\" She emphasizes the need to engage and involve individuals who are passionate about animal rights. By providing these supporters with opportunities to contribute and make a difference, she makes them dependent on her organization, Mercy for Animals, for guidance and involvement in the cause. This tactic ensures a strong and committed network of activists and amplifies the impact of her organization. Furthermore, \\"appealing to values\\" is another tactic present in Leah Garcés' talk. She recognizes that simply bombarding people with facts and figures is not enough to bring about a shift in behavior or ideology. Instead, she appeals to people's innate values of compassion, empathy, and justice. This tactic of appealing to deeply held values resonates with a wider audience and encourages them to join the cause. In conclusion, Leah Garcés effectively employs several of the tactics outlined by Pfeffer in her TED Talk. She defies tradition, makes others dependent on her organization, and appeals to people's values to bring about change in the animal rights movement. By utilizing these tactics, she is able to challenge established norms, build a strong network of supporters, and generate a broader impact for her cause."},{"prompt":"已知圆上两点和半径，如何在matlab中得到圆心坐标","completion":"已知圆上两点和半径，可以通过以下步骤在MATLAB中得到圆心坐标： 1. 假设已知的圆上两点坐标分别为(x1, y1)和(x2, y2)，半径为r。 2. 计算两点之间的距离d，使用以下公式： d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) 3. 计算两点的中点坐标，使用以下公式： xm = (x1 + x2) / 2 ym = (y1 + y2) / 2 4. 计算圆心到中点的距离h，使用以下公式： h = sqrt(r^2 - (d/2)^2) 5. 计算两点连线的斜率k，使用以下公式： k = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) 6. 计算圆心坐标的两个可能值： xc1 = xm + h / sqrt(1 + k^2) yc1 = ym + k * (xc1 - xm) xc2 = xm - h / sqrt(1 + k^2) yc2 = ym + k * (xc2 - xm) 这样，就可以得到圆心坐标的两个可能值(xc1, yc1)和(xc2, yc2)。"},{"prompt":"matlab如何求圆上一段弧线长度？","completion":"要在MATLAB中求圆上一段弧线的长度，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 假设已知圆的半径为r，圆心坐标为(xc, yc)。 2. 假设所求弧线的起始角度为theta1，终止角度为theta2（以弧度表示）。 3. 使用以下公式计算角度差delta_theta： delta_theta = theta2 - theta1 4. 使用以下公式计算弧线长度s： s = r * delta_theta 这样，就可以得到圆上一段弧线的长度s。"},{"prompt":"帮我阅读如下matlab代码：x = L(1) + (d-b)*cos(theta); y = L(2) + (d-b)*sin(theta); distance = sqrt((A(1) - xi1_closest_AB)^2 + (A(2) -yi1_closest_AB )^2)+2*pi*(d-b)*abs(startAngle-endAngle)/360; % 画圆弧 plot(x, y, 'r'); axis equal; % 设置坐标轴比例相等，使圆弧显示为圆形 lineSegmentPoints = [A(1), xi1_closest_AB; A(2), yi1_closest_AB]; plot(lineSegmentPoints(1,:), lineSegmentPoints(2,:), 'k'); grid on hold on","completion":"这段MATLAB代码主要用于绘制圆弧。下面是对代码的逐行解读： 1. \`x = L(1) + (d-b)*cos(theta);\` 根据输入的参数计算圆弧上每个点的 x 坐标。 2. \`y = L(2) + (d-b)*sin(theta);\` 根据输入的参数计算圆弧上每个点的 y 坐标。 3. \`distance = sqrt((A(1) - xi1_closest_AB)^2 + (A(2) - yi1_closest_AB )^2)+2*pi*(d-b)*abs(startAngle-endAngle)/360;\` 计算圆弧的长度。根据圆心到起始点与终止点的直线距离以及圆弧的弧长，使用勾股定理计算两点之间的距离，并加上圆弧的弧长。 4. \`% 画圆弧\` 绘制圆弧。将 x 和 y 的坐标作为参数，设置为红色 ('r')。 5. \`axis equal;\` 设置坐标轴比例相等，使圆弧显示为圆形。 6. \`lineSegmentPoints = [A(1), xi1_closest_AB; A(2), yi1_closest_AB];\` 创建一个二维数组 \`lineSegmentPoints\`，其中包含起始点 \`A\` 和圆弧上最近的点 \`(xi1_closest_AB, yi1_closest_AB)\` 的坐标。 7. \`plot(lineSegmentPoints(1,:), lineSegmentPoints(2,:), 'k');\` 画直线段，将起始点 \`A\` 和圆弧上最近的点连接起来，使用黑色 ('k') 绘制。 8. \`grid on\` 显示坐标网格。 9. \`hold on\` 在绘图环境中保持当前图形，以便后续的图形可以叠加在该图形上。"},{"prompt":"已知两个点的坐标，如何用matlab汇出它们所形成的线段","completion":"要在MATLAB中绘制连接两个点的线段，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 假设已知两个点的坐标为(x1, y1)和(x2, y2)。 2. 创建一个二维数组 \`lineSegmentPoints\`，其中包含两点的坐标： \`lineSegmentPoints = [x1, x2; y1, y2];\` 3. 使用 \`plot\` 函数绘制直线段： \`plot(lineSegmentPoints(1,:), lineSegmentPoints(2,:));\` 完整的代码如下所示： \`\`\`matlab x1 = 1; % 第一个点的 x 坐标 y1 = 2; % 第一个点的 y 坐标 x2 = 3; % 第二个点的 x 坐标 y2 = 4; % 第二个点的 y 坐标 lineSegmentPoints = [x1, x2; y1, y2]; % 创建包含两点坐标的数组 plot(lineSegmentPoints(1,:), lineSegmentPoints(2,:)); % 绘制直线段 \`\`\` 运行该代码，就可以在图形界面中绘制出连接两个点的线段。"},{"prompt":"已知四个点A,B,C,D，如何用matlab画出线段AB和线段CD","completion":"要在MATLAB中绘制线段AB和线段CD，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 假设已知四个点的坐标分别为A(x1, y1)，B(x2, y2)，C(x3, y3)，D(x4, y4)。 2. 创建两个二维数组 \`lineSegmentAB\` 和 \`lineSegmentCD\`，分别包含线段AB和线段CD的坐标： \`\`\` lineSegmentAB = [x1, x2; y1, y2]; lineSegmentCD = [x3, x4; y3, y4]; \`\`\` 3. 使用 \`plot\` 函数分别绘制线段AB和线段CD： \`\`\` plot(lineSegmentAB(1,:), lineSegmentAB(2,:)); hold on; plot(lineSegmentCD(1,:), lineSegmentCD(2,:)); \`\`\` 完整的代码如下所示： \`\`\`matlab x1 = 1; % 点A的 x 坐标 y1 = 2; % 点A的 y 坐标 x2 = 3; % 点B的 x 坐标 y2 = 4; % 点B的 y 坐标 x3 = 5; % 点C的 x 坐标 y3 = 6; % 点C的 y 坐标 x4 = 7; % 点D的 x 坐标 y4 = 8; % 点D的 y 坐标 lineSegmentAB = [x1, x2; y1, y2]; % 创建线段AB的数组 lineSegmentCD = [x3, x4; y3, y4]; % 创建线段CD的数组 plot(lineSegmentAB(1,:), lineSegmentAB(2,:)); % 绘制线段AB hold on; plot(lineSegmentCD(1,:), lineSegmentCD(2,:)); % 绘制线段CD \`\`\` 运行该代码，就可以在图形界面中绘制出线段AB和线段CD。"},{"prompt":"matlab画出图像时如何增加标题","completion":"要在MATLAB绘制的图像中添加标题，可以使用 \`title\` 函数。按照以下步骤操作： 1. 使用 \`plot\` 函数或其他绘图函数创建图像。 2. 使用 \`title\` 函数添加标题。在 \`title\` 函数中传入一个字符串，该字符串将成为图像的标题。例如： \`\`\`matlab title('这是标题'); \`\`\` 以下是一个完整的例子： \`\`\`matlab x = 1:10; y = x.^2; plot(x, y); title('图像的标题'); \`\`\` 运行该代码，绘制出的图像将在图像顶部显示标题 \\"图像的标题\\"。"},{"prompt":"已知两个向量，如何用matlab求出它们的夹角","completion":"要使用MATLAB求出两个向量的夹角，可以使用 \`dot\` 函数和 \`acos\` 函数。按照以下步骤进行操作： 1. 假设已知两个向量为 \`v1\` 和 \`v2\`。 2. 使用 \`dot\` 函数计算两个向量的点积： \`dotProduct = dot(v1, v2);\` 3. 使用 \`norm\` 函数计算每个向量的模长： \`normV1 = norm(v1);\` \`normV2 = norm(v2);\` 4. 使用 \`acos\` 函数计算夹角的弧度： \`angleInRadians = acos(dotProduct / (normV1 * normV2));\` 5. 使用 \`rad2deg\` 函数将弧度转换为角度： \`angleInDegrees = rad2deg(angleInRadians);\` 完整的代码如下所示： \`\`\`matlab v1 = [1, 2, 3]; % 第一个向量 v2 = [4, 5, 6]; % 第二个向量 dotProduct = dot(v1, v2); % 计算点积 normV1 = norm(v1); % 计算第一个向量的模长 normV2 = norm(v2); % 计算第二个向量的模长 angleInRadians = acos(dotProduct / (normV1 * normV2)); % 计算夹角的弧度 angleInDegrees = rad2deg(angleInRadians); % 将弧度转换为角度 fprintf('夹角的弧度为: %.2fn', angleInRadians); fprintf('夹角的角度为: %.2fn', angleInDegrees); \`\`\` 运行该代码，即可计算出两个向量的夹角的弧度和角度，并将结果显示在命令窗口中。"},{"prompt":"напиши развернутую статью на тему Что любит перец в июле","completion":"Перец - это растение, которое принадлежит семейству пасленовых.

Accuracy in Monitoring: IEMs provide detailed and accurate sound reproduction, allowing the producer to hear subtle nuances and flaws in their music. This helps in making precise decisions during the mixing and mastering processes. 2. Portability and Flexibility: Producers often work in different environments and locations, including studios, on-the-go setups, and live venues. IEMs offer portability and flexibility, allowing the producer to monitor the music wherever they are, without the need for bulky studio monitors. 3. Noise Isolation: IEMs provide excellent noise isolation by sealing the ear canal, reducing external noise interference. This is particularly useful in noisy recording environments or when working in shared spaces, enabling the producer to focus on the details of their music without distractions. 4. Mixing and Balancing: IEMs can be used for critical listening, allowing the producer to make precise adjustments to the mix. They can accurately perceive the placement of different instruments, the stereo field, and the overall balance of the music. This helps in achieving a well-balanced and sonically pleasing mix. 5. Reference Listening: When working on different sound systems, such as car stereos, consumer headphones, or home speakers, IEMs can serve as a reliable reference tool. By checking the mix on IEMs, the producer can identify any issues or imbalances that might be missed on other playback devices. 6. Collaboration: IEMs can be used for collaborative sessions, where multiple producers or artists are involved. Each individual can wear their IEMs to monitor the mix according to their preference, allowing them to engage in real-time discussions and adjustments. 7. Protection from Loud Levels: In a studio setting or during live events, IEMs can serve as hearing protection, as they can reduce the overall volume reaching the producer's ears. This helps in preventing hearing damage caused by prolonged exposure to high sound levels. Overall, IEMs provide music producers with accurate monitoring, portability, noise isolation, and flexibility, enhancing their ability to create, mix, and evaluate their music effectively."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:j,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],L={key:0},B={key:1};function H(n,e,l,u,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",D,[(t(!0),i(w,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(t(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
