Write an article based on this summary: – Yesterday's Esquire opus on the SEAL Team 6 shooter who killed Osama bin Laden, left the Navy after 16 years, and now finds himself unemployed with no pension or health coverage, made waves. And it continues to today, thanks to the assertion by Stars and Stripes that the piece, written by Phil Bronstein, got one thing majorly wrong: \\"The Shooter,\\" as he is called, is actually \\"automatically eligible\\" for five years of health care on the VA's dime, as are all Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans, it reports. The editors of Esquire responded today, by tearing Stars and Stripes' assertion apart. Not only did they fault inaccuracies and trouble spots in the article (for instance, the headline, \\"Esquire article wrongly claims SEAL who killed bin Laden is denied healthcare,\\" is false, because Bronstein never reported the Shooter was denied it), but they explain that, like many veterans, the Shooter wasn't aware the benefits existed. But the heart of their rebuttal is this: \\"While the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits from the VA, his wife and two children are eligible for nothing. Not to get too deeply into the philosophy of insurance and the distribution of risk, but that means that under the best scenario, the Shooter is 1/4 covered, which of course means that he is not covered at all. It would be like having a 1/4 roof during a storm. Your house still fills with water.\\" Click for the Stars and Stripes article and Esquire's response.","completion":"Title: The Controversy Surrounding the Healthcare Coverage of the SEAL Team 6 Shooter Introduction In the aftermath of the Esquire opus article featuring the SEAL Team 6 shooter responsible for killing Osama bin Laden, a controversy has arisen regarding the benefits and healthcare coverage of the unnamed individual. The article painted a picture of the Navy SEAL leaving the force after 16 years without a pension or adequate healthcare coverage, leaving him and his family exposed to potential risks. Following the publication, Stars and Stripes reported that the Esquire article contained incorrect information, claiming that \\"The Shooter\\" is automatically qualified for five years of health care benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Esquire's editors have since responded, defending the accuracy of the article and criticizing Stars and Stripes' assertions. The Dispute Between Esquire and Stars and Stripes Esquire's editors pointed out several inaccuracies and trouble spots in Stars and Stripes' article, one of which was the headline, \\"Esquire article wrongly claims SEAL who killed bin Laden is denied healthcare.\\" Esquire's article, written by Phil Bronstein, did not actually report that the Shooter was denied healthcare benefits. Instead, the article suggested that the SEAL Team 6 member, like many veterans, was not aware of his eligibility for VA benefits. Family Coverage Concerns Esquire's editors primarily focused their defense on the limitations of the Shooter's benefits, emphasizing that while the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits, his wife and children are not provided for. They explained that this leaves the family's health care situation largely unresolved, stating, \\"While the Shooter may be eligible for some direct benefits from the VA, his wife and two children are eligible for nothing… under the best scenario, the Shooter is 1/4 covered, which of course means that he is not covered at all.\\" Furthermore, the editors drew an analogy regarding this situation to having a \\"1/4 roof during a storm,\\" in which \\"your house still fills with water,\\" emphasizing the inadequacy of the healthcare coverage provided to the Shooter and his family. Conclusion The controversy surrounding the healthcare coverage of the SEAL Team 6 shooter responsible for killing Osama bin Laden has prompted a debate over the benefits and support provided to military veterans and their families. While Stars and Stripes has taken issue with Esquire's report, the magazine's editors defend their work and maintain that the shooter's incomplete and insufficient coverage represents a larger issue facing many veterans. As this debate continues, the focus remains on the necessity of comprehensive support and proper information dissemination for military personnel and their families."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria, since Pick from: * Jessica had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts.; * Maria had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts.;","completion":"Studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria, since Jessica had always thought long and hard about abstract concepts. From a young age, she had been fascinated by the nature of existence, the origins of morality, and the intricacies of the human mind. This inherent curiosity led her to explore various philosophical theories and ideas, such as those presented by Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant. Over the years, Jessica honed her critical thinking skills and the ability to analyze and evaluate different viewpoints. This background in philosophy enabled her to delve deeper into complex subjects and engage in conversations with unique perspectives. Additionally, her love for reading and research made it easier for her to navigate through the abstract and dense philosophical texts that are required to understand these concepts fully. On the other hand, Maria found studying philosophy more challenging, as she had always been more inclined toward practical subjects and tasks. Having a background in science and mathematics, Maria preferred dealing with concrete and quantifiable problems. She often struggled to understand the essence of philosophical discussions, finding it difficult to see the relevance and application of these concepts in everyday life. Despite these differences, Maria acknowledged the importance of philosophy and was determined to learn from Jessica's expertise. As they studied together, Jessica patiently explained the nuances of various philosophical theories, while Maria shared her perspectives on how these ideas could be linked to the real world and practical situations. Over time, Maria began to appreciate the value of philosophy in nurturing a broader understanding of the world and its complexities. Through this collaborative learning process, both Jessica and Maria expanded their worldviews and developed a deeper respect for each other's unique strengths and passions. In conclusion, studying philosophy was easier for Jessica than Maria because Jessica had always been captivated by abstract concepts, and her experience allowed her to navigate through the challenges of philosophical discourse effortlessly. However, the combined efforts of both Jessica and Maria led them to gain valuable insights from their different perspectives, ultimately enriching their overall understanding and appreciation of philosophy as a discipline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography.

Review: Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan. They had been moderately successful together in the 1970's, with the likes of 'The Land that Time Forgot' (1975), 'At the Earth's Core' (1976) etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though, the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way. The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century, with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide. A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place. No surprises as to what happens next, with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) assuming the role of the wife's lover. Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion. Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( 'The Omen' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ), and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George. The first is a long 'Don't Look Now' inspired piece with her hubby, complete with piano music; the second a much shorter (probably at her insistence) entanglement with McClure, both looking pretty uncomfortable. Anyway, every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost. Overall I can't decide whether 'The House where Evil Dwells' is rubbish, watchable rubbish, or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way. If you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all, but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort. BEST SCENE - in any other film the big, black, tree-climbing, Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup. On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is (!!!!), to be told beef and vegetable, before uttering the immortal line \\"Ugh - there's an awful face in my soup\\". If this wasn't enough the reply is \\"C'mon, eat your soup for Daddy.\\" Laurel & Hardy rest in piece. Now, what is this review like? OPT: (1). negative. (2). positive.","completion":"This review is predominantly negative in tone, with the author expressing their dissatisfaction about various aspects of the film. The film, \\"The House where Evil Dwells,\\" is described as \\"shabby and derivative\\" with a clumsy and ungraceful narrative progression. The author is particularly critical of the film's inability to engage the audience without the use of plastic monsters, which were successful in some of the earlier films by the director and lead actor. The predictability of the plot and the lack of surprises are frowned upon, and the overall execution of the film is seen as clumsy and lacking elegance. Despite the negative comments and critiques, the reviewer does acknowledge moments of interest in the film, like the two decapitations and Susan George's love-making scenes, which offer some visual appeal for horror fans. However, these positives seem to be overshadowed by the general dissatisfaction with the film's execution. The reviewer concludes by stating that the film may only have appeal for specific horror genre fans, but even then, it's unclear if the movie is entirely worth watching for them. While there are moments of potential entertainment and some campy appeal, the overall assessment of \\"The House where Evil Dwells\\" remains largely negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Spain and Italy participated in a global warming global forum this year. it turns out that Spain uses lots of fossil fuel and natural gas for their economy, while Italy relies on ecological alternatives. Which country didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Answer:","completion":"The country between Spain and Italy that didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats due to global warming is Italy. According to the provided context, Italy relies on ecological alternatives for energy production, as opposed to Spain, which relies heavily on the use of fossil fuels and natural gas. Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are currently the world's primary energy source. They are formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals, like dinosaurs, over the course of millions of years. When burned, fossil fuels release a high amount of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, which substantially contributes to global warming. Natural gas, while cleaner than oil and coal, is still associated with the production of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, all of which contribute to global warming and climate change when released into the atmosphere. On the other hand, ecological alternatives employed by Italy constitute renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. These sources produce electricity without directly emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Thus, their usage decreases the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigating global warming's impact and preserving natural habitats. It's worth noting that no country is entirely guilt-free when it comes to contributing to climate change, as various aspects of human activities release carbon and other greenhouse gases. In this particular comparison, however, Italy holds a lesser detrimental effect on the environment and the extinction of natural habitats due to its reliance on ecological alternatives for energy. This example illustrates the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change, including the extinction of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. It also underscores the vital role every country can play as part of the collective action required to address global warming and protect our planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The band drew on the music of jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound, and with Brian as composer, arranger, producer, and de facto leader, often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Context: Recorded in the wake of California Music's demise, a supergroup that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer Terry Melcher, 15 Big Ones (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Blueberry Hill\\", and \\"In the Still of the Night\\". \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's \\"It's O.K.\\" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 NBC-TV special, simply titled The Beach Boys. The special, produced by Saturday Night Live (SNL) creator Lorne Michaels, featured appearances by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, \\"[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep\\", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's \\"Good Vibrations\\". For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album The Beach Boys Love You (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian later called Love You one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, saying that \\"That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.\\" Jardine credited Carl and Dennis with having \\"the most to do with that album ... [they were] paying tribute to their brother.\\" Love You peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a cult following; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of synthpop. Referring to \\"naysayers\\" of the album, the underground fanzine Scram wrote, \\"Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliche, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.\\" The A.V. Club - considering the album in \\"the same vein\\" as Tonight's the Night (1975), Pussy Cats (1974), The Madcap Laughs (1970), and Barrett (1970) - described Love You as: \\"something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and Johnny Carson - like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It's a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art - one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson's overall worldview.\\" In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in Marina del Rey while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Ronald Reagan's Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that \\"rock bands\\" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted \\"the wrong element\\", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior, the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, \\"...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element.\\" Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys, \\"They're my friends and I like their music\\". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had \\"shot himself in the foot\\". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people. On July 4, 1985, the group played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the Live Aid concert. In 1985, they released the eponymous album The Beach Boys and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as David Lee Roth's hit version of \\"California Girls\\". \\"Getcha Back\\", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\" (U.S., No. 57). In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, performing the song \\"Wipe Out\\" and filming a music video. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK. By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, Brian Wilson. During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. No. 1 hit single in 22 years with \\"Kokomo\\", which had appeared in the movie Cocktail, and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. They released the album Still Cruisin, which went gold in the U.S. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy Problem Child. The album Summer in Paradise, had no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker Eugene Landy. A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, Sea of Tunes, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded 25 million for unpaid royalties. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Brian in 1992, winning 13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love. In 1993, the band appeared in Michael Feeney Callan's film The Beach Boys Today, which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian Jeff Foxworthy on the recording Howdy From Maui, and eventually released Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as Toby Keith and Willie Nelson. Brian acted as co-producer. Question: did any other songs or albums peak?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, apart from the mentioned songs and albums, several other songs and albums by The Beach Boys have experienced notable peaks on music charts during their career. Here are some highlights: 1. \\"Surfin' Safari\\" (1962) - the album peaked at No. 32 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 2. \\"Surfin' USA\\" (1963) - the single peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the album reached No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 3. \\"Surfer Girl\\" (1963) - the single peaked at No. 7 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and the album reached No. 7 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 4. \\"I Get Around\\" (1964) - the single became their first No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. 5. \\"All Summer Long\\" (1964) - the album peaked at No. 4 on the US Billboard 200 chart. 6. \\"California Girls\\" (1965) - the single peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart 7. \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) - the album reached No. 10 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. 8. \\"Good Vibrations\\" (1966) - the single peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. 9. \\"Wild Honey\\" (1967) - the album reached No. 24 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. 10. \\"Sunflower\\" (1970) - the album peaked at No. 151 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 29 on the UK Albums Chart. 11. \\"Endless Summer\\" (1974) - this compilation album peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart. These peaks represent just a portion of the notable achievements by The Beach Boys in terms of songs and albums chart performance throughout their career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year. Which month of the year was wetter, September 2018 or September 2019? Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] A:","completion":"Given the information provided, we can infer that in 2018, the subtropical ridge was stronger than normal, leading to a wet year for the Four Corners area which consists of Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. This is in contrast to 2019, where the subtropical ridge was weaker, resulting in a dry year. Based on these facts, one can deduce that September 2018 was a wetter month compared to September 2019 in the Four Corners area. This is due to the stronger subtropical ridge in 2018 that influenced the northward extension of monsoon moisture and thunderstorms into the United States, particularly the Desert Southwest region, which includes the Four Corners area. In 2018, the stronger subtropical ridge allowed monsoon conditions to persist from July to September, leading to an increased amount of rainfall in the Four Corners area. However, in 2019, the weaker subtropical ridge led to a drier atmosphere in the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime, and thus resulting in lesser precipitation during September 2019 relative to September 2018. In conclusion, September 2018 was a wetter month than September 2019 for the Four Corners area due to the differing strength of the subtropical ridge in those years, which directly influenced the presence and intensity of monsoon season in the region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses.

The decisive truth-telling fact was a tooth in a wooden box marked with the queen's name, Hawass said. The box was found in 1881 in a hiding place of royal mummies collected and hidden away at the Deir al-Bahari temple about 1,000 metres away from the tomb. Checking all the mummies which might be Hatshepsut's, Yehya Zakariya, a medicine professor, found that the tooth was a perfect fit in a hole in the upper jaw of one of the two females, a fat woman believed to have suffered from cancer and diabetes. \\"The recognition of the tooth with the jaw can show this is Hatshepsut,\\" Hawass said. \\"A tooth is like a fingerprint.\\" Another researcher Elizabeth Thomas _ many years ago that one of the mummies was Hatshepsut's because how the right arm was put over the woman's chest suggested royalty .

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the man who was considered a \\"dangerous modernist\\" elected president of in March 1863? In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

Here's more bad news for people with a sweet tooth. Not only can excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity, it can also make you look old too. A diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness. Nutritionist Brooke Alpert and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris explain why in their new book, The Sugar Detox. They write: 'So, do people who eat too much sugar really look older? The answer is a resounding YES! In a large study published in the journal AGE, 602 people were examined by independent evaluators. Moment on the lips, lifetime on the face: Too much sugar can prematurely age your skin. 'Healthy people with lower blood sugars. typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars,. and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age.' They explain: 'Too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin: Simply put, it makes skin unhealthy. Skin is our largest organ; one of its main functions, called barrier function, is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution, dirt, bacteria, and fungi. 'Anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections. Some very interesting recent studies have shown that long-term hyperglycemia (too much sugar in the blood) leaves skin more vulnerable. 'This explains why diabetics and others with long-standing hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin. This is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin.' Pamper and protect: Nutritionist Brooke Alpert, left, and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris have developed a diet plan and skincare regime to help people look younger. The pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age, making it wrinkly and saggy, and poor nutrition can accelerate this process. But they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan. As previously reported in the MailOnline, the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar. On the low carb plan, dairy, fruit (with the exception of lemon and lime), starches, wheat and any added sugars are all banned. Some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses. The pair say going 'cold turkey' for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar. The foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body - and especially for the skin. For example, they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production. Turn back the clock: Swap coffee with added sugar for green tea. Process in a blender:. Apply a thin layer of the mixture to your face, leave on for ten minutes then wash off with warm water.Why. it works: The yogurt contains exfoliating lactic acid, oatmeal is a. natural anti-inflammatory, honey has healing properties and acts as a. natural moisturizer, and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants. At meal times they recommend. regularly consuming fish high in Omega 3 such as salmon. This is because. they contain essential fatty acids that are 'the building blocks for. the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated.' When. it comes to drinks, their superhero product for the skin is green tea -. which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers. They also. recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under. eye bags and puffiness. They. explain why it's so good for helping the skin look more youthful:. 'Studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively. blocks collagen cross-linking and inhibits AGE accumulation associated. with ageing. 'Green tea can also be prepared as an extract for use in cosmeceutical skin care. Topical green tea extract protects against UV-induced inflammation and oxidative stress, making it a powerful, topical skin care agent. Using skin-care products containing GTPs is an excellent way to inhibit collagen glycation and protect skin from damaging UV rays.' Read all about it: The Sugar Detox is available to buy as an ebook. As they are aware many will find the three day detox difficult, the book also includes DIY beauty treatments you can do at home over the three days to boost your mood and rejuvenate your skin. Their spa treatments include a sea mud mask, an 'ancient beauty bath', i.e. one where you soak in bathing salts, and a 'moisturising antioxidant mask'. This can either be bought in the shops (they provide a list of recommended products) or made yourself using their recipe (see pink box above, right). The aim of the treatments is to make people feel better with some pampering as they detox but also give their skin a head start on recovery before the benefits of the new diet kick in. Beyond the three day pampering, the pair outline a skincare regime that people should follow in tandem with their diet plan to look and feel good on the inside and out. They guarantee people who follow their advice will notice a difference in the appearance of their skin which will look younger and healthier. What could be sweeter than that?

Photosynthesis is a vital process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy using carbon dioxide and water as primary raw materials, and eventually producing glucose and oxygen as byproducts. To answer the question, \\"What is a source of oxygen through photosynthesis?\\" we must identify which of the available options involves a living organism capable of performing photosynthesis: [a]. Lakes - Although lakes do not directly produce oxygen through photosynthesis, they can sometimes be indirectly involved in the process. For instance, lakes may contain aquatic plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria that contribute to oxygen production. However, a lake by itself is not capable of going through the photosynthesis process, as it is not a living organism. [b]. Car engines - Car engines are not biological entities and do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis. Instead, they create exhaust fumes, which include carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that has a detrimental impact on the environment. In fact, car engines contribute to the increase in carbon dioxide levels, which photosynthetic organisms use as raw material to produce oxygen and glucose. [c]. Sunflowers - Sunflowers belong to the plant kingdom and are fully capable of conducting photosynthesis. As living organisms with chlorophyll containing structures called chloroplasts, sunflowers absorb light energy from the sun, and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and water from the soil, to produce glucose and oxygen. Therefore, sunflowers serve as a source of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. [d]. People - Human beings are not capable of performing photosynthesis. We belong to the animal kingdom and rely on plants for our oxygen supply. Animals, including humans, breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide through the process of respiration. We depend on the oxygen generated by photosynthetic organisms, which in turn use the carbon dioxide we produce to perform photosynthesis. Based on these descriptions, the correct answer to the question, \\"What is a source of oxygen through photosynthesis?\\" is option [c].

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art?

First, all U.S. states except Louisiana have enacted \\"reception statutes\\" which generally state that the common law of England (particularly judge-made law) is the law of the state to the extent that it is not repugnant to domestic law or indigenous conditions. Some reception statutes impose a specific cutoff date for reception, such as the date of a colony's founding, while others are deliberately vague. Thus, contemporary U.S. courts often cite pre-Revolution cases when discussing the evolution of an ancient judge-made common law principle into its modern form, such as the heightened duty of care traditionally imposed upon common carriers. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Reception statues are generally the same as what law?","completion":"Reception statutes are generally the same as the common law of England, specifically judge-made law. A reception statute is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes a U.S. state, which receives or adopts the English common law in existence at the time of independence, making it the new state's common law. Reception statutes have been widely adopted across states; they facilitate the continuation of English common law as the basis of the legal system in the U.S. This allows for the adoption of centuries of case law precedents, legal principles, and doctrines that had evolved over time in England. However, these reception statutes make clear that the adoption of English common law is not absolute. It's subject to modification or even rejection if it's found to be repugnant to the domestic law of the particular state or to its indigenous conditions. This has resulted in variations in how English common law is applied across different states in America. The specifics of reception statutes can differ from state to state. Some states' statutes specify a cutoff date, which is usually the date of a colony's founding, post which the English laws are not received. Other states keep it deliberately vague, not setting a fixed cutoff date. Thus, reception statutes are in essence the backbone of the American legal tradition, but they continue to evolve in response to the unique needs and circumstances of individual states and the nation as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who formed the band named Jaojoby? After several years having focused entirely on his career with the Regional Information Service, Jaojoby was approached in 1987 by Frenchman Pierre Henri Donat to contribute several recordings to Madagascar's first salegy compilation album, Les Grands Maîtres du Salegy (\\"Grand Masters of Salegy\\"). The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\". High demand for live performances led the singer to return to Antananarivo in 1988 to form a band named \\"Jaojoby\\" that included former bandmates from Los Matadores and The Players. Jaojoby begin touring regularly at home and abroad, performing his first international concerts in Paris in 1989. In the meantime, he worked as a press attaché for the Ministry of Transport, Meteorology and Tourism from 1990 until 1993, at which point he left his job to become a full-time musician.The 1992 release of Jaojoby's first full-length album, titled Salegy!, was facilitated by fRoots magazine editor Ian Anderson, who had worked with Jaojoby to record several of his tracks for a radio broadcast two years previously.

Their first two albums were released by the Sub Pop and Bella Union record labels, with their third by Nonesuch and Bella Union. The band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP, Sun Giant, and their self-titled debut album. Both received much critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band 60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009-10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010. In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound \\"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\\". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, \\"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record.\\" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with \\"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\\" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments. The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, \\"Battery Kinzie\\", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track \\"Grown Ocean\\", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12\\" vinyl double A-side single of \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and \\"Grown Ocean\\" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\". On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band. He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage.

Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose death at the height of her fame and was a shock to the musical world? Answer the above question based on the context below: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United...

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose only remaining son died in 840? Answer the above question based on the context below: Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, an American country rock band, has existed in various forms since its founding in Long Beach, California in 1966. The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001 departing once again in November 2017. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded around 1966 in Long Beach, California by singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and singer-songwriter guitarist Bruce Kunkel who had performed as the New Coast Two and later the Illegitimate Jug Band. Trying, in the words of the band's website, to \\"figure out how not to have to work for a living,\\" Hanna and Kunkel joined informal jam sessions at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Long Beach. There they met a few other musicians: guitarist/washtub bassist Ralph Barr, guitarist-clarinetist Les Thompson, harmonicist and jug player Jimmie Fadden, and guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne. As Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the six men started as a jug band and adopted the burgeoning southern California folk rock musical style, playing in local clubs while wearing pinstripe suits and cowboy boots. Their first paying performance was at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California. Browne was in the band for only a few months before he left to concentrate on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. He was replaced by John McEuen on banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and steel guitar. McEuen's older brother, William, was the group's manager, and he helped the band get signed with Liberty Records, which released the group's debut album, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band during 1967. The band's first single, \\"Buy for Me the Rain,\\" was a Top 40 success, and the band gained exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as concerts with such disparate artists as Jack Benny and The Doors. A second album, Ricochet, was released later during the year and was less successful than their first. Kunkel wanted the band to \\"go electric\\", and include more original material. Bruce left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow. By 1968, the band adopted electrical instruments anyway, and added drums. The first electric album, Rare Junk, was a commercial failure, as was their next, Alive. The band continued to gain publicity, mainly as a novelty act, making an appearance in the 1968 film, For Singles Only, and a cameo appearance in the 1969 musical western film, Paint Your Wagon, performing \\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\\". The band also played Carnegie Hall as an opening act for Bill Cosby and played in a jam session with Dizzy Gillespie.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: DId they experience any other significant changes in the band during this period?","completion":"Yes, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band experienced several significant changes during this period. One such change occurred when founding member Bruce Kunkel left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. Kunkel was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow. Another change was the band's transition from a purely acoustic sound to an electric one, as they added drums and other electric instruments to their lineup. This shift in style can be seen in their albums \\"Rare Junk\\" and \\"Alive,\\" both of which were commercial failures at the time. Furthermore, the band gained publicity as a novelty act, appearing in movies such as \\"For Singles Only\\" and \\"Paint Your Wagon\\" during this period."},{"prompt":"What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Not able to get started\\" A:","completion":"★"},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

What is the sentiment of the following document towards the entity David Mitchell ? Zhang: As you know Novartis disputes the 200 million figure because not all of that money went directly to CAR-T for cancer or toward the specific therapy behind Kymriah. Mitchell : We're going to send you a clip from a blog post by Francis Collins the head of the National Institutes of Health in which he explains the long history of NIH in building the foundational science for CAR-T. Here's our position: From 1993 until 2017 NIH invested more than 200 million in the overall science of CAR-T. Even the seminal paper that was published in August of 2011 by Dr. Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania was funded in part by the NIH. All of the makers—Novartis Kite (which will become Gilead) and Juno [other companies pursuing CAR-T cell therapy]—are standing on that foundational science. The taxpayers invested early when the risk was the greatest. Zhang: What do you think is a fair price for Kymriah? Mitchell: Well we have run the numbers a variety of different ways. Now the point is no one knows the real numbers except Novartis so we go back to the statements in a Reuters article in 2015 where Kite’s chief financial officer said they thought the base price was 150 000 for treatment and analysts at that time were saying [costs could be] up to 300 000. When we tried to model we can’t get over 300 000. Zhang: Novartis did take two unusual steps when announcing the price of Kymriah. First they pointed to a British analysis to say they actually thought Kymriah was worth 600 000 to 750 000 but they were going to price it lower at 475 000. And second they said patients who don’t respond after 30 days to the treatment will not have to pay. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the given sentence and entity. Usage: The given sentence is a conversation between Zhang and Mitchell discussing the cost of Kymriah, a cancer treatment. The entity in question is David Mitchell.

Help as much as you can. Information: - The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. In some ways, calling it a \\"joint\\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints). - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cecum or caecum (plural ceca ; from the Latin \\"caecus\\" meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). - In human anatomy, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs. - An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial. - The pelvic inlet or superior aperture of the pelvis is a planar surface which defines the boundary between the pelvic cavity and the abdominal cavity (or, according to some authors, between two parts of the pelvic cavity, called lesser pelvis and greater pelvis). - The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon. - The thorax or chest (from the Greek \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. - In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. - The rectum (from the Latin \\" \\", meaning \\"straight intestine\\") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge. - The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon . It crosses the abdomen from the ascending colon at the hepatic or right colic flexure with a downward convexity to the descending colon where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen forming the splenic or left colic flexure . In its course , it describes an arch , the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward . Toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve . It is almost completely invested by peritoneum , and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane , the transverse mesocolon . It is in relation , by its upper surface , with the liver and gall - bladder , the greater curvature of the stomach , and the lower end of the spleen ; by its under surface , with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface , with the posterior layer of the greater omentum and the abdominal wall ; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum , the head of the pancreas , and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum . The transverse colon absorbs water and salts . - The pubic symphysis or symphysis pubis is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2 mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth. - The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 35-40 cm in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma () or Latin letter S (thus \\"sigma\\" + \\"-oid\\"). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity. - The pelvic brim is the edge of the pelvic inlet. It is an approximately apple-shaped line passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the arcuate and pectineal lines, and the upper margin of the pubic symphysis. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. - The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet , opening into the pelvis. - The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum. - The spleen (from Greek \\"spln\\") is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - The cephalothorax, also called prosoma in some groups, is a tagma of various arthropods, comprising the head and the thorax fused together, as distinct from the abdomen behind. (The terms \\"prosoma\\" and \\"opisthosoma\\" are equivalent to \\"cephalothorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\" in some groups.) The word \\"cephalothorax\\" is derived from the Greek words for head and thorax . This fusion of the head and thorax is seen in chelicerates and crustaceans; in other groups, such as the Hexapoda (including insects), the head remains free of the thorax. In horseshoe crabs and many crustaceans, a hard shell called the carapace covers the cephalothorax. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. - The large intestine, or the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation. What entity does 'transverse colon' has the relation 'subclass of' with?

He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health. Faced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion. First he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope. Secondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room. The third thing Cousins did was get a movie projector and a large supply of funny films. On his first night in the hotel Cousins found that he laughed so hard at the films that he was able to stimulate chemicals in his body that allowed him several hours of pain-free sleep. When the pain returned he would simply turn the projector back on and the laughter would help sleep, and he was able to measure the changes in his body by measuring his blood sedimentation rate , and found that this rate dropped by at least 5 points each time he watched one of these videos. The treatment proved to be so effective that in very little time Cousins was off all painkillers and sleeping pills. He found that the laughter relieved the pain and helped him sleep. He returned to work and wrote about his... Question: Which of the following can be the title for the passage?

The National Transportation Safety Board also found that the three-member crew flying the Boeing 777 was fatigued at the end of a cross-Pacific trip from South Korea and distracted by cockpit duties as the plane made its final approach July 6 - both of which probably contributed to their failure to notice that the jet was descending too quickly and losing speed. Based on its findings, the safety board recommended that Boeing create better training manuals and procedures for using its automatic throttle controls. It also urged Asiana to improve its training methods and give more manual flight instruction to its pilots so they will be better able to handle any confusion about automation. Crew 'mismanagement' A majority of the board, however, pinned the crash squarely on pilot \\"mismanagement,\\" describing as many as 30 errors that cascaded from minor and correctable 14 miles out of San Francisco to catastrophic and irreversible moments before the crash. The three pilots on board \\"had multiple opportunities to recover if it wasn't going well\\" but failed to do so, said agency investigator Roger Cox. The plane's instrument panel puts \\"plenty of cues in front of you telling what you have done, but you have to look at them,\\" he said. Investigators said the pilots \\"lacked critical manual flying skills.\\" SFO's worst accident Three passengers died and nearly 200 were injured when Asiana Flight 214 hit a seawall short of the runway, broke apart and caught fire, in the worst accident ever at SFO. One passenger, a 16-year-old girl from China, was run over by two San Francisco fire rigs in the confusion of the emergency response. Much of the safety board's attention focused on whether the South Korean crew members adequately understood systems that they believed would automatically prevent the plane from losing too much speed. Christopher Hart, the board's acting chairman, said the crew \\"over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand.\\" The board's investigation team said the crew's key error was a lack of knowledge about how to use the auto-throttle, which is meant to maintain a safe speed. The flying pilot, who had eight years of experience with Asiana but was a novice on the Boeing 777, had disengaged the autopilot when the plane climbed too high, putting the auto-throttle into a hold mode. He expected the auto-throttle to \\"wake up\\" if the plane's airspeed slowed too much, investigators found. However, because he had also turned off the autopilot, the auto-throttle was stuck in idle - a functional interaction of the controls that he did not know about. As a result, the plane's speed fell to 118 mph when it hit the seawall, well below the target speed of 157 mph for a landing. The pilot, Lee Kang-guk, 45, told investigators he was \\"astonished\\" upon learning that the auto-throttle didn't work as he expected. Investigators said the throttle mode was displayed on the instrument panel and that the pilots all failed to \\"call out\\" their actions to alert each other as to what each was doing. Defending crew While some safety board members sharply criticized the pilots, board member Robert Sumwalt, a former pilot, forcefully defended the crew. He said Asiana's training for using the automated throttle system was insufficient - and that there was misunderstanding even among some U.S. trainers about the system on the Boeing 777. \\"The errors of the pilots were not because of any incompetence,\\" Sumwalt said. \\"They were because of an expectation that the autopilot auto-throttle system would do something the airplane was not designed to do.\\" Boeing took issue Tuesday with the board's recommendation that it make the interface between the plane's automated systems and pilots more intuitive. In a statement, the company said it \\"respectfully disagrees\\" with the finding that the 777's auto-flight system contributed to the accident, saying the evidence showed that \\"all of the airplane's systems performed as designed.\\" Tired pilots? Asiana Airlines issued a statement saying the safety board \\"properly recognized the multiple factors that contributed to this accident.\\" One of the factors, the safety board found, was fatigue on the part of pilots landing the plane at what would have been nighttime in Seoul after a 10 1/2-hour flight. But investigators did not explain how the Asiana pilots' fatigue differed from that of any other international flight crew, and some experts dismissed the finding. \\"That's an absurdity,\\" said aviation consultant Barry Schiff of Los Angeles. \\"Every pilot is off his time zone when he goes across the ocean. We've had to put up that since the beginning of flight. \\"The bottom line is the pilots failed to monitor and maintain proper flying speed, which is about as fundamental as it gets,\\" Schiff said. \\"Whether the auto-throttle system functioned as it should have is irrelevant.\\" This story has been corrected since it appeared in print editions. ||||| FILE - In this July 6, 2013 aerial file photo, the wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 lies on the ground after it crashed at the San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco. Nearly a year after Asiana... (Associated Press) The National Transportation Safety Board said there was confusion over whether one of the airliner's key controls was maintaining speed. The agency also cited the complexity of the Boeing 777's autothrottle and pilot training by the South Korea-based airline as contributing to the crash, which killed three passengers and injured more than 200. The plane, with 307 people on board, was too low and too slow during the landing attempt. Its tail struck a seawall and was ripped off. The rest of plane went spinning and sliding down the runway. The crash was the only fatal passenger airline accident in the U.S. in the last five years. Before the vote, Chris Hart, the NTSB's acting chairman, said that increasingly complex automated aircraft controls designed to improve safety are instead creating new opportunities for error. The Asiana flight crew \\"over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand,\\" he said. Among the other issues raised by the investigation are some that long have concerned aviation officials, including hesitancy by some pilots to abort a landing when things go awry or to challenge a captain's actions. The irony of the accident is that it occurred at all. Three experienced pilots were in the cockpit on July 6, 2013. The plane, a Boeing 777, had one of the industry's best safety records. And weather conditions that sunny day were near perfect. But the wide-bodied jetliner with 307 people on board was too low and too slow during the landing. It struck a seawall just short of the runway, ripping off the tail and sending the rest of the plane spinning and skidding down the runway. When the shattered plane came to rest, a fire erupted. Despite the violence of the crash, only three people were killed - Chinese teens seated in the back who may not have been wearing their seatbelts and were thrown from the plane. One of the teenage girls survived the crash but was run over by two rescue vehicles in the chaos afterward. Nearly 200 people were injured. In documents made public by the safety board, Asiana acknowledged the likely cause of the accident was the crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble. The South Korea-based airline said the pilot and co-pilot reasonably believed the automatic throttle would keep the plane flying fast enough to land safely, when in fact the auto throttle was effectively shut off after the pilot idled it to correct an unexplained climb earlier in the landing. Asiana said the plane should have been designed so that the auto throttle would maintain the proper speed after the pilot put it in \\"hold mode.\\" Boeing had been warned about the problem by U.S. and European aviation regulators. Asiana urged the safety board to recommend that the aircraft maker be required to include an audible warning to alert pilots when the throttle changes to a setting in which it no longer is maintaining speed. \\"Asiana has a point,\\" said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant, \\"but this is not the first time it has happened. Any of these highly automated airplanes have these conditions that require special training and pilot awareness. ... This is something that has been known for many years and trained for many years.\\" Boeing told the board there was nothing wrong with the plane, and the crash was caused by the failure of the pilots to maintain speed and to abort the landing when the approach had become unstable, as required by their company's policies. An unstable approach occurs when a plane's speed or rate of descent is too fast or to slow, or the plane isn't properly aligned for landing. Captain Lee Kang Kuk, 45, a veteran pilot who was new to the 777, was flying the plane. Because an airport navigational aid that helps planes land wasn't working that day, Kuk was flying a visual approach that involves lining up the jet for landing by looking through the windshield and using numerous other cues, rather than relying on a radio-based system called a glide-slope that guides aircraft to the runway. A training captain was sitting next to him in the right seat watching his performance. Kuk told transportation accident investigators that he did not immediately move to abort the landing after it became unstable because he felt only the instructor pilot had that authority. Cockpit culture in which the senior captain is viewed as supreme was identified as a factor in several South Korean airliner crashes in the 1980s and '90s. Afterward, procedures and hierarchies were overhauled in Korea and elsewhere, including the U.S. ___ Mendoza reported from Santa Cruz, California. ___ Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy and Martha Mendoza at http://www.twitter.com/mendozamartha ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In 2013, a plane crashed because the pilots made some mistakes.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Saint Francis River is a tributary of the Mississippi River , about 426 miles ( 686 km ) long , in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the United States . The river drains a mostly rural area and forms part of the Missouri - Arkansas state line along the western side of the Missouri Bootheel . - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces.

Not so one traveller, who decided he had to be on the aeroplane from Madrid to the Canary Islands last Friday. A video, shot by airport workers and posted on Facebook, shows the unidentified man clutching his bags and jumping off an air bridge – the extendable corridor that connects airport departure gates with plane doors – and on to the asphalt of Barajas airport in the hope of reaching his plane in time. “This is how passengers in Madrid behave when they don’t arrive in time to catch their planes,” read the post. “This particular passenger missed his Ryanair flight and, however incredible it may seem, got through the different security procedures that [Spain’s airport authority] Aena has in place at its airports.” The poster went on to note that Spain is on its second highest anti-terror alert level. A spokesman for Aena confirmed the incident had taken place at about 9pm on 5 August. “The passenger had reached the gate with his boarding pass after clearing security,” he said. “He broke through a fire escape, the doors opened and he got out that way.” Although the alarm was sounded and the Guardia Civil were called, he added, the man still managed to board his flight and get to Gran Canaria, where he was arrested by police. The spokesman stressed that the man, who has not been named, had passed the required security checks, adding: “This person had cleared security and had no terrorist motivations. He was never suspected of being a terrorist.” The Guardia Civil said that while the man had been stopped by airport workers and told to wait for the police, he had not done so. “It seems that he got on to the tarmac because he’d missed his flight but the plane he was trying to get on wasn’t his,” said a spokeswoman. “When he realised that, he got on the flight to Gran Canaria.” The spokeswoman said that after being questioned by officers on the island, the man had been released but would still face punishment.

Then they put a bag tag on our bag but the date was unreadable, ( picture below) so I decided to ask the staff why no date appears in the manual bag tag. She said ok then she put 10.

This is a 10tn market in which companies sell debt to investors for set terms averaging about eight years. The market has doubled in size in the past decade, swelled by cheap money after years of low interest rates. At the same time, banks - the market-makers for these assets, or traditional shop front - have cut their holdings. The Bank of England estimates there has been a 75% reduction in the bond inventories of dealers in the marketplace since 2008. This means that buying or selling bonds could become harder, which could in turn lead to larger pricing swings. Why does this matter? As the market has grown, credit mutual funds have tripled in size since the 2008 financial crisis. And as savers have searched for better returns, many have put their money into these funds rather than accept the fractions of percent of interest available from traditional bank accounts. Looming on the horizon is a potential interest rate increase in the UK - one in the US is likely to be sooner - and this normally spells bad news for bond prices. So why is liquidity the big issue? Regulations and capital requirements mean it is now \\"very expensive to carry inventories\\" for corporate debt, says Soren Willemann, head of European credit strategy at Barclays. Inventories have been in a slow decline since 2009, he adds. What makes corporate bonds a different market from shares is while a company may have one share-denoting ownership, it could issue dozens of types of bond, meaning keeping an inventory of bonds is harder. Jim Leaviss, head of retail fixed interest at M&G Investments, overseeing about £50bn of investments, says the drop in inventory is due to stricter bank regulations. \\"For US investment banks in particular, regulation has meant that more capital is needed to own an inventory of bonds. The regulation is to make investment banks smaller,\\" he says. There are similar effects on banks globally as part of an effort by policymakers to make banks safer. For Citi's credit strategist Matt King, all this is part of a broader picture. \\"There are several complicated and interlocking issues,\\" he says. Low interest rates have \\"herded investors\\" into making investment that they may not have made otherwise, Mr King says, because investors are searching for high returns - and there are few to find. More companies have issued bonds, accommodating that new cash. But rather than spend it on new jobs and growth, a lot of the companies' money has funded share buybacks. If investors leave this market with their money - for instance as central banks raise interest rates - Mr King says \\"no-one knows precisely how this will work\\". \\"There is concern about bank regulation putting dealers under pressure. Most of the evidence shows dealers have become more efficient. \\"There's always this nagging doubt\\" that the money may leave as quickly as it arrived, say as savers who shunned cash ISAs pile money into bond funds and then leave when rates rise. He advises mutual funds to keep cash available should savers want to withdraw money. With mutual funds now holding such a large amount of corporate borrowing, \\"it begs the question: who is the dealer of last resort?\\" if funds are left holding long-dated bonds and should their clients withdraw money, Mr King asks. It's a big question. On Monday, Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive Martin Gilbert called for central banks to consider stepping in should the corporate bond market collapse, thus performing a similar role to its lender of last resort for banks. The funds aren't at risk of default because they aren't themselves borrowing, so they can hold long-dated bonds if their clients leave, but they may have to sell to pay them off, Mr King says. And selling in an illiquid market can lead to parting with bonds cheaply and depressing prices. \\"Different central banks take different views\\" on whether to step in, Mr King says. \\"Nobody knows how this would work\\", he adds, because of the difficulty in pricing bonds objectively in a crisis. When central banks back a bank, they can use economic assumptions to work out the value of their mortgage book, for example. With corporate bonds - issued by companies which can default - the maths becomes harder. Chris Higham, lead manager of Aviva's £2.7bn Corporate and Strategic Bond Funds, says that to an extent, central banks have already stepped into the corporate market, with the European Central Bank adding a limited amount of corporate bonds in the summer to its own QE bond-buying programme. More could be added, which would help hold up valuations. Fund managers, for their part, are fighting back. Corporate bond fund managers have to decide if they buy a bond they may now have to keep hold of it until maturity, says M&G's Mr Leaviss. Keeping more cash, government bonds and using derivatives is helping, he says. \\"Sudden regressive rate rises around the world\\" could be a worry \\"but the first mitigant against that is the Fed and others have spent the last two years warning people in advance, this will happen slowly,\\" he says. If the worst comes to the worst, fund managers are permitted to suspend dealing, rather than sell their holdings for a pittance to the detriment of their clients, Mr Leaviss adds. Michael Matthews, who helps manage the £5bn Invesco Perpetual Corporate Bond Fund, said his firm is holding more cash, government bonds and bonds that are just about to mature. Doing this \\"could prove to be as much an opportunity as a risk. In other words, those investors with cash, at a time when others are being forced to sell bonds, may be able to drive attractive bargains\\", he says. Mr Matthews points to two crises - the financial crisis of 2008 and the euro crisis of 2011 - where \\"in both of those examples investors did not radically alter the pattern of their behaviour. In other words, we did not see large-scale redemptions\\". Mr King says this logic should be turned on its head to best understand the problem at hand. Some of these bouts of volatility are concerning, but they are not the problem in and of themselves. \\"We've had all these wobbles without any real reasons for anybody to rush for the exit, so the potential for volatility if there is a real reason to rush for the exit is much, much greater,\\" he says. What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about the corporate bond market, where companies sell debt to investors for a set time, usually around eight years. The market has grown a lot, and people have put a lot of money into it. However, there might be some problems. If interest rates go up, bond prices might fall, and people might want to take their money out. Banks have fewer bonds now, so selling them could be harder and cause bigger price changes. This might cause problems for mutual funds (where people pool their money to invest together). They might need to sell their bonds to give money back to people, but if it's hard to sell, they might have to sell them cheap, and that could make prices drop more. People are trying to find ways to fix these issues, but it's still a big question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gregory James \\"Greg\\" LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is an American former professional road racing cyclist who won the Road Race World Championship twice (1983 and 1989) and the Tour de France three times (1986, 1989 and 1990). He is also an entrepreneur and anti-doping advocate. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, near Reno. He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations. LeMond is a longtime vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France. LeMond received intense criticism in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's Tour success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari. His outspokenness placed him in the center of the anti-doping controversy. LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari, and has pointed out that doping products ultimately victimize the professional cyclists who make use of them. Said LeMond: \\"When I speak out about doping people could translate it and think it was about the riders. Actually I feel like I am an advocate for the riders. I look at them as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.\\" LeMond's most notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong and Floyd Landis. He has also been critical of Alberto Contador, the UCI, and its former president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond: \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" McQuaid rejected LeMond's call for new leadership and was dismissive of LeMond. Ultimately McQuaid was defeated in his bid for a third term by British Cycling president Brian Cookson at the September 2013 UCI Congress in Florence, Italy. Lemond had supported Cookson in the UCI Presidential battle. Why did he feel a change was needed?","completion":"Greg LeMond felt that a change was needed at the head of leadership for the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) because he believed that the organization was not doing enough to address the problem of doping in the sport of cycling. He was particularly concerned about the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs and the relationships between riders and unethical sports doctors, which he believed led to the corruption of riders. In a quote from the article, LeMond said, \\"It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.\\" He was driven by a desire to lead cycling out of the mire of doping and create a more transparent, democratic, and accountable organization focused on the best interests of the riders and the sport as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I lost my beloved step son in Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone. I have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he, like his older brother, has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is. My stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son. There is nothing I can do about those who are in, or now gone, but I have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in YET. I desperately want him to do so informed, none of the others did. Pleases help me with this. The movie documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen. I need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late. BUT: ( do not laugh )I NEED my mother to see this first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not simply the idea of them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son, my youngest nephew, watch it too. Then, my nephew might begin to take this seriously. ((( is there another time when this will be shown on TV ? if so please tell me when ? ))) However, my problem is, my mother does not own a DVD player, she still uses video ( is that correct? with tapes ? ) So, I need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film. Can I purchase this from anyone in that form? If not, is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone? Is there any legitimate link from which I can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so who would I contact. I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link. Or,if you have any alternative ideas I will consider anything you can suggest. Please help me, I have lost one very precious adored and loved one already, I already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and I may loose him too. I cannot loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation. Please help me. I will happily call you, email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information. Thank you so much for any help you can offer.

The reviewer, Lori Swanberg, is desperately trying to find a way to show the movie documentary \\"The Ground Truth\\" to her family members in a format they can access (specifically a tape) to help them understand the realities and consequences of serving in the military. Lori has a deep concern for her nephews and their potentially idealized view of military service, as she lost her beloved stepson in Iraq and has another nephew soon to be deployed. Her urgency and the emotional weight behind her words suggest that she is determined to ensure that her remaining family members are informed about the military experience before any further harm befalls them. Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on persuading her mother and, subsequently, her brother and nephew to watch the film. Lori believes that doing so will help them approach this critical decision in their lives with a more grounded and realistic understanding of what serving in the military entails. She is also looking for suggestions or alternative ways to make the documentary available to her family members.

There is so much wrong with the film you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This movie had so much potential to be good, but ultimately made nothing of it. The characters were as dumb as one can be; for the entire movie you're just asking yourself \\"why would you do that?\\" or \\"what's your point in doing this?\\"...this is how illogical and stupid the characters are. We get NO background into them, so naturally you really don't give a rats as about their fate...you could only laugh at their stupidity. - The 'slut' (Marcy) for instance... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in that....its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. - Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first? - Why didn't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start? Movie would've been over that way....besides, they ended up killing him anyway. - Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they had to walk? 'No, I'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected (one a blink away from death) to finally opt to walk outta there. - What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit, only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY! I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an aquaintance to these idiots. I don't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie. In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for, and he replied that 'its for the niggers'. In the end of the film, 3 young Blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in a du-rag no less) go into the store....come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting. THEN, he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they're his homeboys. Okay, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!? How tasteless can one be, what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie? I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial 'Nigger' comment. It was a tasteless, pointless remark. My question to the filmmakers: what was the point of the ending with the Black kids? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier? To smooth things over with Black viewers, by making a joke out of it? Well, I for one, did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit. The whole movie was a joke....a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that shouldn't be given the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good? What film was HE looking at?

Summarize: When buying some Calpol in a large pharmacy chain, the poster said she had discovered, to her \\"amazement\\" that \\"if you register your details under the 'minor ailments scheme', all medicines etc for children are free\\". She added: \\"They are not allowed to advertise it, but you can save a small fortune on Calpol, Piriton, Sudocrem, plasters etc. I wish I had known eight years ago!\\" So, is it true? For a start, pharmacists would not prescribe Calpol. In some areas, they might give you the generic, unbranded equivalent, which is much cheaper and therefore less costly to the NHS. Plasters are not on the list of hand-outs either. Dressings for minor burns perhaps - but not children's plasters. So let's rewind a little. What help can pharmacists offer when it comes to common health problems? The \\"minor ailments scheme\\" provides the answer. It has been around for about 10 years in some local pharmacies. It is aimed at those who can't afford to pay for certain medicines or who can't access their GP easily. The idea is that local pharmacists take some of the pressure off busy GPs and packed A&E departments, by offering over-the-counter advice and consultations. This is particularly useful when GP practices are closed, in the evenings and at weekends, when pharmacies are often open. The scheme should enable people to get treatment or advice more quickly and more easily. The type of ailments they can treat may include coughs, colds, headaches, hay fever, insect bites and stings, eczema, earache and diarrhoea. So if you have a child with a high temperature on a Saturday afternoon (when else?), you can visit your local pharmacist to seek advice. The pharmacist will need to see the child, of course, and will then decide if prescribing a medicine is necessary. If you're elderly and worried about what you can safely take for a cold with other prescription medicines, then your pharmacist should also be the first port of call. The rules on paying for what's prescribed are not always straightforward. In general, if you don't pay for prescriptions - and children under 16 and adults over 60 don't - you will probably receive them free of charge, on the NHS, just as you would from a GP. If you normally pay a prescription charge, then you will be charged for this service too. But this doesn't apply to all minor ailment schemes, because they are not all the same across the country. In Scotland, all community pharmacies run the scheme, but in England, Wales and Northern Ireland the scheme is run by the NHS locally, so it won't be available everywhere. Some areas only provide the service free to parents who receive low-income related benefits. Other NHS areas may not fund dressings or provide anything for children who present with coughs and colds. To find out what your local scheme offers, it is advisable to contact your nearest pharmacy and ask. Neal Patel, from the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says people shouldn't get carried away. \\"You can't just walk into a pharmacy and stock up on Calpol for your kids. That's not the way it works.\\" Pharmacists, he says, have to make sure the treatment is appropriate, following a consultation similar to one carried out by a GP. If pharmacists aren't sure what they are dealing with or if a patient has a more serious concern, they will be referred to their GP. Ash Soni, a pharmacist in Streatham, south London, who runs the scheme in his pharmacy, said he often acts as kind of patient filter for GPs. \\"It's an opportunity for people to just walk in on the day and see a pharmacist for advice, rather than waiting for a GP appointment.\\" But he isn't there to hand out medicines, he explains. \\"You'll get it only if you need it.\\" In case the public is unsure what the minor ailment service is, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) has produced an animated video to explain more. The NHS Choices website has more information on common problems your pharmacist can help with and a way of searching for pharmacies in your local area to find out if they offer the service. The minor ailments scheme is clearly not widely known about because these web pages have experienced a massive rise in hits in the past week or so. NHS Choices told the BBC that the search term \\"minor ailments scheme\\" went from being outside the top 10,000 to the fifth most popular in the space of a few days. And research suggests the scheme, if rolled out nationally, could save the NHS in the region of Â£1bn. This is because the cost of a consultation with a GP is nearly three times higher than the cost of a consultation with a community pharmacist. So as long as the scheme is not abused and we use the pharmacists' service responsibly, the permanently cash-strapped NHS should benefit in the long run.","completion":"A mom found out that if you join the \\"minor ailments scheme\\" at a pharmacy, they can give some medicines for children for free.

Ask a question about Freemasonry.","completion":"What role does the symbolism and ritual have in Freemasonry, and how do these contribute to its character as a fraternal organization? Freemasonry is an ancient and global fraternal organization with a complex history, principles, and practices. Central to the experience of Freemasonry is the use of symbolism and ritual, which are incorporated throughout all aspects of the organization. These elements serve multiple purposes to provide a sense of connection, understanding, and growth for its members. 1. Symbolism in Freemasonry: Freemasonry is rich in symbolism, which is employed to communicate deeper meanings and encourage introspection among its members. Symbolism in Freemasonry can be found in its emblems, teachings, and the design of lodge rooms. - Common Symbols: Some well-known symbols in Freemasonry include the square and compasses, the letter \\"G\\" found within this emblem (representing God or the Grand Architect of the Universe), the all-seeing eye, the sun, the moon, and various architectural tools. - Connection to deeper meanings: These symbols are not mere decorations, but rather representations of deeper philosophical insights, moral values, or spiritual concepts meant to foster personal growth among the members. For example, the square signifies moral rectitude and uprightness, while the compasses signify the importance of keeping one's passions and desires within due bounds. - Universal language: The use of symbols in Freemasonry also serves as a universal language that transcends linguistic barriers, allowing members from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds to communicate and understand each other on a deeper level. 2. Rituals in Freemasonry: Ritual plays a crucial role in the experience of Freemasonry. From initiation ceremonies to the regular meetings of the lodges, these rituals are an integral part of the Masonic tradition. - Degrees and Initiations: Freemasonry is divided into a series of degrees or steps, each marked by a ritual ceremony. These ceremonies involve a series of allegorical dramas that are both symbolic and highly structured, and which serve to convey moral lessons, philosophical insights, and continued learning to the initiates. - Bonding and Brotherhood: Rituals also serve to create a strong sense of camaraderie, bonding, and brotherhood among members. The shared experiences and common purpose fostered by these rituals help to unite members, build relationships, and develop a unique sense of identity as Freemasons. - Preservation of Tradition: The consistent use of ritual in Freemasonry also preserves and perpetuates the teachings and traditions of the order. These rituals, lectures, and symbols have been passed down through generations, which helps to maintain stability and continuity within the organization. In conclusion, symbolism and ritual are vital components of the Freemason experience that provide a sense of connection, understanding, and growth for its members. Not only do they serve as a means for teaching moral lessons and spiritual truths, but they also foster a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support among Freemasons. The use of symbols and rituals in Freemasonry allows members to articulate and share a common set of values, principles, and practices, thus contributing significantly to the organization's character and purpose as a fraternal society."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Please answer the following question: Not exactly. I have no problem with divorce since, as others have stated, everyone has their reasons, however there was one person that I dated briefly but upon hearing the reason why he divorced I opted to end the relationship. I remember, we were having brunch and were talking about our past relationships and what happened. He brought up his marriage. I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette! And when he finally finished the tale of his cheating adventures I asked him if he regretted cheating on his wife with so many women, His answer? “Oh Definitely.” Oh good! So at least he regrets his actions, right? Or he’s at least a little sorry about it> Wrong. “One of the reasons I regret not divorcing her sooner. Had I divorced her sooner, I wouldn’t have to have cheated on her so much. But it is what it is and, well, I was unhappy.” I have no problems with divorced men.

Intrigued: She is probably intrigued in the beginning, as she is getting to know this person and their past relationships, including his marriage and the reasons for his divorce. This curiosity is natural when discussing personal experiences in relationships. 2. Annoyed: The woman is likely annoyed by the man's casual attitude towards his own infidelity and the way he discusses his past indiscretions. Her annoyance could stem from the fact that he does not seem remorseful or regretful for the wrong he committed, and his justification of cheating as a consequence of his unhappiness in the marriage. 3. Concerned: The woman is also probably concerned about the possibility of being involved with someone who has a history of cheating and does not seem to have learned from it, or display any remorse. This could make her question his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to remain faithful in their relationship. 4. Disappointed: Ultimately, the woman might be feeling disappointed in the man she was getting to know and had been dating. His nonchalant attitude and lack of remorse for his actions could shatter her expectations and cause her to re-evaluate her interest in their relationship.

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works.

David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which period would see more trapped terrestrial radiation, time A or time B? Answer:","completion":"Time B would see more trapped terrestrial radiation. Justification: The amount of terrestrial radiation trapped in the earth's atmosphere is directly linked with the concentration of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, have the ability to trap heat radiated from the earth's surface, preventing it from escaping to space. This in turn increases the temperature of the earth, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. According to the paragraph, Time A signifies the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, while Time B represents the present century with more greenhouse gases. Drawing from this information, it can be inferred that in Time B, with higher concentration of greenhouse gases, more terrestrial radiation would be trapped in the atmosphere compared to Time A. This is due to the more pronounced greenhouse effect occurring in Time B due to increased volumes of greenhouse gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose tea again. Sullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags. However, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea. This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.

Answer the following question: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose mother died early in his life? James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 1794. His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of 9,000 (equal to 147,307 today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's Encyclopedia in 1820; an engraving of General Andrew Jackson by Longacre based on a portrait by Thomas Sully achieved wide sales. Longacre then agreed to engrave illustrations for Joseph and John Sanderson's Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration...

The link between sleep deprivation and psychosis was further documented in 2007 through a study at Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley. The study revealed, using MRI scans, that sleep deprivation causes the brain to become incapable of putting an emotional event into the proper perspective and incapable of making a controlled, suitable response to the event. What's the best answer to this question: can you get psychosis from lack of sleep?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the information given From the information provided, it is clear that there is a link between sleep deprivation and the risk of developing serious diseases such as heart disease and mental illness, including psychosis and bipolar disorder. The 2007 study conducted by Harvard Medical School and the University of California at Berkeley revealed that sleep deprivation affects the brain's ability to put emotional events into the proper perspective and to make controlled, appropriate responses to those events. Step 2: Consider the specific question The question asks whether one can get psychosis from lack of sleep. Although there is a connection between sleep deprivation and psychosis, it's important to consider if lack of sleep directly causes psychosis or if it is just a factor contributing to the development of the condition. Step 3: Analyze the evidence for causation While the studies mentioned show a link between sleep deprivation and the development of psychosis, they do not state explicitly that lack of sleep is the sole cause of psychosis. However, sleep deprivation can contribute to the brain's impaired ability to process emotional events and respond to them, which might exacerbate the risk of developing psychosis. Step 4: Formulate the best answer Based on the analysis of the information and taking into account both the link and the potential contributing factors, the best answer to the question would be: While lack of sleep does not directly cause psychosis in every instance, sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of developing mental illnesses like psychosis and bipolar disorder. Since sleep deprivation affects the brain's ability to process and respond to emotional events, it is a crucial factor in maintaining good mental health and minimizing the risk of developing conditions like psychosis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we want to move the smaller term, which is 3*c, to the other side. To do that, subtract 3*c from both sides. 3*c - 3*c = 13*c - 3*c + 250 0 = 10*c + 250 Step 3: Isolate c by getting rid of the constant term, 250. Subtract 250 from both sides. 0 - 250 = 10*c + 250 - 250 -250 = 10*c Step 4: Solve for c by dividing both sides by the coefficient of c, which is 10. c = (-250) / 10 Step 5: Simplify the expression. c = -25 The solution to the equation 3*c = 13*c + 273 - 23 is c = -25."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was a considerable influence on Handel in the three years that he spent in Hamburg?, what is it ?

Saudi Arabian Women Love Bumper Cars (But Not for Bumping) JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia—Joudi al-Omeri drove in circles. And when cars came in her direction, she swerved. These were electric bumper cars, but in Saudi Arabia, the ride doesn’t always live up to its name. “I come here to drive,” said Ms. al-Omeri, a 27-year-old homemaker still giddy from the roughly five-minute, mostly crash-free ride in her red-and-green two-seater. “It’s much better than bumping against others,” she adds. At the weekly ladies-only night at the Al Shallal Theme Park in the coastal city of Jeddah, women discard head scarves and head-to-toe black gowns to reveal the latest trends—ripped jeans, tank tops, and tossed-to-the-side ’80s-style hair. For many of them, the biggest draw of the amusement park isn’t the few hours of fashion freedom. Instead, they go there to get behind the wheel—even a bumper-car wheel—in a country that bans female drivers. There are no loud bangs or ferocious head-on crashes. There are a few slow-speed collisions, but also a lot of dodging, as many women are content with just gliding over the smooth surface. For some, the biggest risk of bumping into each other is while taking a selfie. “They love driving the cars,” Aman al-Abadi, the ride attendant, said of the women who were getting back in line for another spin. “Men are always bumping.” With the exception of remote corners of the desert kingdom—where Bedouin women sometimes get behind the wheel—the amusement park offers a rare, hassle-free environment for women to hone their driving skills. That is partly why, on ladies nights, there is a winding queue at the bumper cars. Outside the theme park, activists, writers and even some politicians now are pushing to lift the ban on driving actual cars. One of the strongest cases proponents make is financial: Many women, even those with jobs, simply can’t afford a driver. In this conservative society, there are many who resist it, warning that allowing women to move freely without a male guardian would expose them to social evils and personal trouble. Among them is Mohammed Bayea, who on mixed-gender evening at the amusement park was happily driving alongside several women on the crowded bumper-car platform. There was the occasional knock, but for the most part men and women steered clear of each other. The women wore traditional dress. “It’s OK if they drive here,” said Mr. Bayea, a Riyadh native who was on vacation in Jeddah. But he said he wouldn’t want them driving in the real world. “I am a nice guy, I don’t flirt with women. But other men will.” The driving ban has helped lead to the flourishing of ride-hailing apps by companies like Uber Technologies Inc., which recently announced it received a 3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. While women at Saudi Arabia’s amusement parks often seek a driving experience that mirrors crash-avoidance reality, men relish bashing into each other. When they take to the bumper cars, their goal—like pretty much everywhere else in the world—is to gather speed for maximum impact. When it comes time for the women to drive in a mixed-gender theme park in the town of Abha, a big black curtain goes up around the bumper car platform to shield the female drivers from outside view. The cars resume driving in circles and the platform becomes placid again. Some women have unwittingly breached the no-bumping etiquette. When, for the first time in years, Arwa al-Neami went on the bumper cars in the theme park in Abha, she decided to chase the other female drivers. She got a lot of angry shouting in return. “They would scream: ‘Please, don’t bump me! I am trying to drive!’ ” says Ms. al-Neami, a Jeddah-based artist who began documenting the phenomenon in 2014 as part of an art project called Never Never Land. Some women viewed the bumper car for what it was: Amusement. “It’s just a game,” said Darin Twergi, a student, with a shrug. “It’s not that big a deal if I drive or not.” Others regard time spent in a brightly colored open-top vehicle with a hot rod attached to the ceiling as a serious practice session. Before she moved abroad for university, Sama bin Mahfooz said she would go to the theme park in Jeddah especially to drive. “We never get a chance to in Saudi Arabia—this is the right place to do it,” says Ms. bin Mahfooz, 20. “Whenever my best friend would hit me, I would tell her: ‘No, let me drive, let me drive!’ ” Her wealthier friends were less interested. They would say “we have drivers, we don’t need to do that,” she recalls. In a country where only 23% of Saudi women have jobs, ladies-only nights bring women out in force. Every employee is in fact a woman, from the popcorn sellers to the security guards to the bumper car attendant. The men have the night off. And while cinemas are normally banned, there are two of them in Al Shallal alone. Granted, the movies last under five minutes, and the experience is really just about the special effects: 3-D screens, seats that jolt and sprays of water. For many women, the biggest attraction of ladies nights is simply a man-free world. One woman says she goes every week, ostensibly to accompany her teenage daughters. “The girls can wear what they want and roam around freely,” said Nadia Shamsaan, 33. “But I also come here to relax,” she added, sprawled on an outdoor sofa in a patterned shirt and jeans. Outside the park, reality hits. The women step out in their all-covering abayas to find a tangle of traffic that snarls around its perimeter. The men have come to pick them up. Many of the female bumper car drivers confide they would like to sit on the driver’s seat outside the park’s high walls, too. Some of them say, secretly, they already have. Ms. al-Omeri, the homemaker, says with pride: “I’ve driven in the desert.” Write to Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.com What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the popularity of bumper cars among Saudi Arabian women, who are not allowed to drive in their country.

Movie plot title: Little Big Man Movie plot: In the present day 1970, 121-year-old Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman), who resides in a hospice, is recounting his long and colorful life story to a curious historian (William Hickey). Among other things, Crabb claims to have been a captive of the Cheyenne, a gunslinger, an associate of Wild Bill Hickok, a scout for General George Armstrong Custer, and the sole survivor of Custer's force at the 1876 Battle of Little Bighorn. Having been adopted by the Cheyenne and reared in their culture, Crabb has perspective on both Caucasian and Native American life in the 19th century.Flashing back to 1859, the 10-year-old Jack and his older sister Caroline (Carole Androsky) survive the massacre of their parents' wagon train by the hostile Pawnee. Found by a Cheyenne warrior, Jack and his sister are taken back to a Cheyenne village. Caroline manages to escape on horseback, but Jack is reared by good-hearted tribal leader Old Lodge Skins (Chief Dan George). Life among the Cheyenne proves to be idyllic, though Jack unwittingly makes an enemy of another boy, Younger Bear (Cal Bellini). However, Younger Bear eventually owes his life to Jack, who saves him from a Pawnee warrior. Jack is given the name \\"Little Big Man\\" because he's short but very brave.In 1865, when Jack is 16, he is captured by U.S. cavalry troopers after skirmish between them and the local Cheyenne. Jack then renounces his Native American upbringing in order to save himself from being killed. After his interrogation and debriefing, and being that he is still a minor, he is put in the care of Reverend Silas Pendrake (Thayer David) and his sexually frustrated wife, Louise (Faye Dunaway), who tries to seduce Jack. Jack cannot accept the contradiction between Louise's piety and sexual appetite. When Jack finds Louise one day seducing the owner of a local soda shop/pharmacy, he leaves the Pendrake household.A year or so later, Jack becomes the apprentice of the snake-oil salesman Merriweather (Martin Balsam).

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive. Question: \\"What requirements was Al Qaeda able to meet by spring and summer of 2000?\\" Answer: \\"Requirements to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation\\" Is this answer correct? OPT: + no; + yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"yes.

These requirements, as mentioned in the passage, included the ability to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation. Other requirements were effective communication, recruitment and training of personnel, intelligence gathering and assessment, moving people, and raising and moving funds. The passage provides evidence that al Qaeda met these requirements by describing how the core operatives were prepared and facilitated to carry out the 9/11 attacks."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: - title is governor urban development chairman and president of american motors corporation of michigan united states secretary of housing and - president is richard nixon - party is republican - predecessor is john swainson robert coldwell wood george w. mason - lieutenant is william g. milliken - birth date is 8 july 1907 - birthname is george wilcken romney - profession is automobile executive politician - alt is headshot is directly facing the camera of a greying man in a suit who - blank is positions - caption is romney while u.s. secretary of housing and urban development - resting place is fairview cemetery - order is 43rd 3rd - death date is 26 july 1995 - spouse is lenore romney - term end is january 1962 22 , 1969 january 20 , 1973 february - birth place is colonia dublán , galeana , chihuahua , mexico - death place is bloomfield hills , michigan - successor is william g. milliken james thomas lynn roy abernethy - data is chairman manager american motors & nbsp ; -lrb- 1954 -- 1962 & -rrb- thinsp ; / & thinsp ; general - imagesize is 220px - children is lynn romney keenan jane romney g. scott romney w. mitt - term start is january 1954 1 , 1963 january 22 , 1969 october - image is george w. romney official portrait.jpg - religion is the mormon -rrb- church of jesus christ of latter-day saints -lrb- Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Please answer the following question: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows: How would you define creativity? What does it mean to you to be an artist? Do you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy? Change and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography. You seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like “Dark Matter”, “Touching Infinity”, “We are made of Stars”, “Rising tides” and “A drop in the ocean” or “Alchemy”. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences? What continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist? We both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire’s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire’s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September.

As if any further evidence were needed that bald results scalp plain reason in football, it has been forthcoming in the reaction to two matches this midweek. The 4-0 defeat of Manchester United’s virtual reserve team at MK Dons provided an eye-popping score-line, sure enough. But it is not by a headlining exit from that little old cup, which changes its identity more often than Spurs swap managers, that Louis van Gaal will be judged. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: A new team is not built in one month Don for: Anderson and his Manchester United team-mates look forlorn at stadium:mk Had","completion":"Sir Alex Ferguson presided over an emphatic defeat in an early-stage domestic cup fixture during his long tenure - which is not to equate Van Gaal’s embryonic phase with the revolutionary reign of Manchester United’s grand master - that would have been dismissed as an aberration more than anything else. Instead, in this era of instant gratification and knee-jerk reactions, football fans and pundits alike have been quick to crucify the Dutchman for a result that, while undoubtedly embarrassing for a club of Manchester United's stature, has been blown out of proportion. The Capital One Cup - that little old cup referred to in the text - is often deemed as the lowest of the four major English football competitions, and as such is habitually utilized as an opportunity for top-tier clubs to afford playing time to their highly-talented youth and backup players. It is certainly not a barometer of long-term success or a manager's tactical acumen. Furthermore, Van Gaal has an extremely limited time to understand and evaluate the merits and weaknesses of his vast squad. It was only one month since he officially took over, as he himself stated in the video referenced in the question. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither can a great football team in the demanding Premier League. He is renowned for his rebuilding of teams and nurturing of talents, as evident in his impactful careers at Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and, most recently, the highly-impressive Netherlands national team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Moreover, Van Gaal was attempting to implement a new philosophy and a distinctive style of play on a team that suffered a deplorable and morale-draining season. The prior campaign had been replete with disappointments, with the post-Ferguson era kicking off under the largely hapless leadership of manager David Moyes. Moyes departed before the season ended, and it fell to Ryan Giggs to steer the ship as interim manager. Thus, Van Gaal inherited a fractured and demoralized squad, bloated with ill-fitting signings and a dearth of obvious leaders on the pitch or in the dressing room. Some envisioned him as a messianic figure who would wipe away the previous season's woes simply with his arrival, but the reality is that the rebuilding process he faced was as complicated as it was essential. It is essential to bear in mind the context in which he took charge of Manchester United – a club still reeling from a poor 2013-2014 season and coping with the irreplaceable loss of Sir Alex. In this scenario, hyper-focusing on one poor result in a lesser cup competition is inappropriate and misguided, for his true work lies ahead in the more significant arena of the Premier League and European competitions. Indeed, Van Gaal's eventual success, or failure, should not hinge on sporadic results during his fledgling tenure. Rather, he must be assessed on the progress made in building a new and cohesive team over time, on his capacity to inspire belief in his players, and on his ability to steer Manchester United back to the pinnacle of English and European football. In the grand scheme of things, the 4-0 defeat to MK Dons will be seen as nothing more than a mere blip in the early days of a manager well-versed in systematically turning teams into winners. Football fans and critics alike would do well to practice patience and witness the extended consequences before rushing to condemn a manager of Van Gaal's considerable pedigree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When asked why he got sent back, Moe says he couldn't deal with the couple after their supposed talk of chores and cleaning... Answer:","completion":"From the movie plot described above, there are several possible questions that can be generated. Here are examples of a few: 1. What is the main theme of the movie? Based on the described plot, the movie seems to deal with themes of friendship, abandonment, and adaptation to change. It tells a story of three boys, Moe, Larry and Curly, navigating their life in an orphanage, dealing with the harsh realities of their situation, and their struggle with separation when one of them is chosen for adoption. 2. How does Moe react when he is adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Harter and separated from his friends? Moe initially is delighted about being adopted, clearly excited about the prospect of having a family. However, as he leaves his friends behind, he begins to miss them intensely. When given an opportunity to ask for a birthday gift, he selflessly requests for his friends, Larry and Curly, to be adopted as well. This is a powerful depiction of the bond they share and Moe's inherent loyalty. 3. What turn does the story take when Moe asks Mr. and Mrs. Harter to adopt Larry and Curly on his birthday? In an ironic twist of events, when Moe asks the Harters to go back and adopt Larry and Curly, they end up returning Moe back to the orphanage instead and adopting a smaller, more adorable boy named Teddy. When asked why he got sent back, Moe gives a humorous reason saying he could not deal with the couple after their supposed talk of chores and cleaning. 4. How does the movie portray the transition of the relationship between the boys and the nuns as they grow up? The plot shows that the nuns' affection for the boys changes over time. Initially, they adore the boys and agree to split their time with them. However, ten years later, the nuns are terrified of spending time with the boys. This reveals a dynamic shift in the characters' relationships due to the boys' behaviors and the trials they cause for the nuns. 5. What are some of the standout comedic elements present in the movie plot? The plot features several comedic elements characteristic of the original Stooges. From the way baby Moe, Larry, and Curly's introduction involves a classic eye-poke gag to the farcical attempt to remove Sister Mary-Mengele’s tooth, and Moe taking a part of Larry's hair and Curly's nose hair as a keepsake, the story is filled with physical comedy and slapstick humor."},{"prompt":"Context: Jan started a blog yesterday to make money and it already has a million hits.

What is the best way to: Wash your car.","completion":"The best way to wash your car involves carefully following multiple steps to ensure a thorough and damage-free cleaning. Here's a step-by-step guide on the best way to wash your car: 1. Gather necessary materials: Before starting, gather all the materials you will need. This includes a car-washing soap, a bucket, a hose with a nozzle, a microfiber wash mitt, a microfiber drying towel, a soft-bristle brush or sponge, and a car wax or sealant for added protection. 2. Choose a location: Select a shaded and flat area to wash your car. Washing in direct sunlight can cause the soap to dry on the car, leaving streaks and residue. 3. Rinse the car: Begin by rinsing the entire car with a hose to remove loose dirt and debris. This helps prevent scratching the paint during the washing process. 4. Prepare the cleaning solution: Fill a bucket with water and follow the car-washing soap instructions to create a soap and water solution. This mixture is specifically designed for cleaning cars without damaging the paint. 5. Wash the car: Starting at the top and working your way down, use a microfiber wash mitt soaked in the soap and water solution to clean the car. Rinse the mitt frequently in a separate bucket of water to remove dirt and avoid scratching the paint. 6. Clean the wheels and tires: After washing the body, use a soft-bristle brush or sponge to clean the wheels and tires. Use a dedicated wheel cleaner if necessary. Make sure to clean the wheel wells and brake calipers as well. 7. Rinse the car thoroughly: Once the car's exterior has been cleaned, use the hose to rinse off any remaining soap residue, again starting from the top and working your way down. 8. Dry the car: To prevent water spots, quickly dry the car with a clean, microfiber drying towel. Use a blotting technique rather than wiping to help avoid scratching the paint. 9. Apply wax or sealant: Applying a car wax or sealant will provide an extra layer of protection and enhance the paint's shine. Follow the specific product's instructions for application and removal. Typically, this will involve applying the product in a thin layer, allowing it to dry, and then buffing off with a clean microfiber cloth. 10. Clean windows and mirrors: Lastly, clean the windows and mirrors using a glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Be sure to clean both the interior and exterior surfaces. By following these steps, you will be using the best method to wash your car effectively and safely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pick from: [I] Natalie knows less about dealing with cattles.; [II] Emily knows less about dealing with cattles.; Complete the following sentence. Natalie shows Emily how to milk a cow since","completion":"Natalie shows Emily how to milk a cow since Emily knows less about dealing with cattle. Having grown up on a farm, Natalie has extensive experience and knowledge in handling various aspects of livestock management, particularly when it comes to cattle. Over the years, she has developed a strong understanding of animal husbandry, as well as techniques and best practices for managing and caring for cows. On the other hand, Emily hails from an urban background and has limited exposure to farm life, let alone the intricacies of managing large animals like cattle. Her knowledge primarily comes from books, documentaries, and conversations with those experienced in the field, but this theoretical knowledge pales in comparison to Natalie's practical, hands-on experience. Recognizing Emily's curiosity and the gap in her knowledge, Natalie takes it upon herself to teach Emily how to milk a cow. Firstly, she familiarizes Emily with the cow's anatomy and the location of the udder, explaining that this is where the milk is stored. She then demonstrates the proper milking technique, which involves grasping the teats gently yet firmly and using a squeezing motion to extract milk while avoiding injury to the animal. Natalie emphasizes the importance of ensuring cleanliness and hygiene throughout the process, as well as observing the cow's behavior for signs of stress or discomfort. As Emily listens attentively and follows Natalie's instructions, she gradually gains both confidence and skill in milking the cow. Natalie patiently offers her guidance, correcting Emily's technique when needed, and answering her many questions about dairy farming, cow behavior, and the various uses of milk products. Throughout this learning experience, Natalie continues to share valuable insights and tips about cattle management, such as feeding and watering practices, disease prevention, and general maintenance tasks that contribute to the cow's overall health and well-being. In time, Emily gains a deeper appreciation for the hard work, dedication, and expertise required to manage cattle effectively and humanely. She recognizes the value of hands-on learning and experiences like the one Natalie has provided, and is grateful for her guidance and mentorship. Through Natalie's willingness to share her knowledge and skills, Emily becomes more capable in dealing with cattle. This event not only fosters their friendship but also opens up new possibilities for collaboration and learning in the future, as they continue to exchange knowledge about farming, animals, and other aspects of rural living. Ultimately, their shared experiences contribute to their personal growth and help them both navigate challenges that may arise as they pursue their respective passions and aspirations in agriculture and animal husbandry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trivia question: Which region and river in the north of South America, now part of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, gave its name to a sweetener produced from local crops? And the answer is?","completion":"The region and river in the north of South America that gave its name to a sweetener produced from local crops is the Demerara region and the Demerara River. This area is now part of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. The sweetener, known as Demerara sugar, is a type of raw cane sugar that is minimally processed and known for its distinctive large golden-brown sugar crystals. Demerara sugar originated in this region and took its name from the Demarara River, which is a key waterway for transportation and commerce in what was previously a Dutch colony and later became British Guiana before gaining independence as Guyana. The Demerara region is located in the northern part of Guyana and is an area characterized by its fertile, mineral-rich soil. As a result, it has been an important agricultural center for centuries, producing high-quality crops such as sugar cane, rice, and other fruits and vegetables. The Demerara River traverses through this region, providing essential irrigation and serving as a critical transportation route for trade and commerce. Demerara sugar is made from sugar cane grown in the fields along the Demerara River. The sugar cane is harvested and then crushed to extract the sweet juice. This raw sugarcane juice is subsequently heated to evaporate the water, leaving behind a thick, molasses-rich syrup. The sugar crystals are then formed by further heating and cooling the syrup. Once the desired size of sugar crystals is achieved, the molasses is partially removed, leaving a small amount of molasses coating the crystals. This gives Demerara sugar its characteristic golden-brown color and rich, toffee-like flavor. In addition to its unique taste, Demerara sugar has gained popularity as an alternative to traditional white sugar, as it is considered less processed and retains more of the natural molasses found in sugar cane. Today, Demerara sugar is used in various culinary applications, including baking, sweetening beverages, and as a topping for desserts and pastries. In conclusion, the Demerara region and the Demerara River in the north of South America, now part of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, are the source for the name and origin of the Demerara sugar. This sweetener is produced from local sugar cane crops and is characterized by its large golden-brown crystals and rich flavor profile. Demerara sugar continues to be a popular choice for those seeking an alternative to conventional white sugar."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What will happen if Trump wins enough votes to win the electoral college, but electors jump ship and vote for Hillary? Does the Electoral College have the power to reject Trump, or any candidate for that matter, if enough electors decided to change their vote? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information, which is regarding the possibility of electors changing their votes and whether the Electoral College can reject a candidate based on electors' decisions. Let me break it down step-by-step: 1. Understand the context: Both questions are about the role of electors in the US Electoral College system and their potential influence on the outcome of a presidential election. 2. Identify the scenarios: In both questions, the scenario involves electors changing their votes, essentially not voting for the candidate they are pledged to represent. 3. Define the outcomes: The outcome to be determined is whether the Electoral College can reject a candidate, in this case, Trump, based on electors changing their votes. Now, let's address the question: In the United States, the electoral process involves electors casting votes on behalf of the states they represent. These electors are generally expected to cast their votes in line with the popular vote of their respective states. However, there have been instances of \\"faithless electors,\\" who change their vote and do not support the candidate they initially pledged to represent. The Constitution does not explicitly prohibit electors from changing their votes. However, some states have laws that penalize faithless electors or may disqualify them and appoint a new elector to vote as pledged. The degree of enforcement of such laws varies by state, and penalties may be mild, like fines. In the 2016 election, there were seven faithless electors – five who were originally pledged to vote for Hillary Clinton, and two pledged to vote for Trump. This did not have a significant impact on the election's outcome, as Trump still secured enough electoral votes to become President. In theory, if a large number of electors decided to change their votes and vote for a different candidate, it could potentially affect the election outcome. However, this would be an unprecedented situation and could lead to legal battles, public outrage, and constitutional crises since electors are meant to represent the will of the people. In conclusion, the Electoral College could potentially reject a candidate if enough electors change their votes, but this would be an extraordinary and contentious situation. The two questions you asked are indeed inquiring about the same information, mainly the power of electors to influence the outcome of a presidential election by changing their votes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment. They marry, but the composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains) makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception. It is evident he is jealous, and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent. Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto, which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere. It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra, Bertram Gribble (John Abbott), is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius. Suspecting the sabotage of her husband's career, she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not co-operating. A friction develops between Novak and Hollenius, and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novak's temperamental behavior. On the evening of the premiere, Christine visits Hollenius, who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair. Distraught, Christine shoots him dead.

Here are possible answers to this question: - tropical forest - walmart - north america - feild - pet shops I believe the correct choice is \\"pet shops\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"You are correct that the most suitable choice among the given options for purchasing a snake is \\"pet shops.\\" Here's a more detailed explanation: 1. Tropical Forest: Though tropical forests are home to various snake species, it is not advisable to catch a snake from the wild as it may be illegal, dangerous, and harmful to the ecosystem. Moreover, wild-caught snakes can carry diseases, parasites, and may not adapt well to captivity. 2. Walmart: While Walmart sells various products, they do not sell live animals, including snakes. Additionally, purchasing a live animal from a department store presents concerns about the animal's health, proper care, and overall welfare. 3. North America: North America is a continent, not a specific location where one can buy a snake. Although there are snake species native to North America, capturing them from their natural habitat can be harmful and is not recommended. 4. Field: Similar to the tropical forest, identifying a field as a place to buy a snake is not practical. Fields, like forests, provide habitat for different wildlife, but it is not an appropriate or legal place to acquire a snake for a personal collection. 5. Pet Shops: Among the choices provided, pet shops are the most appropriate place to buy a snake. Reputable pet shops sell legally captive-bred snakes that are healthy, well-taken care of, and adaptable to living in captivity. Purchasing from a pet shop ensures that you have access to accurate information about the snake's needs, such as proper care, diet, and husbandry. Additionally, pet shops often have knowledgeable staff who can guide you through the process of snake ownership. Furthermore, you can also consider purchasing a snake from a reputable breeder, animal expos, or online platforms that specialize in reptile sales. This allows you to research the sellers' reputation, obtain thorough information about the snake's background, lineage, and specialized care requirements before making a purchase. Keep in mind that some snake species may require specific permits or licenses due to local laws and regulations.

John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage's romantic partner for most of their lives. In 2012, amongst a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more amongst the city's art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage's Song Books with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of Europeras 1 & 2 in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of Lecture on Nothing created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth. A 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage's birth, titled On Silence: Homage to Cage.

The incident occurred while the flight was attempting to land, only to have its path interrupted by a delayed Virgin flight that was taking off from the same runway. As air traffic controllers scrambled to warn both planes of the potential collision, the deep sense of panic and confusion from passengers was palpable throughout the tense moments that followed. It all began as the Qantas plane was preparing to make its scheduled landing, following an otherwise routine flight. Unbeknownst to the pilots, crew, and passengers, a delayed Virgin flight was in the process of taking off from the same runway, putting both planes on a dangerous collision course. It was not until the air traffic controllers became aware of this potentially life-threatening situation that they issued a safety warning to the pilots of both planes, urging them to take immediate evasive action to avoid a near disaster. Acting quickly, the Qantas flight made a steep climb to ensure that it maintained a safe distance from the Virgin plane, while the Virgin pilot increased the speed of the takeoff to prevent any chance of impact. The sudden change in trajectory and the deployment of the oxygen masks caused immense panic and discomfort among the passengers on board the Qantas flight. Many experienced difficulty breathing and nausea due to the rapid ascent, leading to several instances of vomiting and fainting. In such a chaotic environment, flight attendants had to maintain their composure and provide assistance to panicked passengers who were grappling with the disorienting situation. Meanwhile, on the ground, the air traffic controllers worked tirelessly to monitor the trajectory and distance between the two planes, ensuring that they were no longer at risk of colliding. Thanks to their diligent and swift response, the planes managed to separate safely, and the Qantas flight was able to land without any further complications. As the dust settled and passengers disembarked from the plane, many expressed their gratitude to the pilots, flight attendants, and air traffic controllers for their exceptional response to the situation. Amidst the shock and disbelief, numerous passengers took to social media to share their harrowing experiences and detail the terrifying moment when they believed a collision was all but inevitable. Although several passengers were treated for minor injuries and bouts of sickness brought on by the sudden ascent, there were no fatalities or catastrophic consequences of the near miss. Nevertheless, this incident has raised questions about the protocols and safety measures in place at airports, as well as the overall efficiency of air traffic control systems. As the aviation industry and relevant authorities begin their investigations into the circumstances that led to this terrifying ordeal, many hope that lessons can be learned from this incident to avoid similar situations in the future. For the passengers on board that Qantas flight, however, the memory of the day when they narrowly escaped disaster is sure to remain etched in their minds for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. But I can use this background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Question: A smaller boulder will roll down a hill faster or slower than a larger one? A:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step. Step 1: Understand the concept of momentum The paragraph tells us that an object's momentum depends on its mass and velocity. The greater the mass or velocity, the greater the momentum. Step 2: Relate momentum to the boulders in question We have a smaller boulder and a larger boulder. Since mass is a factor in momentum, the larger boulder has more mass than the smaller one. Step 3: Consider other variables Although not mentioned in the paragraph, we need to address the force of gravity acting on both boulders, as well as their respective friction with the hill surface and any air resistance. We'll assume that these factors are similar for both boulders (e.g., they are rolling down the same hill with the same surface material). Step 4: Analyze the resulting velocities Given that both boulders are subject to the same forces and conditions, the larger boulder's greater mass will result in a greater momentum when rolling down the hill, assuming it also has a similar initial velocity as the smaller boulder. Step 5: Answer the question The paragraph does not directly address the relationship between mass and velocity other than stating greater mass will lead to greater momentum. Based on the information given, we cannot conclude whether the smaller boulder will roll down the hill faster or slower than the larger one.

Despite his fame, Matt often feels lonely and longs for a deeper human connection. Janet, on the other hand, is an aspiring sports journalist hailing from a humble background. Passionate about sports since she was a little girl, Janet possesses deep knowledge and understanding of the game, making her one of the most promising journalists in the field. She's intelligent, quirky, independent, and not one to chase fame. One day, Matt gets injured during a game and is advised to rest for a few weeks from his agent, desperately needing rehabilitation for his knee. Though devastated by the break from sports, he unwillingly agrees to rest, which throws him into a state of boredom. While Matt wallows in his misery, he comes across Janet's insightful articles on sports journalism, particularly her unconventional and genuine perspectives on players and their lives. Her writing resonates with him, sparking an interest in getting to know the journalist behind the words At the same time, Janet, who is looking for her breakthrough as a sports journalist, gets assigned to interview Matt.

Thrust into the dating game, Matt and Janet find themselves getting increasingly attracted to each other, sharing not only their love for sports but also their ambitions, fears, and vulnerabilities. As they grow closer, an article unmasking Matt's secret romance goes viral, jeopardizing Janet's reputation, making others believe she used him for her personal gains. Janet, devastated by the accusations, is determined to clear her name, while Matt tries his best to support her and prove the genuineness of their love. They work together to outwit their detractors and discover the real mastermind who leaked their story.

Plot title: The Prophecy Movie plot: Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo.

Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine. After finding Uziel's burnt body, all evidence of its oddity now lost, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon.

He eventually finds the lamp; he pauses to pick flowers from a tree for his mother, which instantly turn into jewels, so he takes a whole sack full. Aladdin makes it back to Hassim, but fears that he may be killed after Hassim takes the lamp away from him, and so he refuses to give it to him. Enraged, Hassim uses his powers to close the entrance of the cave forever, trapping Aladdin. Aladdin kneels to pray and accidentally rubs the lamp, releasing a powerful genie inside, who can grant any wish. Aladdin wishes that he was out of the cave and back home. Aladdin tries showing his mother the magic lamp, but she fears it is too dangerous and wants him to put the lamp away and remain silent about it. Cut to four years later, Aladdin and his mother must hide indoors for the sultan and his daughter Layla are being escorted to the bathing house and the sultan orders that no one looks upon his daughter, or the punishment is death. Curious by the sultan's order, Aladdin sneaks out while his mother sleeps. He sneaks into the bathing house and sees Layla from inside, and is... My question: Why did Hassim close the cave? A:","completion":"Hassim closed the cave because Aladdin refused to give him the lamp, which was the treasure Hassim wanted. Enraged by Aladdin's defiance and fearing the potential consequences, Hassim used his powers to close the entrance of the cave forever, trapping Aladdin inside. This served both as a punishment for Aladdin and a way to ensure that the powerful lamp wouldn't fall into someone else's hands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.

Given the question: Question: \\"Where will you find Neptune's warmest temperatures?\\" Context: \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Deeper inside the layers of gas in Neptune, the temperature rises steadily.

Your preferred way to relieve the overheating problem is through non-abrasive eatiness practices. 3). , can also cause silica discoloration. For instance, a household with steam doors may be able to reduce the tolerance between the smoke and evaporation potential which allows the silica molecules to neutralize particles and products that used to be over-vented through ventilation. 4). These particles are acidic enough to cause silica that it drips from the wall. These effects cause a store of silica in changing materials, as silica cannot be refined.","completion":"1).

Explanation: The other answers don't make much sense. We're talking about reducing silica exposure, which is a risk in industries that work with concrete, glass, or similar materials. Answer 1 talks about finding alternatives for those materials, which helps reduce the risk. The other answers don't really explain how to reduce silica exposure and are a bit confusing.

In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Gettin' Hungry\\". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love. On September 18, 1967, Smiley Smile was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the Billboard charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno.

Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near.

Two coats, completely opaque and streak free.

Dr Joanne Rudling, 46, of Cardiff, and Dr Lindsey Thomas, 42, of Tredegar, deny manslaughter by gross negligence. Cardiff Crown Court heard Dr Rudling admitted failing to note down a phone call with his mother before he died. Ryan first fell ill in July 2012 and weighed just 4st 11lb (30kg) at the time of his death, in December of that year. Prosecutors allege that, after Ryan's mother, Carol, made several appointments at Abernant Surgery in Abertillery, the accused doctors failed to properly diagnose his condition.

First question: What is the best evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt that the Holocaust occurred? Second question: What did Americans know about the Holocaust as it was occurring? Are these two questions asking the same thing? pick from the following. (a). no (b). yes","completion":"To answer your first question, I will gather key evidence that proves beyond reasonable doubt that the Holocaust occurred: 1. Documentation: The Nazis meticulously kept records of their activities, including the extermination of millions of Jews and other minorities. Thousands of documents have been found and analyzed, providing direct evidence of the Holocaust. 2. Eyewitness testimonies: Holocaust survivors and liberated prisoners from concentration camps provide firsthand accounts of the atrocities committed. Additionally, testimonies from Nazi officials, soldiers, and citizens who witnessed the events provide further insight into the Holocaust. 3. Photographs and personal belongings: Photographs taken during the Holocaust, including images of concentration camps, mass killings, and deportations, serve as visual evidence. Personal belongings, such as clothes and shoes left behind by the victims, also add to the proof. 4. Concentration camps and mass graves: The existence and tourable remains of concentration and extermination camps, such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Sobibor, show where millions were killed. Mass graves discovered across Europe also provide evidence of mass killings. 5. Trials and confessions: The post-war Nuremberg Trials and subsequent trials of Nazi officials documented confessions and demonstrated the scale and organization of the Holocaust. Now, for your second question, what Americans knew about the Holocaust as it was occurring: 1. News reports: Throughout World War II, American newspapers and radio broadcasts reported on the persecution and mass killings of Jews in Europe. 2. Government knowledge: American government officials received intelligence reports from their European allies, agencies, and eyewitnesses that confirmed the ongoing genocide. 3. Jewish advocacy groups: American Jewish organizations raised awareness and appealed to the U.S. government for intervention and help for Jewish refugees. 4. Limited knowledge of the full extent: Although the U.S. public knew about the persecution of Jews, information was scattered and often censored, so the full extent of the Holocaust was not well understood during the war. Now, to determine whether the two questions are asking the same thing: The first question asks about the best evidence proving that the Holocaust occurred, while the second question asks what Americans knew about it while it was happening. These questions are related but distinct. Therefore, the correct answer is: (a). no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \\"Camera - rolling!\\" and another follows with \\"Group 36 Training Film.\\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \\"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually...

However, there is a slight difference in the sentence structure and use of conjunctions in both sentences which can be further analyzed. Sentence 1: \\"The smaller one of the two boats carries up to 24 cars, the larger 18 cars.\\" In this sentence, the author specifies two boats and highlights that one is smaller and the other is larger. The sentence structure seems a bit incomplete and less clear due to the omission of words that could help make a connection between the clauses. The author mentions the smaller boat can carry up to 24 cars but does not explicitly state that the larger boat carries 18 cars. Instead, the number 18 is mentioned directly after \\"the larger,\\" which could potentially create a slight misinterpretation. Sentence 2: \\"The smaller of the two boats carries up to 24 cars, whilst the larger one carries 18 cars.\\" In this sentence, the author again specifies two boats, one smaller and the other larger. However, the use of the conjunction \\"whilst\\" provides a clearer connection between the clauses in this sentence. This sentence explicitly states that the smaller boat can carry up to 24 cars, and the larger one carries 18 cars. Both sentences deliver the same message, and understanding one would lead to understanding the other. It's just that the second sentence has a clearer structure and better use of conjunctions which provide a more precise and unambiguous communication of the capacities of the two boats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'? The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on \\"the islands that are called Hirtir\\". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century John of Fordun referred to it as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when Donald Munro suggested that: \\"The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther.\\"Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to Druidism as it did to Christianity until the arrival of Rev. John MacDonald in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on Boreray.Coll MacDonald of Colonsay raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a \\"company\\" of up to 60 persons to which he \\"elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength.\\" A:","completion":"The present-day name of the place John Fordun referred to as 'the isle of Irte (insula de Irte), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world' is St Kilda. This can be inferred from the article's mention of St Kilda's first written record dating from 1202, and its discussion of the islands being historically part of the domain of the MacLeods of Harris. The association of St Kilda with the name 'isle of Irte' mentioned by John of Fordun further supports this conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Historians seeking to identify a troop of fallen World War One soldiers could be one step closer to cracking the 99 year mystery after tracing the descendant of a young man killed in France in 1914. The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20. It is believed Private Frederick could be one of the 15 found at the site in France in 2009. Now, his great-nephew Eric Saunders, 61,. from Worcester, has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it matches with. one of the sets of remains and proves it belongs to his relative. Eric Saunders has submitted a DNA sample in the hope it will confirm one of the sets of remains of soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, belongs to his great uncle. Private Frederick Thompson (left and right, with his wife) was reported missing in 1914 at the age of 20. Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, in 2009. And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on. The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death. Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009. One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains. The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified. Mr Saunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War. I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country. 'I was stunned to discover that he had been killed at the age of just 20. 'I have grandchildren that age myself, and I can’t even begin to imagine what those soldier’s poor mothers went through. 'I know it happened to a lot of people but it really hits home to find out that happened to one of my own relatives. 'I didn’t really know anything about my mother’s side of the family. We were both shocked. The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year. Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011. Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time. The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields. The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium. In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving. The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial. The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place. 'I was very keen to give a DNA sample to try and prove the identity of these unknown heroes. 'I’ve. been told it may take several months to come back with a result, but I. hope I can do my bit to give those men the proper funeral they deserve. 'I’ve said that I would like to attend the funeral ceremony for the men, even if it turns out not to be my uncle’s remains. I feel as though I have a bond with those men now.' The 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment had been based in Ireland at the outbreak of the war, landing in France on September 9, 1914, and taking part in the Battle of Armentihres. The battalion then headed to fight with the 6th Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31. All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014. An MOD spokesman said: 'The use of DNA can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered, but after many decades results may be inconclusive. We always take steps to make families fully aware of this possibility. 'DNA testing is only used where there is a realistic chance of a positive match being obtained and may not be appropriate in all cases. 'The JCCC Historic Casework team undertakes a unique and essential role in investigating where remains of British Service Personnel are found on wartime battlefields and is always mindful that their work often closes a chapter for families who have lost loved ones many years ago.' Historic find: Beaucamps-Ligny is situated to the west of Lille in France.","completion":"Historians are on the brink of potentially identifying a troop of fallen World War One soldiers, thanks to the discovery of possible DNA connections provided by the great-nephew of a young man killed in the war.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the most effective ways to prevent SARS is thorough and frequent hand-washing. This minimizes the spread of the virus from surfaces that many—or infected-- people touch. Use a mild soap and hot water and wash your hands in warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use a hand sanitizer of at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Make sure to wash your hands even after you’ve taken off disposable gloves. If there is a chance that you may come into contact with someone who has SARS, or their body fluids or feces, wear disposable gloves. This can help ensure that you don’t accidentally infect yourself. You can use surgical-type gloves to prevent contamination. Make sure to check for any rips or punctures before you put on the gloves. Dispose of the gloves after each use in a lined wastebasket. Never wash or reuse gloves. You can get disposable gloves at many pharmacies and most medical supply stores. Typically, a person with SARS will be hospitalized and isolated, with no visitors allowed except for the few hospital staff caring for them. If you are in the same room as a person with SARS, wear a surgical mask. This can help minimize your risk of inhaling the virus. There is some evidence that in addition to wearing a surgical mask, wearing glasses may also a certain amount of protection against SARS. You may want to purchase an N95 particulate respirator as your surgical mask. Although there is varying information on the type of surgical mask with which you can protect yourself from respiratory viruses, the N95 is specifically designed to protect against large droplets and smaller respiratory particles. Put the mask in front of your mouth and nose. Secure the mask to your face with the pointer finger and thumb of your dominant hand. Push the mask on to your face until you are sure there is no space between your face and the mask. Pull the garter than ensures your mask will stay on your face. This should be found on the top of the mask. Stretch the garter over your head and secure it on the back of your head. You can purchase surgical masks at many pharmacies and most medical supply stores. It’s vital to wash any personal items shared with SARS patients. From utensils to bedding and clothing, making sure these items are properly washed can help minimize the risk of contracting the disease. You should not share clothing, towels, or bedding with a SARS patient. However, wash any laundry in a washing machine with warm or hot water and detergent. You can also consider adding some bleach to the load. Make sure to wear gloves when handling any soiled garments. You should not share eating utensils with an infected person, but you also don’t need to separate utensils for use by the patient. You can wash any dishes and eating utensils the infected person has used in a dishwasher or by hand with soap and hot water. It may help to separate infected waste into a separate bag or container from your wastebasket. You can then close the bag with the infected waste and place it in your regular wastebasket. This measure can help ensure that animals, small children, or other people don’t accidentally come in contact with infected waste. The SARS virus spreads easily in places such as bathrooms or on kitchen surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting these spaces frequently may help prevent spreading the virus. Any surface touched by an infected person—such as the toilet or bathroom sink—should be cleaned and disinfected as often as possible, even after each use if possible. You can use anti-septic or anti-bacterial cleansers or a bleach mixture to disinfect surfaces. Make sure to wear gloves when you clean and throw them away after use. If a person in your home is infected with SARS, they will require isolation for at least 10 days. During this period, limit the number of people in your home as much as possible. This can minimize the risk of any family getting the virus or transmitting to the outside world. Patients should only leave the home for routine medical treatment. You may also want to separate the person from family members as much as possible. You can ask friends or family members to host for any person who has no symptoms of SARS if possible.","completion":"The article discusses effective ways to prevent the spread of SARS, including frequent hand-washing, wearing disposable gloves and surgical masks, isolating infected individuals, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting shared spaces."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Denver scored first on a Javon Walker 54-yard pass from Jay Cutler in the 3rd minute of the first quarter. They scored again in the 6th minute of the first quarter on a 30-yard field goal compliments of Jason Elam. Elam tacked on another 3 in the second minute of the second quarter from 22 yards. The Cardinals got on the board in the 6th minute of the second quarter with a field goal from Neil Rackers. They scored again in the 7th minute on a fumble return for a touchdown by Antonio Smith for 4 yards after Tatum Bell lost the ball. Elam struck again from 30 yards in the 14th minute of the 2nd quarter. Denver went on to score 3 more TDs. One in the third on a 10-yard pass to Rod Smith and two more in the fourth both on 1-yard carries from Mike Bell. Arizona scored on an FG in the third from 38 yards compliments of Rackers and then on a touchdown in the fourth on a four-yard carry by Edgerrin James. The Broncos improved to 8-6 while the Cardinals fell to 4-10. Play-off Implications: Jay Cutler replacing Jake Plummer for his third regular season start had an impressive game with 21 completions on 31 attempts for 261 yards total. He had two TD passes and 1 interception. The run game while not impressive by Broncos' standards (106 yards team total with Mike Bell leading Tatum Bell (28 yards), with 61 yards on 16 carries) did provide enough of a threat to allow Cutler opportunities to make plays. After the Broncos' relatively stagnant last four games any semblance of an offensive rhythm is encouraging. The win in Arizona kept Bronco play-off hopes alive and set up an exciting must-win situation against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 16. The Broncos can clinch a wild card playoff berth with a win against the Bengals and a loss by the KC Chiefs along with a loss by either the NY Jets or the Jacksonville Jaguars. Question: How many yards per pass completion did Jay Cutler average in this game? Answer:","completion":"Jay Cutler had 21 completions for 261 yards in the game. To find out how many yards per pass completion he averaged, we need to divide the total yards (261) by the number of completions (21). So, 261 yards ÷ 21 completions = 12.42 yards per completion. In simple words, Jay Cutler averaged about 12 yards for each pass he completed during that game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My only complaint is that part of the picture of the puzzle at the bottom right was hidden from view by writing. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","completion":"The product review seems to predominantly convey a positive sentiment towards the product. There are several indicators in the text that point towards this interpretation. Firstly, the title: \\"Great graphics!\\" assumes a highly positive tone. It suggests that the reviewer was impressed by the graphic quality of the product. This can be understood as a significant positive aspect of their experience since the visual quality or graphic work of a product is often one of the main features. Secondly, the reviewer mentions that they had to use a 'team effort' to complete the puzzle with their 3-year-old grandson. This can be seen as a positive trait for the product as it evidently provided an opportunity for cooperative play and bonding. Additionally, even though the reviewer states that the game was a 'little difficult' for their grandson, it didn't come across as a complaint or criticism but rather as a fact or observation. Some might even interpret this as a positive point because it suggests that the product presents a healthy challenge for young minds. Lastly, while the reviewer does express one complaint - that is, part of the picture of the puzzle was obscured by writing, it seems relatively minor when compared to the positive aspects they mentioned. It does add a slight negative tone, but it does not dominate the review, hence the overall tone remains positive. Therefore, while there is a blend of positive and some minor negative sentiment in this review, it leans more towards a positive sentiment about the product. A potential shopper reading this review would likely see it as a recommendation rather than a discouragement from buying the product."},{"prompt":"Given the question: When was the lead designer of the Lockheed Starfighter born?

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Katie (Jenny McCarthy) and Becca (Pamela Anderson) are talking about a tape, which Katie believes is a sex tape, but Becca refers to a cursed tape (The Ring). After several odd occurrences, they both die. Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) and his clumsy brother George (Simon Rex) discover a crop circle, saying \\"Attack Here!\\" (Signs).Meanwhile, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), now a blonde news reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She then goes to pick up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody (Drew Mikuska) from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall) is his teacher. George Logan arrives to pick up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy falls in love with George, who invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle that evening with his rapper friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart) (8 Mile). George competes and proves to be actually quite talented, but due to unintentional racist blunders, he's thrown out.Later, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company, since she watched the cursed videotape. After playing several pranks on Cindy (fake seizures, burning hand, etc.), she gets the rest of the popcorn in the lounge, when the TV turns on. Brenda fails to turn it off. Tabitha (Marny Eng) climbs out of the well and the TV, Brenda gets into a fight with Tabitha. Tabitha ends up killing Brenda, since Cindy is ignoring the ruckus. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie (Denise Richards).During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik, due to a misunderstanding, wreak havoc on Brenda's corpse in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and end up getting kicked out of the house. Later, Cindy decides to watch the tape, finding it odd. She then gets a phone call, saying she'll die in a week. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ offers that his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Aunt Shaneequa (Queen Latifah), the Matrix Oracle, and her husband Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) agree to watch the tape. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse, and gets into a fight with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.Back at work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy tries to warn everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter, but she is interrupted by her boss and a janitor who insults the manager on the teleprompter (which the anchorman blindly recites). The Logans hear the message and take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson (Edward Moss), and President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen), who personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy ventures to the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect (George Carlin). The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistook the evil tape for a copy of Pootie Tang and returned it to Blockbuster instead, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.Returning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy manages to track him back to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight off the extraterrestrials. The aliens (voiced by Tom Kenny) arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, thinking it was Pootie Tang.In the basement, Cindy realizes the farm's cellar is what is seen on the tape and she finds the well where Tabitha was drowned under the cellar floor. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha appears to accept the offer, but then changes back to her monstrous form and advances to Cindy and the others, only to be accidentally knocked back into the well by President Harris. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they forget to take Cody with them. At first, Cody is about to get hit by Cindy's car in an intersection, but she put the brakes this time to prevent it from happening, much to Cody's relief. Unfortunately, causing Cody to be hit by another car passing through the intersection., Question: Who invites Cindy and Brenda to a rap-battle?

The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere. Now, I have a new situation: In the year 1630 during the month of January Captain Cook began his voyage from the port of Calais in Europe, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. His intention was to find the mythical land in the Southern Hemisphere. After about eleven months of sailing, in December 1630, he reached Australia, which is indeed in the Southern Hemisphere. Thinking he finally reached the mythical land, he commenced his return voyage to Europe on June, 1631, He reached Europe in the middle of the following year on July, 1632. Answer this question please: Which place received more direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630, Europe or Australia? A:","completion":"Australia received more direct sunlight when Captain Cook started his voyage to the mythical land in 1630. This is because it was January, which is one of the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere where Australia is located, and during that time, the Southern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight. In contrast, Europe, being in the Northern Hemisphere, experiences colder temperatures and less sunlight in January."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sediment builds up over the remains happens, how will it affect the remains decompose less. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that if more sediment builds up over the remains of animals and plants, the decomposition process might be affected or slowed down. Indeed, this supposition can have both direct and indirect effects on the fossilization process. Direct effects of increased sediment on decomposition: 1. Increased pressure: As more sediment accumulates over the remains, the pressure exerted on them increases. This compaction can help slow the decomposition process by limiting the infiltration of water, oxygen, and microorganisms, all of which contribute to decomposition. 2. Reduced oxygen availability: The increased sediment layers can lead to reduced oxygen availability in the environment surrounding the remains. Aerobic decomposition, which requires oxygen, will be slowed or halted, allowing for the preservation of more organic material from the remains. Indirect effects of increased sediment on decomposition: 1. Change in burial environment: An increased rate of sedimentation may alter the burial environment in which the remains are entombed. For example, if the sediment is rich in minerals that promote mineralization, it could enhance the replacement of the remaining parts with minerals and speed up fossil formation. 2. Influence on microbial activity: The type and amount of sediment could influence the microbial community in the burial environment, which, in turn, affects the decomposition process. Some microbial communities might accelerate the decomposition, while others might slow it down or even promote fossilization. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of increased sediment accumulation over the remains of animals and plants can indeed impact the decomposition process, both directly and indirectly. This change in the process may either accelerate or slow down the fossilization process, depending on various factors, such as pressure, oxygen availability, and the burial environment's microbial activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere). Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity). Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. and the situation: Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters. Answer the following question: Which continent experienced more tornadoes?","completion":"Lemuria experienced more tornadoes, as it is mentioned that Lemuria experienced natural disasters, and tornadoes are considered as a natural disaster.

One was 100,000 years old called village R, and the other one was about 9,000 years old called village N. The older settlement was located in Africa, the other one wasn't. Which village had more people that were hunters? A:","completion":"Based on the limited information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which village, R or N, had more people who were hunters. However, we can still analyze the settlements based on their ages and locations. Village R, the 100,000-year-old settlement in Africa, existed during the Early Stone Age or Paleolithic era, a time when humans primarily survived through hunting and gathering. At that time, hunting was prevalent and significantly contributed to the sustenance of human communities. In contrast, Village N, the 9,000-year-old settlement, likely existed during the Neolithic era. During this period, humans began practicing agriculture and animal domestication, which reduced the reliance on hunting for survival. However, hunting could still have played a role in the lives of these settlers. Since the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture affected human communities at different times and rates depending on the region, it is important to consider the location of Village N. If Village N was located in a region where agriculture developed early (e.g., the Fertile Crescent, parts of China, etc.), a larger proportion of the population might have been farmers rather than hunters. However, if Village N was situated in an area with less agricultural development, hunting may have remained prevalent. In conclusion, given the available data, it is not possible to definitively state which village had more hunters. However, if we compare the eras in which these villages existed, it is more likely that Village R had a higher proportion of hunters, as it was located during the Early Stone Age/Paleolithic era when hunting was a critical component of human survival."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution.

Step 1: Introduce Mo Farah's performance Begin by giving an overview of Mo Farah's performance in his marathon debut. Mention that despite being a decorated athlete in shorter distance events, the marathon proved a different challenge for the British champion. (Paragraph 1) In his highly anticipated marathon debut, British Olympic champion and long-distance runner Mo Farah faced unexpected difficulties. Although renowned for his exceptional achievements in the 5,000m and 10,000m track events, Farah struggled to maintain the same level of dominance in the 42.195km marathon. Despite his relentless spirit, the British athlete secured eighth place, a far cry from his usual podium finishes. Step 2: Highlight Wilson Kipsang's victory Shift focus to Wilson Kipsang's remarkable achievement and provide a brief background on his previous accomplishments. Emphasize his dominant performance and second consecutive win. (Paragraph 2) While Farah's marathon endeavors fell short, Kenyan world record holder Wilson Kipsang showcased incredible prowess on the London course. Kipsang, who currently holds the men's marathon world record with an outstanding time of 2:03:23, continued to solidify his reputation as one of the sport's greats. Winning his second consecutive title in London, Kipsang demonstrated exceptional skill in maintaining a strong pace throughout the race with a winning time of 2:04:29. Step 3: Analyze the factors that may have influenced Farah's performance Delve into potential reasons for Mo Farah's struggles in his marathon debut. Consider the transition from track to road racing, his experience, and the level of competition. (Paragraph 3) Farah's debut marathon performance prompts an examination of the factors that contributed to his less than typical finish. Transitioning from shorter track events to the grueling road race requires a significantly different skill set and mental fortitude. Additionally, Farah faced stiff competition from seasoned marathon competitors, making his debut all the more challenging. The marathon demands extraordinary endurance, pacing strategies, and mental resilience, aspects that differ from the burst of speed and tactics employed on the track. Step 4: Discuss how this result could impact Farah's career and future plans Touch upon what implications Mo Farah's marathon debut might have on his career choices and objectives. (Paragraph 4) Mo Farah's experience in the London Marathon may influence his future plans and goals within the world of long-distance running. While his debut was not as successful as he hoped, it provided valuable insights into the challenges presented by the marathon distance. Farah may choose to continue competing in track events - where he has firmly established himself - or he might double down on his marathon training, eager to prove his capabilities in yet another athletic arena. Conclusion: Recap the article's main points, emphasizing the contrast between Mo Farah's debut and Wilson Kipsang's victory. End on a positive note, indicating that Farah's performance offers up exciting possibilities for the future of his career. In conclusion, British Olympic champion Mo Farah experienced a challenging marathon debut, finishing eighth in the London Marathon. Meanwhile, the Kenyan world record holder Wilson Kipsang continued his dominance, winning his second title in London. Farah's performance may prompt him to reevaluate his approach to long-distance running, ultimately shaping the trajectory of his already illustrious career. Despite the less than ideal debut, Farah's foray into marathon running continues to captivate the world of athletics as fans eagerly await what the future holds for this multifaceted champion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Lost and Delirious Movie plot: When shy and introspective Mary arrives as a new freshman student at an all-girls boarding school, she shares a dorm room with two seniors, Pauline (nicknamed Paulie) and Victoria (nicknamed Tori). In contrast to the timid Mary, Paulie is full of life. For example, at Mary's very first day at the school during a quiet afternoon party on the campus thrown by the staff as a welcome back gathering, Paulie turns the events into a loud music-blasting dance party and spikes the punch with hard liquor. In an effort to break Mary out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the morning. When Mary's roommates learn that her mother recently died, Paulie nicknames her \\"Mary Brave\\". Mary observes the intimacy between her two roommates. Peering out a window at night, she sees them kissing on a roof. At first, she thinks that they are practicing kissing in order to prepare themselves for kissing men, but she soon realises the nature of their romance.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation. Humanitarian assistance has been exempted from the economic sanctions, but Beasely said import restrictions has made it more complicated to bring in aid, and made...

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B. Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B? Hint: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, process B would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. This is because process B is associated with the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla which releases fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline. Adrenaline prepares the body to respond to emergencies and increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man is riding upside down on the side of a horse at a rodeo.\\" if \\"A stunt rider performs tricks at the rodeo.\\"?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclusively state that \\"A man is riding upside down on the side of a horse at a rodeo\\" based solely on the information that \\"A stunt rider performs tricks at the rodeo.\\" There are several reasons for this: 1. Lack of specificity: The statement \\"A stunt rider performs tricks at the rodeo\\" is quite vague and does not provide any details about the specific type of tricks being performed. Stunt riders can perform numerous types of tricks, such as bareback riding, Roman riding, vaulting, and trick roping, to name a few. Without any further information, it is impossible to definitively conclude that a man is riding upside down on the side of a horse. 2. Variety of tricks and stunts: There are numerous different stunts and tricks a rider could perform at a rodeo, and not all of them involve riding a horse upside down on its side. While this trick may be considered impressive and dangerous, it is only one example of the many possibilities for a stunt rider's performance. Thus, without any explicit mention of the specific stunt being performed, one cannot simply assume that it involves riding upside down on the side of a horse. 3. Different events within a rodeo: A rodeo typically consists of several events, and not all events involve horse riding stunts. For instance, there can be bull riding, barrel racing, and steer wrestling. Even though the statement mentions the involvement of a stunt rider, it doesn't specify whether the stunt rider is performing in a horse-riding event or any other event within the rodeo. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that the man is riding upside down on the side of a horse. 4. Physical feasibility: Riding upside down on the side of a horse can be difficult to imagine and execute. It requires exceptional balance, strength, and skill from the rider. While it may be possible for talented stunt riders to perform such a stunt, it is important to remember that this would be a feat of extraordinary proportions and should not be assumed based only on the general statement provided. In conclusion, there is not enough information in the statement \\"A stunt rider performs tricks at the rodeo\\" to conclusively determine whether or not a man is riding upside down on the side of a horse. Alternative tricks and stunts, different events within a rodeo, lack of specificity, and the physical feasibility of the stunt all contribute to the uncertainty surrounding the precise performance of the stunt rider in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His legend is recorded in a late 15th-century Swiss illustrated chronicle. It is set in the time of the original foundation of the Old Swiss Confederacy in the early 14th century. According to the legend, Tellan expert marksman with the crossbowassassinated Gessler, a tyrannical reeve of Habsburg Austria positioned in Altdorf, Uri. - A codex (from the Latin \\"caudex\\" for \\"trunk of a tree\\" or \\"block of wood\\", \\"book\\"; plural \\"codices\\") is a book constructed of a number of sheets of paper, vellum, papyrus, or similar materials, with hand-written contents. The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge, and using a cover thicker than the sheets. Some codices are continuously folded like a concertina. The alternative to paged codex format for a long document is the continuous scroll. Examples of folded codices include the Maya codices. Sometimes people use the term for a book-style format, including modern printed books but excluding folded books. - A crossbow, also known as horizontal bow, is a type of weapon based on the bow and consisting of a horizontal bow-like assembly mounted on a stock. It shoots projectiles called bolts or quarrels. The medieval crossbow was called by many names, most of which were derived from the word ballista, a torsion siege engine resembling a crossbow. - A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) is any document written by hand or typewritten, as opposed to being mechanically printed or reproduced in some automated way. More recently, it is understood to be an author's written, typed, or word-processed copy of a work, as distinguished from the print of the same. Before the arrival of printing, all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations. Manuscripts may be in book form, scrolls or in codex format. Illuminated manuscripts are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations. - The White Book of Sarnen ( German : Weisses Buch von Sarnen ) is a collection of medieval manuscripts compiled in the late 15th century by Hans Schriber in the canton of Obwalden .

The question asks what will happen to Robin. The options present three possible outcomes for Robin. Option A, \\"want to thank them for being a good friend,\\" implies that Robin appreciates Bailey's friendship. This can be a plausible outcome as they became good friends. Option B, \\"want to be thanked for being a good friend,\\" implies that Robin expects gratitude from Bailey for their friendship. This outcome seems less likely, as it is not mentioned how Robin believes the friendship is one-sided. Option C, \\"be invited by them to hang out more often,\\" implies that Bailey would like to continue spending time with Robin, which is also a plausible outcome since they became good friends. Based on the context given, Robin's appreciation for the friendship could result in wanting to thank Bailey for being a good friend. However, becoming good friends also implies that Bailey values the friendship and would likely want to spend more time with Robin.

We have: 190664 * v - 494 = 190651 * v First, let's see what happens if we subtract 190651 * v from both sides of the equation: 190664 * v - 190651 * v - 494 = 190651 * v - 190651 * v Now, when we subtract the same thing from both sides, it cancels each other out, so on the right side, we will get 0: 190664 * v - 190651 * v - 494 = 0 Next, let's make things a little simpler. We can factor out the 'v' from the left side: v * (190664 - 190651) - 494 = 0 190664 - 190651 = 13, so now we have: v * 13 - 494 = 0 Now, let's get the v by itself by adding 494 to both sides: v * 13 - 494 + 494 = 0 + 494 v * 13 = 494 Now we will divide by 13 to get the value of 'v': v = 494 / 13 v = 38 So, the answer is v = 38.

The soles of your shoes are much rougher than skates. The rougher surface of shoes causes more friction and slows you down. Heavier objects also have more friction.

What is a robot?Basically ,it is a machine which is designed to do the work of a human being. It is usually controlled by a computer. Once it has been given a set of things to do,it will do the job on its own. Nowadays,Britain has 120 robots at work in industry. This compares badly with other industrial countries. In Japan,there are 4,000 robots in use. In the USA there are 2,000 and in Germany there are 500. According to the report,the government must help people understand how robot technology can be used. Also,people must be educated to know how important this new technology is. The designing of new robots will be very important in the future. The report says that special robot centres should be set up where people who design robots and people who will use them work together. The assembly work of the future will be complex .

Solve -1052 + 2777 = 25*q for q.","completion":"The problem described is a basic algebraic problem. The goal is to solve for the variable q. The initial equation is this: -1052 + 2777 = 25*q So, the first step is to simplify the left side of the equation by adding -1052 to 2777. 2777 - 1052 = 1725 So, the equation is now rewritten as: 1725 = 25*q Now to solve for q, you would need to isolate q. In this case, you need to get rid of the 25 that is currently being multiplied to q. To do this, you'll need to divide both sides of the equation by 25. 1725 / 25 = (25*q) / 25 The 25's on the right side of the equation cancel out: 69 = q In conclusion, the variable q in the equation -1052 + 2777 = 25*q is equal to 69.

Preserved in the fossil's gut were undigested remains of squid tentacles. The findings has provided insight into how these reptiles ate and lived. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: New Ichthyosaur Species Unveiled: Ichthyosaurus anningae A noteworthy discovery took place recently when Palaeontologist Dean Lomax stumbled upon a fossil in storage at Doncaster Museum. Initially presumed to be a plaster cast of an ichthyosaur found on the renowned Jurassic Coast, this 189 million-year-old fossil turned out to be a real specimen and, even more incredibly, represented a species previously unknown to science. The ichthyosaur, now named Ichthyosaurus anningae, is it not just a meaningful addition to the Icthyosauridae family, but provides significant insight into palaeontological history. Lomax's discovery reinforces that even long-established museums can hold cryptic clues to the Earth's remarkable prehistoric past. About five feet in length, this newly discovered ichthyosaur bore a striking resemblance to modern-day dolphins. This feature is yet another reflection of convergent evolution, where unrelated groups of animals evolve similar attributes as a response to comparable environmental pressures. Intriguingly, the fossil of Ichthyosaurus anningae didn't merely disclose its external appearance. The specimen, remarkably well preserved, held within its remains undigested squid tentacles. This provides a rare indication into the ichthyosaurs' dietary habits, suggesting that these animals preyed upon squid, similar to modern-day cetaceans. The recorded presence of squid tentacles in its gut provides vivid evidence of its last meal, shedding light on the ecology of this prehistoric marine life. This deepens our understanding of how these ancient reptiles fed and lived, opening new avenues of research into other ichthyosaurs' paleoecology. Moreover, naming the new species 'Ichthyosaurus anningae' pays tribute to Mary Anning, the pioneering 19th-century fossil collector who initially discovered ichthyosaurs along the Jurassic Coast of southern England. This acknowledgement to her contributions unveils the importance of continuous exploration, drawing parallels between past and present in the realm of scientific discovery. This discovery by Dean Lomax reminds us of the enormous potential that lies within historical collections to advance our understanding of prehistoric life. This also prompts to meticulously reassess and preserve such collections, as they might harbour scientific breakthroughs yet to be realized. Moreover, this new finding not only extends the diversity of ichthyosaurs but also very likely points towards even more unchartered species awaiting discovery. In this light, the story of Ichthyosaurus anningae marks a significant chapter in the book of palaeontology. This engrossing episode serves as a reminder of the thrilling surprises and invaluable scientific lessons that lie buried in the earth's history, merely waiting to be unearthed by an astute eye and an enthused spirit. These 'time capsules' from eons past continue to intrigue, inspire, and inform, sustaining our continuous quest to understand the labyrinth of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson).

The context states that the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C., was built in 1917, which is more than a century ago. To confirm this hypothesis, let's break down the information. 1. The context states that the embassy was built in 1917. 2. The current year is 2021. 3. The number of years that have passed since 1917 is: 2021 - 1917 = 104 years. 4.

They wanted to know if these continents were was connected? If so, how can something so large move so far? What could possibly have enough force to move such a giant slab of rock? Is there other evidence that can provide clues to the past positions of continents? How can answering these questions help us? A scientist named Alfred Wegener had these same questions. Wegener look at rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. He noticed they were the same type and age. He thought that the rocks must have formed side by side. He proposed that the rocks then drifted apart. One part went with North America. The other part stayed with Europe. After reading the above, is \\"Other part of rock\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What stayed in europe\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, \\"the other part of the rock\\" would be the correct answer to the question \\"What stayed in Europe?\\" This statement comes from the observations that Alfred Wegener made as he studied the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Wegener found that the rocks of the same type and age in North America and Europe seemed to have formed side by side and then drifted apart. Consequently, one part of the rock went with North America while the other part stayed in Europe. His observations led him to propose the idea of continental drift, suggesting that continents were once connected and have since moved apart over time. These ideas laid the foundation for the theory of plate tectonics, which describes the movement of Earth's lithosphere (the rigid outer layer of the Earth) as a result of internal forces within the planet. The lithosphere is divided into several large and small moving plates, and their interactions help to explain the formation and movement of continents, the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and other geological events. The concept of continental drift and plate tectonics has allowed scientists to better understand Earth's past and ongoing geological processes. Moreover, it provides crucial insights into the distribution of resources, such as oil and natural gas, and the potential occurrence of natural disasters like earthquakes. By studying the patterns and mechanisms behind the movement of Earth's plates, scientists can better predict geological activity and assess the associated risks, ultimately contributing to the well-being and safety of societies worldwide."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Several thousand years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by a civil war by the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron.

This sentence is suggesting that King Henry did not have a son who could inherit his throne, or succeed him, when he died or was no longer able to rule. As per the feudal system, the crown would typically be passed on to the ruling king's male heir, usually a son. But in cases where the king did not have a male heir, or if any potential heirs were deemed unfit to rule for whatever reason, a successor would be chosen to ensure continued leadership. In this case, King Henry does not have a son to carry forward his rule. As a result, Beowulf is chosen to receive the crown after King Henry, either because of his qualities as a leader or due to his lineage, or perhaps a combination of both. It's interesting to note though, that this sentence seems to combine characters or figures from different historical or mythological periods and geographies.

If you can have it delivered to work, there's nothing more to do.;","completion":"If you can have it delivered to work, there's nothing more to do; however, if that's not an option, consider other methods to ensure your package's safety. For instance, you could invest in a package locker or delivery service that can securely store your deliveries until you're available to retrieve them. In addition, you may want to request a signature upon delivery so that the package won't be left outside unattended. Taking the time to set up notifications or tracking for your deliveries is another effective method to closely monitor the status of your packages, and thereby, plan your schedule accordingly to be present for the delivery. In some cases, shipping companies may allow you to customize your delivery preferences, enabling you to request a specific delivery window or ask the driver to leave the package in a discreet location. Communicating with neighbors and setting up a community watch system can further deter potential thieves, as concerned neighbors can look out for each other's packages. Overall, a combination of these strategies can significantly reduce the risk of package theft and ensure that your personal belongings reach you safely and securely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: What reenactment influenced scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October?","completion":"Title: How Reenactments Influenced Sergey Eisenstein's Film \\"October: Ten Days that Shook the World\\" Introduction: Film has the power to redefine and retell historical events, and few directors took this as much to heart as the Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein. One of his most acclaimed films, \\"October: Ten Days that Shook the World,\\" is an intertwining of cinema and history that shifted the patterns of filmmaking. One significant aspect of Eisenstein's \\"October\\" is its use of reenactments, particularly the reenactment of the October Revolution, as key narrative tools. The October Revolution Reenactment Influence: Perhaps the most substantial influence on the film \\"October\\" was the mass reenactment of the October Revolution held in 1920. This event, organized by the Soviet state on the Revolution's third anniversary, sought to publicly display and celebrate the Bolshevik victory. Eisenstein used footages from this reenactment directly in his film, finding in them a way to lend authenticity, immediacy, and a sense of collective involvement to his narrative. The reenactment's scenes not only provided valuable replicas of the historical past, but the public participation in their staging emphasized the community spirit and collective identification that bolstered the revolutionary moment. These elements come front and center in Eisenstein's film, serving to reinforce his political message and artistic vision. The Use of Revolutionary Iconography: Yet, the influence of the October Revolution reenactment goes deeper than just its footages. The ceremony offered Eisenstein potent iconography that he subsequently transposed into filmic images. It provided him with ready-made visuals of revolutionary upheaval and popular involvement. The attributes like slogans, banners, festoons, and music, which were integral to the reenactment, penetrated the film with a sense of the Revolution's actuality and energetic ambience. Montage Techniques and Dramatization: Eisenstein's use of montage techniques and dramatization were also inspired by the reenactment. The monumental scenes reenacted, such as the Storming of the Winter Palace, were broken down into smaller, manageable events that could be depicted effectively and dramatically in the film. Eisenstein used montage to structure these scenes, shrinking or expanding time and juxtaposing images to generate meaning. This approach, inspired by reenactment, enabled him to control the pacing, focus, and emotional impact of the narrative. Conclusion: One cannot ignore the significant influence the October Revolution reenactment had on Eisenstein's \\"October\\". Serving as both direct visual material and a source of stylistic and narrative inspiration, the reenactment shaped the film's representation of history. Eisenstein's innovative use of reenactment footage and the manner in which he transformed the mass spectacle into a cinematic narrative, marked a new approach to filming history, demarcating him as one of the pioneers of early Soviet cinema. Ultimately, the reenactment's influence on \\"October\\" exemplifies the ways in which real-life events can be harnessed and reimagined in the world of film. The roles of Eisenstein and the grand reenactment of the October Revolution are intertwined, casting a profound effect on the aesthetics and politics of cinema, mirroring the groundbreaking impact of the Revolution itself on Russian politics and world history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet. The Air Force has since apologized and deleted the tweet, saying it was sent in \\"poor taste.\\" The USFOR-A tweet remains. In a statement to VOA, a Pentagon spokesperson said the tweets do not represent a new social media strategy. \\"As with any other organization, the post was an attempt to bring awareness to a major/ongoing organizational activity by tying it to references or conversations already trending with their established audiences,\\" said Lieutenant Colonel Kone Faulkner.

Danny made drastic healthier lifestyle choices, while Bill moved on and continued with his fast-food died , tanning saloons and smoking tobacco. Which person didn't start avoiding carcinogens? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bill is the person who didn't start avoiding carcinogens. Unlike Danny, who made drastic healthier lifestyle choices after reading about how lifestyle choices can influence the risk of getting cancer, Bill continued with his unhealthy habits, which expose him to carcinogens. It is essential to understand that carcinogens are substances or factors that can cause or promote the development of cancer by damaging the DNA or causing abnormal cell growth. Many lifestyle choices increase our exposure to carcinogens and correlating risks. In Bill's case, his continued indulgence in fast food, tobacco smoking, and tanning salons contribute significantly to his higher cancer risk. Fast food is often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, salt, and additives, which can contribute to obesity, inflammation, and insulin resistance, all of which are risk factors for several types of cancer. Furthermore, some fast-food cooking methods, such as deep-frying, can produce harmful chemicals that may have carcinogenic properties. Tobacco smoking is well known for its many hazardous effects on health, with numerous carcinogenic chemicals present in tobacco smoke. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking accounts for about 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Additionally, smoking is a major cause of lung cancer and has strong links to cancers of the oral cavity, throat, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, kidney, cervix, and more. Tanning salons expose individuals to artificial ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is a known carcinogen. The risk of developing skin cancers, including malignant melanoma (the most dangerous form of skin cancer), increases with the use of tanning beds and sunlamps. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified UV-emitting tanning devices as \\"carcinogenic to humans.\\" Danny, on the other hand, reduced his exposure to carcinogens by adopting a healthier lifestyle. This likely included eating a balanced and nutritious diet, rich in fruits and vegetables that provide cancer-fighting antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. He probably also refrained from smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, as well as avoided prolonged exposure to the sun or artificial UV radiation, and engaged in regular physical activity - all of which aid in reducing cancer risk. In conclusion, Bill failed to make necessary changes in his lifestyle to avoid carcinogens, whereas Danny made conscious efforts to minimize his exposure to cancer-causing factors. Consequently, Bill is at a higher risk of developing cancer due to his continued unhealthy habits and ignorance of the dangerous consequences associated with such lifestyle choices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable.

Other children bring food from home such as cold rice balls, meat or fish, and vegetables. The United States A common menu from a US school is made up of a hamburger with fried potatoes or roast chicken, fruit and cookies. School lunches must also provide food with protein ,vitamin A, vitamin C, ironand calories. Australia Meat piesand hotdogs are all traditional dishes in Australian school shops. But as the nation pays more attention to children's health, healthier foods have started to find their way onto school menus. Many schools have used a traffic light system. The sale of red-labeled foods includingchocolate and soft drinks, is served only twice a week. Healthier green-labeled foods such as sandwiches, corn and watermelon, however are served every day.

Answer based on context: Those who landed at Skagway made their way over the White Pass before cutting across to Bennett Lake. Although the trail began gently, it progressed over several mountains with paths as narrow as 2 feet and in wider parts covered with boulders and sharp rocks. Under these conditions horses died in huge numbers, giving the route the informal name of Dead Horse Trail. The volumes of travellers and the wet weather made the trail impassable and, by late 1897, it was closed until further notice, leaving around 5,000 stranded in Skagway. An alternative toll road suitable for wagons was eventually constructed and this, combined with colder weather that froze the muddy ground, allowed the White Pass to reopen, and prospectors began to make their way into Canada. Moving supplies and equipment over the pass had to be done in stages. Most divided their belongings into 65 pounds packages that could be carried on a man's back, or heavier loads that could be pulled by hand on a sled. Ferrying packages forwards and walking back for more, a prospector would need about thirty round trips, a distance of at least 2,500 miles , before they had moved all of their supplies to the end of the trail. Even using a heavy sled, a strong man would be covering 1,000 miles and need around 90 days to reach Lake Bennett.

Understanding the context: Carson has spent twenty-five dollars on a carnival game and finally hit the ball. This suggests that he might have been trying for some time and eventually achieved his goal. 2. Analyzing the question: The question asks what Carson will likely want to do next, which means we need to predict his response to his success based on the given context and common-sense knowledge of social situations. 3. Evaluating the options: (A) pay to play again - Since Carson has already achieved his goal, it's less likely that he would want to pay and try again. (B) tell all his friends - This option seems plausible as people often share their accomplishments with friends, especially if they put a lot of effort or money into it. (C) go on a ride - Given that this is a carnival setting, it's reasonable to assume there might be rides and other attractions. Since Carson seems to have spent a significant amount on the game already and has achieved his goal, he might want to enjoy other aspects of the carnival. 4.

WSJ's Jake Lee and Peter Stein discuss. SINGAPORE—Asian shares succumbed to heavy selling Friday, while the euro and other risk-sensitive currencies were knocked hard, amid intensifying worries European debt problems and U.S. economic woes could tip the global economy into a double-dip recession. Underscoring the global gloom, Australia's central bank cut its forecast for economic growth in 2011 although it noted that inflation—a perennial policy headache in much of Asia—would remain a persistent worry for some years. \\"The past week's market downdraft has been associated, above all, with growing evidence that the second quarter global 'soft patch' is not giving way to a third quarter rebound as quickly as might have been hoped,\\" Barclays Capital said in a note to clients. It said the U.S. jobs report later in the global day will be a key focus. \\"It's not about fundamentals right now, it's about preservation of capital with concerns about liquidity in general,\\" said Sue Trinh, a currency strategist with RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. Regional stock markets were hammered after steep losses on Wall Street Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 512.76 point or 4.31%, marking the biggest single-day point loss since Dec. 1, 2008. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 3.8%, after hitting its lowest level since March 18, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 4.3%, after touching a two-year low. South Korea's Kospi Composite fell 3.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 4.8%, after tapping an 11-month low earlier, India's Sensex declined 2.4%, while the Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.9%. The U.S. dollar and Swiss franc—considered safe-havens in times of upheaval—were sought out by investors taking cover from the meltdown in markets. The euro managed to retrace some of the losses after being knocked back harshly earlier Friday. The Australian dollar, a regional barometer for risk, was down at US1.0472, from above US1.1000 three days earlier. The euro was at ¥110.91 against the yen, from ¥111.27 in New York trade and 1.4102 against the greenback from 1.4100, after falling below 1.4100 for the first time since July 18. The yen rose against the U.S. dollar amid the heightened risk-aversion, partially knocking back Japanese authorities' yen-selling intervention efforts Thursday. The dollar was at ¥78.90, after rising above ¥79.40 in the first few hours of Thursday's intervention. Lead September Japanese government bond futures were up 0.18 at 142.39, on Thursday's Bank of Japan's additional easing steps and safe-haven buying on the back of sharp gains in U.S. Treasurys. In Sydney, the Reserve Bank of Australia revised down its gross domestic product growth forecast for 2011 to 3.25% from 4.25% in May, and cited \\"acute\\" stress in global markets as one of the factors working against rate increases. Cyclicals and growth-sensitive stocks were heavily sold amid the global worries; in Sydney, BHP Billiton lost 4.9% and retailer David Jones was down 7.1%, and exporters took a beating in Tokyo, with Sony off 4.9% to a two-year low and Toyota Motor fell 3.8%, while Samsung Electronics dropped 3.4% in Seoul. Oil prices continued to falter after diving more than 5% Thursday to their lowest level in six months on global demand concerns; September Nymex crude oil futures were recently 82 cents off at 85.81. Spot gold nudged higher after falling sharply Thursday in line with the selloff in commodities. The yellow metal was fetching 1,653.90 per troy ounce, up 5.10 from New York trade. ||||| * Japan's Nikkei down 3.6 pct after heavy US, European losses * US Treasury futures near highest since Dec 2008 * Gold remains soft as investors sell to cover losses * Japan sells record Y4 trln in FX intervention-Nikkei (Adds quotes, updates prices) By Kevin Plumberg SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - - Asian stocks tumbled as much as 5 percent on Friday after panic triggered the worst sell-off on Wall Street since the global financial crisis, prompting investors to slash positions and scramble for cash and government bonds. Fears that the U.S. economy is sliding back toward recession and a recent jumpe in Italian and Spanish bond yields towards danger levels have driven investors to seek cover. U.S. stock futures SPc1 were slightly higher after major U.S. markets fell by 4-5 percent overnight, but employment figures due later in the day could trigger further selling if the jobs picture disappoints. Complicating matters was that Japan and Switzerland have intervened this week to weaken their currencies, which were considered the safest in the developed world. That has caused some safety-seeking investors to think twice about stashing money there when financial market volatility is spiking. So far, retail investors were participating in the heavy selling but institutional equity investors in Asia were not completely liquidating their positions, instead continuing to cut riskier bets and protect their portfolios. \\"What you're seeing is a shakeout of all the money that was put to work in the hope that 2011 turns out like last year, where you saw a nice bounce around the same time,\\" said a Hong Kong-based multi-strategy hedge fund manager. \\"That could still happen but with the losses that people have already taken this year, looks like no wants to take the risk. It's about preserving capital now.\\" Japan's Nikkei share average fell 3.4 percent to the lowest since the week following the country's massive earthquake and tsunami in March. The benchmark MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan was down 3.8 percent , with investors selling across the sectors, whether they are defensive or cyclical. The index is on course for the biggest weekly drop since May 2010, when the European debt crisis was flaring up. \\"Clearly, it's just a knee-jerk reaction to what's going on,\\" said Michael Heffernan, senior client advisor with Austock Group in Australia. \\"We're going down simply on the fear that Italy can't pay its debts.\\" Within Asia, markets with high trade exposure to the West and reliance on commodities looked particularly vulnerable. Taiwan, where the technology sector makes up about half of the equity market capitalisation and depends heavily on exports to developed countries, is a weak point in Asia. The benchmark stock index in Taiwan led Asia, falling 5 percent . Europe, where overloaded national balance sheets have bedeviled politicians struggling to grasp the implications, is currently in the eye of the storm. Italian and Spanish bond yields have kept rising and German bond yields falling, widening spreads the most since the euro was born and causing deep-seated fears about what else policymakers can do to keep the euro zone together. The European Central Bank resumed buying government bonds after a four-month break and announced new longer-term funding for liquidity-starved banks, investors kept selling peripheral European bonds. Traders went warily back to the yen. The dollar was down 0.4 percent to 78.83 yen , a day after Japan reportedly spent a record 4 trillion yen (50.6 billion) to weaken its currency and bolster its export competitiveness. U.S. 10-year Treasury futures ticked up 6/32 to 128-6/32 TYc1, just below the Thursday high of 128-12/32, which was the highest since December 2008. The cash yield was at 2.42 percent , a basis point higher than late New York on Thursday when the 10-year yield hit the lowest since October 2010. The yield has sank 37 basis points so far in August, as a wall of worry sends investors to the most liquid bond market in the world. Commodity markets extended heavy overnight losses on fears of slowing demand. U.S. crude for September delivery CLc1 fell 1 percent to 85.75 a barrel after plunging as much as 6 percent on Thursday and closing at the lowest since February 2011. In an ominous sign, gold prices were soft despite the spiralling fears hurting risky markets. Investors were having to sell gold positions to cover losses elsewhere in their portfolios. Spot gold prices eased 3.71 an ounce to 1,644.19 after hitting a record around 1,681 an ounce on Thursday before losing some of the gains. \\"This will not be a quiet day.

This might cause the world's economy to slow down even more. When people are worried, they don't want to risk as much, so they buy safer things with their money like U.S. dollars or the Swiss Franc. This makes it harder for companies to make money, and the value of their stocks goes down. Many countries in Asia, such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea, saw their stock prices fall a lot.

Immigrants \\"will have to come forward and pass a rigorous background check,\\" he said in making the case to conservatives. \\"If they’re criminals they won’t qualify. If they pass, they will be given an opportunity to pay an application fee and a fine and be given a guest worker permit allowing them to stay in the US, work, travel, and pay taxes.” Rubio contends the status quo is \\"horrible for America,\\" and says the Gang of Eight's plan \\"is not a special path\\" and in fact enforces \\"consequences\\" for violators. Elsewhere in Rubioland: On Jay-Z's Cuba trip: \\"Jay-Z needs to get informed. One of his heroes is Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a racist that wrote extensively about the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent, so he should inform himself on the guy that he’s propping up.\\" And furthermore: \\"If Jay-Z was truly interested in the true state of affairs in Cuba, he would have met people that are being oppressed, including a hip-hop artist in Cuba who is right now being oppressed and persecuted and is undergoing a hunger strike because of his political lyrics. And I think he missed an opportunity. But that’s Jay-Z’s issue.\\" On North Korea: “What North Korea has is not a government. What North Korea has is a criminal syndicate.” Rubio says he's encouraged by John Kerry's progress with China, adding, \\"we're hoping the Chinese will recalibrate.\\" On the gun debate: \\"Guns are what people are using.

According to Politico, Rubio is emphasizing the importance of rigorous background checks for immigrants, stating that only those without a criminal background will qualify for the proposed guest worker permit system. Rubio explains that the Gang of Eight's immigration plan \\"is not a special path\\" and enforces \\"consequences\\" for violators, addressing concerns from conservatives. It, in fact, aims to improve conditions for Americans as well, as the current immigration status quo is \\"horrible for America.\\" In addition to vigorously supporting the immigration reform, Senator Rubio shared his thoughts on other key issues. Regarding Jay-Z's trip to Cuba, he criticized the musician for not being informed about the political situation and missed opportunities to meet with oppressed Cuban citizens, such as a hip-hop artist being persecuted for his political lyrics. Rubio also called out Jay-Z's adoration of Che Guevara, a known racist who believed in the superiority of white Europeans over people of African descent. On the topic of North Korea, Rubio referred to the country's ruling system as \\"a criminal syndicate\\" rather than a legitimate government. Despite this harsh view, he did express encouragement at the progress made by Secretary of State John Kerry in negotiations with China, hoping that the Chinese will \\"recalibrate\\" their approach towards North Korea. Lastly, Rubio addressed the gun debate in America, emphasizing the need for an open conversation about the root causes of violence. He argues that the focus should not solely be on the weapons used, but rather on understanding why individuals commit such horrific acts in the first place. Senator Rubio's commitment to addressing immigration reform and other pressing issues demonstrates the importance of engaging in open dialogue and seeking actionable solutions to improve the lives of both immigrants and American citizens. His dedication to examining the root causes of complex issues, such as violence and political oppression, highlights his comprehensive approach to generating well-rounded, meaningful change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have: 9007 * q - 38485 - 9187 = 9815 * q First, we need to put all the \\"q\\" terms on one side of the equation and all the numbers on the other side. Let's start with moving 9815 * q which is on the right side to the left side. To do that, we'll subtract 9815 * q from both sides: 9007 * q - 9815 * q = 38485 + 9187 Now, since both terms on the left side have a \\"q\\", we can combine them: (9007 - 9815) * q = 38485 + 9187 Now we do the math inside the parentheses and add the numbers on the right side: -808 * q = 47672 We're getting close! Now we need to find out what \\"q\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -808.

With the return of Ben Roethlisberger to action, the Steelers hosted the 3-8 Oakland Raiders. The Steelers would open with a 33-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. Oakland responded with a 48-yarder by Sebastian Janikowski, and both teams were tied 3-3 as the 2nd quarter began. Roethlisberger found Santonio Holmes for a 34-yard TD pass to begin the 2nd quarter. Oakland would put 3 points on the board after a 43-yard field goal halfway through the quarter, and the Steelers headed to Halftime with a 10-6 lead. There followed a scoreless third quarter, and in the fourth Pittsburgh's defensive struggles were exploited by the Raiders, who were able to find the end zone three times. Bruce Gradkowski would find Chaz Schilens for a 17-yard TD pass with 8:21 remaining in the game, giving Oakland their first lead of the game, 13-10. Pittsburgh responded just one minute later with a 3-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall. But Oakland would not be stopped. Gradkowski hit Louis Murphy for a 75-yard TD pass with 5:28 remaining, and the Raiders went up 20-17. Roethlisberger would make an 11-yard TD pass to Hines Ward with 1:56 remaining and the Steelers would regain the lead 24-20. All that was needed was for the Steelers' defense to keep Oakland out of the end zone and they would win.

FIV is transmitted primarily through deep bite wounds, where the virus present in the infected cat's saliva enters the body tissues of another cat. FIV+ cats can share water bowls, pellet bowls, eat from the same bowl of wet food, and use the same litter box with low danger of transmitting the disease. A vigilant pet owner who treats secondary infections can allow an infected cat to live a reasonably long life.

G-Unit gained more popularity when a remix to 50 Cent's \\"P.I.M.P.\\" was released, featuring Snoop Dogg and G-Unit. But before the group had a chance to record its debut album, Tony Yayo was sentenced to prison for a gun-possession charge as well as bail-jumping. During Tony Yayo's prison sentence, 50 Cent signed Tennessee-based rapper Young Buck to G-Unit Records and subsequently added him to the group. In 2003, the group's debut album Beg for Mercy, was released. However, while the album was being recorded, Tony Yayo was sentenced to jail on charges of gun possession. Therefore, he only makes two appearances, both were pre-recorded tracks. His face is seen on the brick wall of the album cover because he could not be photographed on account of his jail sentence. Beg for Mercy went on to sell 2.3 million copies in the US and 4 million copies worldwide. The only guest appearances on the album were R&B singers Joe and Butch Cassidy. The album's production was handled by high-profile producers such as Hi-Tek, Dr. Dre and Scott Storch, among several others. 50 Cent also served as the album's executive producer.

Christine was a misbehaving student.;","completion":"Christine was a misbehaving student. The betrayal of trust evident on Laura's face emphasized how strict their school was about maintaining a code of honor. It was not just about passing the quiz or earning a good grade but also about learning the importance of integrity. To Laura, collaborating with others without the teacher's permission was a clear breach of the rules. Laura was well aware that she and Christine were poles apart when it came to their approach to academics. Though she wasn't the brightest student in class, she believed in putting in the effort and learning from her mistakes. Laura would spend hours studying and completing her assignments with dedication while Christine often resorted to shortcuts, believing that results were more important than the process. This incident was just another example of how their personalities were vastly different. It wasn't that Laura could not empathize with Christine's panic or desire to get a passing grade, but she believed in persevering honestly rather than violating the rules. After the quiz, Laura felt morally obligated to confront Christine about her actions. She approached her cautiously, not wanting to antagonize her. \\"Christine, can we talk for a minute?\\" she asked, her tone gentle yet firm. Christine rolled her eyes but obliged, retorting with, \\"What is it now, Miss Goody Two-Shoes?\\" Laura took a deep breath, swallowing the annoyance that threatened to emerge. \\"I saw you cheating during the quiz, Christine. You know that's against school rules, and you're putting our academic integrity at risk.\\" Christine smirked, unapologetic and nonchalant. \\"Oh, please. It's just a stupid quiz.

You're robbing yourself of the opportunity to grow and learn from your experiences. And that is something that will catch up to you eventually.\\" Christine's face hardened for a moment, but she braced herself and put on an indifferent façade. \\"Thanks for the lecture, Laura. But I'm doing just fine. Now if you'll excuse me, I have better things to do.\\" As Christine walked away, Laura felt a pang of disappointment. She knew it was impossible to change people overnight, but she couldn't help but hope that her words might have some impact on her classmate. With a sigh, Laura turned her focus back to herself, maintaining her commitment to her values and the principles of the code of honor. In the days that followed, Laura continued to observe Christine's behavior in class and with her peers. Despite her apparent nonchalance, Laura could see an uncertainty in Christine's eyes now and then. It seemed that her words had not fallen entirely on deaf ears. Whether or not Christine would change was uncertain, but what mattered was that Laura had taken a stand for what was right. She refused to be a part of a process that demeaned the value of hard work and honesty. Among the many lessons that life would teach Laura, this was one she would carry with her; it was by holding onto her principles that she would face her challenges head-on and emerge as a stronger individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With a unique and evocative writing style, Neruda drew inspiration from a wide range of sources, including American poets Walt Whitman and Edgar Allan Poe, French literary giants Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire, and his fellow Chilean poet, Rubén Darío. Neruda's work was not limited to his poetic influences – he was also inspired by notable figures such as Karl Marx, Marcel Proust, and the Surrealist movement, as well as cultural shifts and political events that unfolded during his life. As a young man, Neruda adopted his pen name in tribute to the Czech writer Jan Neruda. Over time, he became deeply involved in the international poetry scene, with his work being celebrated alongside that of his close friends and contemporaries Federico García Lorca and Francisco de Quevedo. Neruda's poetry spanned a vast range of themes and genres, often reflecting his passionate love for life, his concern for social justice, and his desire for global peace. During his life, Neruda was recognized with numerous honors and awards, the most notable being the International Peace Prize. This prestigious award is a testament to his efforts to promote peace and understanding among different cultures and societies through his work as both a poet and a diplomat. Despite the immense fame and recognition, Neruda's life was not devoid of hardship and controversy, particularly in the political realm. His close ties to the Communist Party and his work as a diplomat for the Chilean government often brought him into conflict with various political regimes. Nevertheless, Neruda remained relentless in his pursuit of truth, justice, and human rights.

He had sought me out,after all. I learned from his profile that he was in a relationship and had a son. However,I'm pretty sure we won't ever write wall--to--wall,let alone e--mail each other. But he'll remain a friend of online until one of us makes a point of removing the other from his official list. My pool of friends consists of family members,college buddies,co--workers from past and present,and friends of friends. There are 35 in all. If I spent some time uploading old e--mail addresses,I'm confident that I could increase my friend count actually. A person could make a mission out of reconnecting with childhood friends,former classmates,distant cousins, and those one would like to get to know better. And some people can even handle hundreds of on--screen relationships,keeping up with the daily happenings of their small army of companions. After all,there are worse fates than having too many friends. Thanks to e--mail,the inability to schedule face--to--face meetings no longer means a friendship must come to a close. But even with e--mail,people will lose touch if one or both parties stop writing back. That's normal. People move from school to school,job to job,city to city. You never have to feel guilty for breaking away. Every day,the masterminds of Web 2. 0 find new ways of making human communication easier. However,convenience Call be a crutch . Some things shouldn't be simplified. When it comes to friendship,there can be no shortcts. Which of the following statements is NOT true? A) There are 35 people in the author's list of friends right now. B) The author communicates with all the 35 friends by e--mails. C) The list of 35 fiends doesn't include the old e--mail addresses.

What is \\"Which operating system runs on IBM-compatible machines ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"Which operating system runs on IBM-compatible machines?\\" is asking about the specific operating system(s) designed to run on personal computers that are compatible with the original IBM PC. To understand this in detail, it is essential to look at the historical context, key terms in the question, and the significance of IBM-compatible machines in the development of personal computers. Historical Context: IBM, the International Business Machines Corporation, is an American multinational technology company that launched the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in 1981. The IBM PC was a highly influential personal computer as it introduced a new standard for PCs due to its advanced design and compatibility with various hardware and software components. This made the IBM PC the blueprint for many future personal computers. Key Terms: 1. Operating System (OS) - An operating system is a critical software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides a platform for other application software to run on. It is responsible for managing tasks such as memory allocation, input/output handling, file management, and process scheduling, allowing the computer's user to interact effectively with the computer's hardware. 2. IBM-compatible machines - IBM-compatible machines, also known as PC-compatible or PC clones, are personal computers that are designed to function similarly to the original IBM PC. They follow the same hardware and software standards set by the IBM PC, which allows the same operating system and application software to work on these machines without significant modifications. This compatibility creates a broader market for both hardware and software developers. Answering the Question: To address the question, we need to identify the operating system(s) that can run on IBM-compatible personal computers. When the IBM PC was launched, it initially used the IBM PC DOS (Disk Operating System) as its primary operating system. PC DOS was a version of MS-DOS, an operating system developed by Microsoft for IBM. As IBM-compatible machines emerged, they also started adopting MS-DOS and, later, other Microsoft operating systems like Windows. The Windows operating system became the most widely-used OS in the world and transformed the personal computing landscape. While other operating systems like Linux and Apple's macOS have gained prominence over time, the IBM-compatible machines primarily run on Microsoft's operating systems. In summation, the question \\"Which operating system runs on IBM-compatible machines?\\" is inquiring about the specific operating system(s) developed to function on personal computers designed to be compatible with IBM's original PC standard. The historical answer would be MS-DOS, while today, it would primarily be various versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, with some IBM-compatible machines running Linux as an alternative choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) (Associated Press) COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) — Raucous crowds of protesters took to the streets late Thursday in California as Donald Trump brought his Republican presidential campaign to conservative Orange County after sweeping the Northeast GOP primaries. Dozens of protesters were mostly peaceful as Trump gave his speech inside the Pacific Amphitheater. After the event, however, the demonstration grew rowdy and spilled into the streets. At least four people were arrested and one Trump supporter had his face bloodied in a scuffle as he tried to drive out of the arena. One man jumped on a police car, leaving its front and rear windows smashed and the top dented in and other protests sprayed graffiti on a police car and the venue's marquee. Dozens of cars -- including those of Trump supporters trying to leave -- were stuck in the street as several hundred demonstrators blocked the road, waved Mexican flags and posed for selfies. Police in riot gear and on horseback pushed the crowd back and away from the venue. There were no major injuries and police did not use any force.The crowd began dispersing about three hours after the speech ended. Earlier in the evening, a half-dozen anti-Trump protesters taunted those waiting to get into the venue. Trump supporters surrounded one man who waved a Mexican flag and shouted \\"Build that wall! Build that wall!\\" -- a reference to Trump's call to create a barrier between the United States and Mexico to stop illegal border crossings. At one point, seven women wearing no shirts and Bernie Sanders stickers over their breasts entered the square outside the amphitheater. They said they were protesting Trump's lack of engagement on issues of gender equality and women's rights. \\"I feel like he wants to make America great again, but certainly not for women, for the LBGTQ community or for the lower class,\\" said one of the women, Tiernan Hebron. \\"He has, like, done nothing to help with gender equality or women's rights or reproductive rights or anything.\\" Trump has drawn large crowds across the country as he has campaigned for the White House and some of his events have been marred by incidents both inside and outside these venues. Earlier this week, a Trump rally in nearby Anaheim, California turned contentious when his supporters and counter protestors clashed, leaving several people struck by pepper spray. Trump was not present. Trump has drawn large crowds to most of his campaign events, and Thursday was no exception. The Pacific Amphitheatre was filled to its capacity of about 18,000 and many hundreds more were turned away. Ly Kou, 47, of Ontario, said she likes Trump because he has vowed to put the country first. \\"It's obvious that America loves Trump,\\" said Kou, who is from Laos, as she pointed at the waiting throng. \\"This thing about him being racist? Look around the crowd.\\" Trump was traveling from the rally site to the state's Republican convention in Burlington in the San Francisco Bay area. ||||| Add this Tweet to your website by copying the code below.

It traverses the entire length of the state from the Maryland state line in Delmar, Sussex County to the Pennsylvania state line in Claymont, New Castle County. US 13 connects many important cities and towns in Delaware, including Seaford, Dover, and Wilmington. The entire length of US 13 in Delaware is a multilane divided highway with the exceptions of the segment through Wilmington and parts of Philadelphia Pike in Claymont. Between the Maryland border and Dover, US 13 serves as one of the main north-south routes across the Delmarva Peninsula. From Dover north to the Wilmington area, the route is followed by the limited-access Delaware Route 1 (DE 1) toll road, which crosses the route several times and has multiple interchanges with it.

Given the question: Here's a question: The token was taken out of the folder due to being fraudulent, what was it taken from? Here are possible answers to this question: - ashtray - pocket - coin collection - slot machine - deposit box I believe the correct choice is \\"coin collection\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"\\"coin collection\\" The question implies that a token was removed from a certain location because it was found to be fraudulent. Considering the given options – ashtray, pocket, slot machine, deposit box, and coin collection – the most suitable and logical answer is \\"coin collection.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of each option: 1. Ashtray: An ashtray is a receptacle for cigarette and cigar ashes and also used for extinguishing cigarettes or cigars. It is not a place where tokens are typically stored or found. 2. Pocket: A pocket is a part of clothing, such as pants, jackets, or shirts, meant for carrying small items. While it is true that someone might carry a token in their pocket, it is unlikely that the token would be removed from a pocket exclusively due to being fraudulent. 3. Coin collection: A coin collection is a collection of coins or tokens, typically curated by a collector who values their rarity, condition, and historical significance. In this context, a fraudulent token would likely be removed to maintain the integrity and value of the collection. This makes \\"coin collection\\" the most appropriate answer. 4. Slot machine: A slot machine is a gambling device that operates by inserting coins, tokens, or paper currency. While a fraudulent token might initially be used in a slot machine, it does not make sense for it to be removed specifically from the slot machine in response to its fraudulent nature. Instead, the machine would reject the token, sending it back to the user or to a separate compartment. 5. Deposit box: A deposit box, such as a safety deposit box, is a secure box used to store valuable items, like jewelry, important documents, or cash. Although it might be possible for someone to store a token in a deposit box, it is unlikely that they would remove it specifically because it was fraudulent. A deposit box is more focused on providing security rather than determining the legitimacy of its contents. Therefore, among the given options, \\"coin collection\\" is the best answer, since it involves the curating and storage of tokens or coins and would have a direct reason to remove a fraudulent token."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to... Question: Which of the following is not mentioned in the passage as a sign of lying ?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about the coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a protÃ©gÃ© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project which would create massive amounts of clean energy for the world. Jake is also financially assisting his mother (Susan Sarandon), who has begun a new career selling real estate. When the recession of 2008 hits, Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Louis Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train because he cannot handle the stress and embarrassment of losing his company. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts, then attends a lecture given by Gordon Gekko and introduces himself afterward. Gekko tells him that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumors of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton's career to seek revenge for Zabel's suicide. Jake, aided by Gekko, learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, Jake spreads rumors about the nationalization of an Equatorial Guinea oil field...

Write a summary based on this article: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Oprah Winfrey posed in front of the Taj Mahal in Agra, January 19. Oprah Winfrey charmed her Indian audience when she came to the country earlier this year on a tour that included a brief appearance at the Jaipur Literature Festival. But now the show she was working on has aired, the spell appears to have broken. The smell of incense (tick), the sari fitting (tick), the aspirations of slum dwellers (tick), and the glitz of Bollywood (tick). Let’s not forget arranged marriages and the fact that Indians, even rich ones, “still” eat with their hands (tick, tick). India as Westerners imagine it, one stereotype at a time. This is how many in India responded to the two India-focused episodes of her primetime series “Oprah’s Next Chapter,” which aired over the weekend. In India, the people she interacted with ranged from a family of five living in a 10-foot-by-10-foot room in a Mumbai slum, to Bollywood aristocracy, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan. While her show mainly targets a mainstream American audience, many criticized Ms. Winfrey for choosing to project such a caricaturized image of India to the world. “The avg American thinking of India as a place with snake charmers and elephants as main mode of transport, I can understand. But Oprah???” said user Nandita Iyer on Twitter. “Honestly, this Oprah winfrey has made such a royal fool of herself with this,” she added. “An unflattering, outmoded, selective and clichéd representation” of India, is how one commentator, Gargi Gupta, described the first episode of the television show. Camera shots of “roadside cows chomping on garbage and roads choked with traffic,” are just some aspects of the show that Ms. Gupta said may make Indian viewers “groan.” The show wasn’t a complete write-off for Ms. Gupta, however. She found Ms. Winfrey’s approach tactful when she asked slum dwellers about their hopes and fears. “It suggests a respect for human sensitivities that television anchors in India… would do well to learn,” she writes in a piece published in the Business Standard. Not all were so kind. For Rajyasree Sen, the show didn’t have a single redeeming feature. “Myopic, unaware, ignorant and gauche. This was Middle America at its best worst,” wrote Ms. Sen of the show’s first episode in a column on Firstpost. She found Ms. Winfrey’s comment on Indians still eating with their hands particularly offensive. “I don’t know what people in America are eating their hot dogs, pizzas and tacos with but perhaps Oprah’s home has evolved cutlery for all that,” she writes. Many on Twitter agreed. “You still eat with your hands? – The shocking arrogance of a clueless rich woman,” wrote Aseem Chhabra. In her criticism of Oprah’s slum tour, Ms. Sen takes it a little far. She slams the talk-show star for avoiding “any mention of the massive LCD TV” which adorned the tiny home. “That would have killed the sob story,” she adds. (The message here seems they are poor but not that poor we should be feeling sorry for them.) Is the Indian public too sensitive when it comes to outside criticism?

After her well-publicized debut visit to the country in January when the talk show host came down to film an India special for Oprah's Next Chapter. The series saw a simulcast premiere on Discovery Channel and its affiliate TLC (The Lifestyle Channel) over the weekend, but the response to Winfrey's take on India has largely been negative. During her travels, Winfrey visited a Mumbai slum, the Jaipur Literary Festival (where she taped an interaction with noted author Deepak Chopra), a widows home in North India rounded off with a must-see trip to the Taj Mahal. The episode also filmed Winfrey spending time with families, from the slum-dwelling poor to upper crust millionaires, including being escorted by Indian film icon Amitabh Bachchan and his family to a glamorous Bollywood party hosted in her honor by leading Mumbai socialite Parmeshwar Godrej. One of the major criticisms against Winfrey is when she asks her dinner hosts, an upscale Mumbai family who lay down a lavish meal for her, “I heard some Indian people eat with their hands still?” Leading news channel CNN-IBN (a joint venture between CNN and leading broadcasting group Network18) posted an “open letter to Oprah Winfrey from an Indian who eats with her hand” on its website penned by Rituparna Chatterjee, “Oprah, your comment about eating with the hand is really not that big a deal to us; we are used to gross Western ignorance regarding our ancient country. But as a responsible public figure about to air a show that will be beamed across the world, you should have done your homework. Using our hands to eat is a well established tradition and a fact none of us are ashamed of. Our economic distinction has nothing to do with it. A millionaire here eats the same way a pauper does. You have been to Asian nations. You should know that. ” Questioning Winfrey's motives, Chatterjee adds, “Poverty is an inseparable part of India, you say, and seek out the human stories that make the grind bearable. But which India have you come looking for? The one that shops at state-of-the-art supermarkets and vacations abroad or the one whining about their misery in tiny holes of homes with LCD televisions on the walls? The India that scrapes by with 200 a month but sends its children to subsidized government schools to pick up fluent English? The India of your press information - fascinating, with its many-headed goddesses and grimy, naked children playing by roadside hovels - or the India of the future - an economic superpower that looms large outside the range of an average American's myopic vision? ” A critique of the show by online news site Firstpost.com writer Rajyasree Sen described the two-episode series as “myopic, unaware, ignorant and gauche. This was Middle America at its best worst.” Winfrey's tour of a Mumbai slum, where she meets a family of five living in a cramped room, was also criticized by Sen, “And the slum is where Oprah’s 'oh-my-god-how wonderfully-pathetically-quaint-to-be-so-poor' avatar stepped out in full glory. .. Now I’m not surprised that Oprah was surprised to see an entire family living in such tiny quarters. Although I’m sure she could find cramped ghettos in the U.S... She did look for a shower head in the toilet and seem amazed to hear they bathed with a bucket. And she marveled at how all their clothes fit onto a small shelf. She pointedly avoided any mention of the massive LCD TV which adorned their wall. That would have killed the sob story. When their older daughter told Oprah that she’d like to go to London to study further, Oprah also played her role as American ambassador to the hilt and said, “No. Come to America, it’s a lovely country. It’s the best”.” Another review of the show by leading newspaper group Dainik Bhaskar posted the headline “Snobbish Oprah Mocks India.” “In a typical American snooty style, the talk show queen tried to portray a superficial ‘sob story’. Oprah was anything but a good guest when she went around the small room interrogating the family members about their ‘poor’ living style and ‘miserly’ living.” In its coverage of how the show got a “thumbs down”, India Real Time (the Wall Street Journal's India-specific blog) said, “The smell of incense (tick), the sari fitting (tick), the aspirations of slum dwellers (tick), and the glitz of Bollywood (tick). Let’s not forget arranged marriages and the fact that Indians, even rich ones, “still” eat with their hands (tick, tick). India as Westerners imagine it, one stereotype at a time.” But a few of the many online comments to the India Real Time story supported Winfrey's coverage of India's reality. “The views Oprah presented are cliched BUT TRUE! I am an Indian who lives in the U.S... To many middle and upper class families, the India Oprah presents simply does not exist. I was shocked to speak to members of my family and they denied that people are dying of malnutrition and starvation below their very ivory towers”, said a post by RJ. “Oprah showed what she saw in India. What’s wrong with that? If we can’t clean up our act, then we have no business feeling offended,” said another post by Esh. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

But there's laughter around the table. You will soon realize that food humour is the best kind of humour in India, next only to toilet humour. The upper-middleclass family you visit offers you a thali, an assortment of food that in India is considered a filling and balanced meal. The man of the house points to a green lump in the corner. \\"That's okra.\\" \\"This? This is okra?\\" Only, in India we call it ladies finger. In fact, if vegetable vendors had their way bhindi would join bandobast in the English dictionary any day. I am mildly thankful to you for not referring to it as gumbo, which I am sure would have baffled millions watching the spectacle that you made of our way of life. You are helplessly disarming when you ask your host to show you how to eat with your hand. \\"I have never eaten with my hand but I can try.\\" They fall over each other to oblige. Use one finger to hold the bread (puri) down and tear like this. Now dip it in anything you want. See? So easy. Oprah, you brave, brave thing, you are now one of us. Millions of us risk infection every day to eat food with our hands. When a child is born we teach it to eat with the hand. In the desolate, backward hole we live in, this is considered perfectly normal. Our table manners are minimal but they do not include humiliating our host with a question that plainly indicates our backwardness. We, the Indians who amaze you with our resilience and our sparse lives in 10X10 slum chawls, have always thought you were well travelled, well read and well spoken. How do we know? We watch your show of course. We have had cable television revolution since 1992. Poverty is an inseparable part of India, you say, and seek out the human stories that make the grind bearable. But which India have you come looking for? The one that shops at state-of-the-art supermarkets and vacations abroad or the one whining about their misery in tiny holes of homes with LCD televisions on the walls? The India that scrapes by with 200 a month but sends its children to subsidised government schools to pick up fluent English? The India of your press information - fascinating, with its many-headed goddesses and grimy, naked children playing by roadside hovels - or the India of the future - an economic superpower that looms large outside the range of an average American's myopic vision? Oprah, your comment about eating with the hand is really not that big a deal to us; we are used to gross Western ignorance regarding our ancient country. But as a responsible public figure about to air a show that will be beamed across the world, you should have done your homework. Using our hands to eat is a well established tradition and a fact none of us are ashamed of. Our economic distinction has nothing to do with it. A millionaire here eats the same way a pauper does. You have been to Asian nations. You should know that. In fact, we scoff at people who try to tackle their pizzas and rotis with cutlery. In one sweeping, general statement you linked the usage of cutlery to our progress. If anything, the mockery brings out in sharper focus the underlying insecurity and the latent threat developed nations sense from third world countries such as ours. Do you say you did not mean it as an offence? It is then an abominable insensitivity to Indian hospitality. I am a part of the nation that struggles to give its people a livelihood and sometimes fails to even provide basic amenities such as a showerhead in their bathrooms (gasp!). Don't even get me started on our problems; you will miss your flight back. We have seriously twisted issues but shooting innocent people at random inside a cinema theatre is not one of them. Our problems are generically different from yours. But we don't make a spectacle out of yours. That's the difference. You have become the butt of jokes here, some well deserved, some not so much. Did you think the idea of 'India' is the culmination of an Algebraic equation? You are not alone in this sweeping ignorance and larger insensitivity. But you are a powerful brand ambassador of the America that tries to make sense of Indians. If this is the level of awareness you bring to our country, and the half-informed truths you take back, I feel apprehensive for the people you influence. Yes, we eat with our hands and it's high time we stop eating out of yours.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: London police are well known in the world. Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement is to meet changing conditions and provide excellent police service . The two main reasons for the Force's development were the growth of population and the progress of science and technology.

Question: If Milo calms down and his heart starts pumping less blood with each stroke, what happens to his heart rate increases or decreases? Answer:","completion":"If Milo calms down and his heart starts pumping less blood with each stroke, his heart rate would likely increase in order to maintain the same volume of blood flow throughout his body. According to the given paragraph, when the heart expels more blood with each stroke, it has to beat less frequently to maintain the same blood flow. Therefore, if the heart starts pumping less blood with each stroke, it would need to compensate by increasing the frequency of its beats. This would result in an increased heart rate. In summary, when the heart pumps less blood, it requires more beats per minute to maintain the required blood circulation, leading to an increased heart rate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Eight people were stalked by the animal for three hours, and one man who tried to escape the furry captor was forced to fight it off with his bicycle after the fox gave chase. It joins mischievous peacocks, a violent swan nicknamed Asbo and fugitive felines among the annals of England's animals \\"gone bad\\". Here are some more that made the headlines. A peacock called Kevin was accused of \\"making mischief\\" in Breadsall, Derbyshire, in June 2013. His antics included trapping someone in the village's memorial hall. \\"The person was trying to leave and Kevin wouldn't let them out,\\" said resident Marilyn Balsom. The villagers tried and failed to find the owners after Kevin turned up out of nowhere. Two years later, Kevin is still causing trouble in Breadsall, although some villagers have come to love the feathered celebrity. The Bishops Court Estate in Clyst St Mary, Devon, has also had problems with peacocks, which have been attacking cars by scratching and pecking at the paintwork. The \\"jealous\\" peacocks are thought to be mistaking their reflections for rival birds. A hungry badger was caught on camera when it sneaked into a house to help itself to a Bakewell tart in Midhurst, West Sussex. The badger realised it had an audience then made a sharp exit through the kitchen catflap. But he was not deterred from coming back on subsequent nights, forcing the resident to lock his catflap. Back in 2003, a rogue badger attacked five people during a 48-hour rampage in Evesham, Worcestershire. One man required two skin graft operations, and other victims included a man who was attacked as he walked home from a pub. Oscar the cat gained a reputation after a series of clashes with cats and dogs in the Buckinghamshire village of Wingrave. His fame then spread when a local newspaper reported the pet had disappeared after being \\"under curfew\\" for scratching and biting a neighbour. He was found 34 miles away in Northampton about three weeks later, kept indoors to restore village harmony and given a herbal remedy to calm him down. A cockerel called William was served with a noise abatement notice last year - or rather, his owners were - because he was crowing too loudly in Eyam, Derbyshire. Owner Phillip Sutcliffe said: \\"Apparently he crows too loud in the morning - he joins the dawn chorus with all the other birds in the area and one person has complained.\\" Mr Sutcliffe had tried to advertise William for sale and said he might have to kill him if there were no takers. William's fate is unknown. A mischievous grey squirrel jumped into a woman's handbag at a pub in Chester and refused to leave - prompting her to call police. Det Con Nigel Thake, who attended and managed to send the persistent animal on its way, was dubbed \\"Dr Doolittle\\" on the police's Twitter account. A \\"terrorist\\" pheasant attacked vehicles and chased cats and dogs at Wood Farm in Hail Weston, Cambridgeshire. One delivery driver was trapped for 20 minutes after the bird blocked his way, flew at the bonnet then chased his van. The British Trust for Ornithology said the pheasant was protecting his territory but was \\"a little extreme\\". He later turned up with a hen pheasant and was \\"tamed by love\\". Another pheasant, named Phil, started attacking members of a Shropshire family, forcing one of them to carry a badminton racket for self-defence. Resolute vegan and animal lover Sally-Ann Hudson started feeding the bird in a failed bid to befriend him. \\"He'll just have a go at me then, he'll launch at me, peck my feet or attach himself to my arm and just try to attack me,\\" she said. Another pheasant started attacking people in the North Yorkshire village of Newsham, with other targets including dogs, prams and cars. The animal has also chased children from their school bus, and one villager said she was scared to go out. A postman, who said he was frightened of the bird, described it as \\"a crackpot\\". Theo the cat was responsible for a mini crime spree in Ipswich when he kept stealing items from neighbours' homes, including a phone charger, hand puppet, pen and a child's artwork. His owners kept finding things around the home that did not belong to them, and had to post photos on Facebook to track down the owners. Theo then started bringing home Christmas decorations pilfered from neighbours' trees. The antics of a cat in Luton, called Dennis, have been well-documented on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. His owner said Dennis prefers to steal underwear but usually brought home gifts of Christmas wrapping paper - minus the contents - after the big day. Another cat, Naughty Norris, prowled the Bedminster area, bringing home everything from sports bras and boxer shorts to dishcloths and sausages. His embarrassed owner, Richard Windsor, wrote an apologetic note to neighbours explaining Norris's behaviour, and inviting them to reclaim their missing items. A crow repeatedly attacked a mirror sculpture at the University of Leicester, thinking its reflection was another bird. Scratches began appearing on the sculpture within a day of an exhibition starting, while sixteen other sculptures in the exhibition remained unscathed. Almuth Tebbenhoff, the exhibition's curator, said: \\"As its fury escalated it saw its reflection and became more and more aggressive. \\"Isn't this how wars start?\\" An aggressive swan named Asbo was moved from the River Cam in Cambridge after his aggressive behaviour began to escalate. In one of many reported attacks on rowers, the swan mounted a scull and capsized the boat. Dr Philippa Noon, one of the Conservators of the River Cam, said he had started going for bigger boats and they were concerned his legs could be cut off by a motor. \\"We are sad to see him go, because he had become a bit of a river character,\\" she said. Pianist Paul Lewis was forced to pull out of concert after a swooping seagull caused him to injure himself. He was leaving rehearsals with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra when he was startled, causing him to fall and sprain a finger. In Bristol, the opening date of a Wahaca restaurant has been pushed back because seagulls have been pecking and defecating on builders. Work was forced to stop because of the seagulls, which are thought to be protecting their young. There have been numerous other reports of seagulls attacking people, with one attack in Folkestone described as like something out of a Hitchcock film. In Cornwall, postal deliveries were suspended to a road after a delivery woman was attacked by gulls. One man in Hull said he had been repeatedly targeted by a flock while walking on a cycle path and said they were the most frightening experiences of his life. He described being followed for about a mile down the road in one incident, and flapping his arms to deter them another time. Dr Viola Ross-Smith, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said the birds were a protected species defending their nests. She said gull numbers were increasing in cities due to easy access to food and a lack of predators. A petition was set up calling for action in Roundway, Wiltshire, where seagulls were said to be attacking people, leaving mess and keeping residents awake.

Title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her...

How to view fall foliage<br>Consider the timing of the peak foliage in autumn. The fall color season usually runs from late september to mid-october. [substeps] Fall foliage is determined by a number of factors, including shorter days, colder nights and the amount of moisture in the ground. Choose your answer: based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Fall color is not dependant on rainfall.\\"? OPT: * Yes * It's impossible to say * No I think the answer is","completion":"No, based on the paragraph, we cannot conclude that \\"Fall color is not dependant on rainfall.\\" In fact, it mentions that fall foliage is determined by a number of factors, including the amount of moisture in the ground. This implies that rainfall plays a role in the development of fall colors. Fall foliage is a spectacular natural phenomenon that occurs when the leaves of deciduous trees change colors before falling off during the autumn season. This event is influenced by a combination of factors such as sunlight, temperature, and moisture availability. Let's examine these factors more closely: 1. Shorter days: As the days become shorter during the fall season, the amount of sunlight received by the trees decreases. This reduction in sunlight triggers a change in the production of chlorophyll, the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis in leaves. With less chlorophyll being produced, the green color of the leaves starts to fade, allowing other pigments present in the leaves, like carotenes and anthocyanins, to become more visible. These pigments are responsible for the vibrant yellow, orange, and red hues seen in fall foliage. 2. Colder nights: As the temperature drops during autumn, especially at night, it influences the rate at which chlorophyll breaks down in the leaves. Lower temperatures cause the chlorophyll to break down more rapidly, which further contributes to the revealing of other pigments, intensifying the colors of fall foliage. 3. Moisture in the ground: Rainfall and soil moisture can have significant impacts on the quality and timing of fall foliage. Adequate moisture in the ground during the growing season helps ensure that trees are healthy and well-nourished. This, in turn, contributes to a better display of autumn colors. On the other hand, a dry summer season or a drought might lead to less vibrant or short-lived fall colors, as stressed trees may lose their leaves earlier or exhibit duller colors. To view fall foliage, it is essential to consider all these factors when choosing the location and timing of your trip. Some steps to take when planning to view fall foliage are: 1. Research the peak foliage times for your desired location: Since the timing of peak foliage can vary depending on the region you are visiting, consult regional foliage reports or contact local tourism offices to determine the best time to plan your trip. 2. Select a location that offers varied tree species: Different tree species exhibit distinct fall colors, so visiting an area with diverse tree species can result in a more spectacular display of foliage. 3. Scout for vantage points: Plan your trip to include locations offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, such as mountain overlooks or scenic drives, to fully appreciate the beauty of fall foliage. 4. Check weather forecasts: Although you cannot control the weather, it can be beneficial to monitor weather forecasts leading up to your visit. Ideal fall foliage viewing conditions usually include clear, sunny days with cool, crisp air. Rain and wind can cause leaves to fall more quickly, shortening the duration of the peak foliage season. Taking all these factors into account when planning your fall foliage trip will help ensure that you experience the beauty of autumn colors in all their glory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A day after allegations surfaced that Northampton boys soccer players used Ebola to taunt a West African opponent, the team's coaches have resigned and its players could face discipline, according to a school official. The district on Tuesday finished its investigation into whether soccer players made \\"inappropriate comments\\" to a Nazareth player, Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said Tuesday evening. \\"The administration has conducted a thorough investigation throughout the entire day and appropriate discipline will be dispensed to any students who violated the code of conduct,\\" Kovalchik said. Due to student confidentially, Kovalchik would not state the actual form of discipline or how many students will face discipline. He would also not reveal the investigation's findings. The team's head coach, Craig Carvin, and assistant coach, Jason Melniszyn, submitted their resignations Tuesday evening, Kovalchik said. Neither could be reached for comment, and Kovalchik said he had no comment other than stating neither is a district teacher. Edward Bachert, custodian for the 16-year-old West African soccer player, said the teen told him he was peppered with Ebola comments at last Thursday's game at Nazareth. Other Nazareth players told Bachert their opponents directed racial remarks at the teen as well, said Bachert, who was at the game but out of earshot. The teen came to America with siblings about three years ago and is from a small town in Guinea, ground zero of the Ebola outbreak, Bachert said. Bachert's family took in the teen two years ago, but he constantly worries about the health of his parents, who still live in their home village. Distressed by the alleged Ebola remarks, the teen charged a Northampton player during the game's waning minutes and was ejected, Bachert said. He cried at the kitchen table when he got home. The end of the investigation brings closure to the incident, Bachert said. \\"I am glad Nazareth and Northampton took this incident very seriously and did a very thorough investigation,\\" Bachert said. \\"I think kids nowadays have to realize that their words can cause a lot of damage and you've got to think before you speak and be careful with what words you choose.\\" Bachert is comfortable not knowing for sure what discipline Northampton players could receive, he said. He also said he believes the Northampton coaches made the right decision in resigning. Nazareth conducted its own investigation of Thursday's game and turned its findings over to Northampton earlier Tuesday, Superintendent Dennis Riker said. He did not reveal the district's findings and could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. Neither district confirmed that their investigations were related to remarks about Ebola or race, but Kovalchik said Monday that Northampton doesn't tolerate any form of discrimination and the district would follow all policies and procedures if warranted. On Tuesday, he thanked Riker for Nazareth's cooperation. Incidents like the one that happened in Nazareth are usually handled on the local level by the schools themselves and not the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, said Melissa Mertz, associate executive director of the PIAA. \\"I wouldn't say incidents like these are common, but they are almost always handled by the schools or by the district committee,\\" Mertz said, noting that no one had brought the Nazareth incident to her attention. \\"Often, the athletic director of one school will pick up the phone and call the athletic director of the other school. Sometimes, that's all it takes.\\" Nazareth students said after school Tuesday some kind of punishment is in order if the allegations against Northampton players are true. \\"And they should have to apologize,\\" sophomore Marissa Plows said. The Nazareth soccer team has rallied behind their teammate in response to the incident and players are using social media to promote selling 2 wristbands that say \\"#ENDRACISM.\\" The teen from West Africa was suspended for his team's regular-season finale Friday. He did not play in Nazareth's league playoff loss over the weekend because he was so distressed, Bachert said. Nazareth plays in the district tournament next week, and Bachert hopes the teen will play. \\"You don't realize how hurtful some of these things really are until you see it firsthand,\\" Bachert said. adam.clark@mcall.com 610-820-6168 ||||| A West African player on Nazareth Area High School's boys soccer team was taunted by Northampton players with chants of \\"Ebola!\\" during a game last week, according to his legal guardian. Edward Bachert, custodian for the 16-year-old soccer player, said the teen told him Ebola comments peppered last Thursday's game at Nazareth. Other Nazareth players told Bachert their opponents directed racial slurs at the teen as well, said Bachert, who was at the game but out of earshot. School officials in Nazareth and Northampton confirmed Monday they are investigating reports of inappropriate language used by Northampton players, but neither district would specify what the students allegedly said. \\"I don't know exactly what was said at this [game], and we don't have anything concrete that this was said,\\" said Joseph Kovalchik, superintendent of the Northampton Area School District. \\"Right now we need to really dig into this and investigate both sides.\\" Northampton doesn't tolerate any form of discrimination and the district will follow all policies and procedures if warranted, Kovalchik said. The allegations were not discussed Monday night at the Northampton school board meeting. \\"We are not at that point yet of knowing what actually did happen,\\" board President David Gogel said after the meeting. Bachert told the teen's story after he was contacted by The Morning Call, which received two letters from fans who attended the game and alleged Northampton players hurled racist remarks at a black player on Nazareth's team. One of the writers said Northampton players said they hoped he contracted Ebola. The teen came to America with siblings about three years ago and is from a small town in Guinea, ground zero of the Ebola outbreak, Bachert said. Bachert's family took the teen in two years ago, but he constantly worries about the health of his parents, who still live in their home village. Distressed by the alleged Ebola remarks, the teen charged a Northampton player during the game's waning minutes and was ejected, Bachert said. He cried at the kitchen table when he got home. \\"He was upset on the field, he was upset when I saw him after the game, he was upset when he came home,\\" Bachert said. Bachert did not hear any of the alleged comments from the stands but learned of them through the teen and his teammates. Several players vented after the game on Twitter. \\"I take pride in my soccer team. They are like my brothers. When racial slurs are being said we as a team take it very personally,\\" one Nazareth player tweeted. A fellow player tweeted: \\"Literally lost all my respect for that team and it's coaches, after being racist and getting a kid sent off you don't hi five your friend.\\" Bachert does not believe the Northampton players knew the teen had moved from Africa or that his parents still live there. But he thinks they need to be held accountable. \\"This doesn't belong in society,\\" he said. \\"It certainly doesn't belong in the field.\\" Nazareth Athletic Director Thomas Moll met with several players Friday morning to get as much information as possible about what happened, Moll said. School was closed Monday for Columbus Day and the investigation will continue Tuesday, he said. \\"I don't want to say anything at this point,\\" Moll said. \\"I want to meet with our principal and our superintendent to let them know what we found.\\" Northampton's schools were also closed Monday, hindering the district's ability to investigate, Kovalchik said.

Nazareth was forced to play a player down after the teen was ejected, and the Blue Eagles then gave up the game-winning goal in a 2-1 loss. The team still qualified for the postseason. Northampton's season is over, but the district must now manage another allegation of racism. A borough resident launched an online petition last September seeking to have the school's Konkrete Kids nickname changed because he believed the three Ks are a nod to the Ku Klux Klan. The district defended the name, saying it is rooted in its ties to the cement industry, since the spelling was gleaned from the German spelling of the word concrete. adam.clark@mcall.com 610-820-6168 ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief explanation of the main points or important information in a text or story.

Va. denied federal aid for tornado damage Jun 23, 2011 08:43 PM EDT The state was notified Thursday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied a trio of appeals for federal assistance to help residents recover from 34 tornadoes that struck Virginia in April. Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) appealed FEMA’s denial of the requests last month for Pulaski, Halifax and Washington counties, where storms left 10 dead, 100 injured and 212 homes damaged. He also asked that April 8-28 be considered as one period so that other localities could be added. “The denial of assistance will definitely have an impact on those struggling to recover,’’ McDonnell said in a statement. “Despite this decision by the federal government, I know that Virginians will continue to work together to help their fellow citizens who are still in need almost two months after these storms have faded from the headlines.” Virginia will pursue assistance from the Small Business Administration in the form of low-interest loans for homeowners, renters and business owners who suffered damage. “I am extremely disappointed in FEMA’s denial of Virginia’s request for disaster assistance,’’ U.S. Sen. Mark Warner (D) said in a statement. “It is hard to explain how Virginia families and businesses do not qualify for disaster aid when that designation was granted to similar communities in other states which saw what appears to be the same level of damage from this same storm system.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article, published on June 23, 2011, discusses the denial of federal aid to Virginia by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for the damages caused by 34 tornadoes that struck the state in April.

Given the question: Information: - The Stolen Jools (1931) is a short comedy film produced by the Masquers Club of Hollywood, featuring many cameo appearances by film stars of the day. The stars appeared in the film, distributed by Paramount Pictures, to raise funds for the National Vaudeville Artists Tuberculosis Sanitarium. The UCLA Film and Television Archive entry for this film saysas do the creditsthat the film was co-sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes to support the \\"fine work\\" of the NVA sanitarium. - Vitaphone was a sound film system used for feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects made by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1931. Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected. Many early talkies, such as \\"The Jazz Singer\\" (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \\"Vitaphone\\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \\"living\\" and \\"sound\\". - Warner Leroy Baxter (March 29, 1889 May 7, 1951) was an American actor, known for his role as The Cisco Kid in \\"In Old Arizona\\" (1929), for which he won the second Academy Award for Best Actor in the 19281929 Academy Awards. He frequently played womanizing, charismatic Latin bandit types in westerns, and played The Cisco Kid or a similar character throughout the 1930s, but had a range of other roles throughout his career. Warner Baxter started his movie career in silent film. Baxter's most notable silent films are \\"The Great Gatsby\\" (1926) and \\"The Awful Truth\\" (1925). When talkies came out, Baxter became even more famous. Baxter's most notable talkies are \\"In Old Arizona\\" (1929), \\"42nd Street\\" (1932), \\"Slave Ship\\" (1937), \\"Kidnapped\\" (1938), and the 1931 20 minute all-star ensemble short film, \\"The Stolen Jools\\". In the 1940s he was well known for his recurring role as Dr. Robert Ordway in the Crime Doctor series of 10 films. - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Mismates is a 1926 silent film starring Doris Kenyon and Warner Baxter .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: CBS Local — An annual survey of how well Americans are preparing for retirement has found that a large number of people are at risk of leaving the workforce with barely anything saved up. According to personal finance website GoBankingRates.com, 42 percent of Americans polled said they have less than 10,000 saved for their eventual retirement. The 2018 poll of 1,000 people, ranging from millennials to baby boomers, found that nearly 14 percent of Americans have absolutely nothing saved for the future. Over 28 percent of the respondents claimed that they have under 10,000 put away for retirement. The future for millennials was particularly bleak, with nearly 60 percent of young Americans saying they have almost nothing set aside for their old age. The most common reasons people gave for the lack of savings included, “I don’t make enough money to save” and “I’m struggling to pay bills.” While this year’s survey isn’t the greatest news for American workers, the results are actually a big improvement from GoBankingRates’ 2017 survey. The financial advisers found 55 percent of people had under 10,000 saved last year. The number of Americans saying they had nothing for retirement was 20 percent higher (34 percent) one year ago. “The amount of people who don’t even know an individual retirement plan is available is astounding,” Tom Zgainer, CEO of America’s Best 401k said. Zgainer added that many workers don’t know about their 401k options at work and are not making the most of their company’s retirement plans. On a positive note, this year’s survey found that more Americans have been able to save over 300,000 for their senior years. Sixteen percent of the country reached the poll’s highest savings threshold, compared to 14 percent in 2017. ||||| If you're falling behind on your retirement savings, you're not alone. Roughly 61% of Americans have less than 100,000 in total savings, and around 42% of those people have saved 10,000 or less, according to a recent GoBankingRates survey. The No. 1 reason people gave for not having much stashed away? That they don't earn enough money to be able to save anything. No matter how much money you make, it's important to save for retirement unless you plan to work the rest of your life. The good news is that even small contributions to your retirement fund can add up over time, so even if you're not loaded with cash, you can still beef up your nest egg by the time you retire. Starting small is better than not starting at all Through the power of compound interest, your savings can grow exponentially over time -- which means that the earlier you start saving, the better. And if you start early enough, even the smallest contributions can ultimately grow to hundreds of thousands of dollars. For example, say you're just starting out saving and can contribute 50 per month. If you're earning a 7% annual rate of return on your investments, that 50 per month can turn into around 124,275 over 40 years. Granted, that may not be enough to last you through retirement, but it's infinitely better than not contributing anything and ending up with zero retirement savings. Also, by waiting even a few years to start saving, you'll have a much more difficult time catching up. In this instance, if you're saving 50 per month, waiting just five years to start saving will leave you with just 86,054, rather than 124,275 had you started saving earlier -- a difference of nearly 40,000. If you start early enough, even big savings goals are more achievable. For instance, say you want to have 500,000 saved by the time you turn 65. If you're earning a 7% rate of return on your investments each year, here's how much you'd have to save every month to meet that goal depending on when you start saving: Age You Start Saving Contributions per Month Total Savings at Age 65 25 200 497,102 35 425 499,827 45 980 500,198 55 2,900 498,855 This is not to say that if you get a late start that it's not worth saving at all; even a small retirement fund is better than no retirement savings at all. But if you're stuck in the starting gate because you're worried small contributions are worthless, it's better to put whatever you can toward your retirement fund while time is on your side. The 401(k): Your secret weapon If you have access to a 401(k) through your employer with matching contributions, take full advantage of it. Those matching contributions from your employer can double your savings, creating even bigger gains over time. For example, say you're earning 40,000 per year, and your employer will match 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your salary -- or up to 1,200 per year. If you contribute 1,200 per year yourself (or 100 per month), that brings your total yearly savings to 2,400. At that rate, assuming a 7% annual rate of return on your savings, you'll have around 512,663 saved after 40 years. Not bad for contributing what amounts to around 3 per day. Even if you can't contribute enough to earn the full employer match, every little bit counts -- after all, not contributing anything is essentially leaving free money on the table. If you're contributing, say, 50 per month (or 600 per year) and your employer matches that 600 per year, you'll end up with just over 250,000 after 40 years. Again, not too bad for making relatively small contributions each month. When you're focused on just paying the bills each month, saving for retirement may be the last thing on your mind. But you don't need a lot of money to build up your retirement fund, because even baby steps will take you a long way over the course of your career. ||||| While many Americans spend their through assets in old age, a surprising number have more savings two decades after retiring than they do when they leave their jobs. The phenomenon is yet another chapter in the story of old age in the U.S.—which might be titled A Tale Of Two Retirements. A new study by Sudipto Banerjee of the Employee Benefit Research Institute paints the picture: Over the first 18 years of retirement, about one-third of seniors in two large national studies increased their assets. This was true even among those who began with relatively little wealth. Typical older adults who had less than 500,000 in financial assets at retirement spent about one-quarter of their nest eggs within the first two decades after getting the proverbial gold watch—a significant amount but less than many retirement models predict. Hanging on to assets Not surprisingly, Banerjee found that those who retired with non-housing assets in excess of 500,000 were more likely to increase their wealth in old age. And he found that those with old-style defined benefit pensions spent less of their wealth than those without them. But a surprising number of seniors—even those with limited financial resources—held on to their financial assets, at least for the first couple of decades after retirement. They apparently did it by reducing their spending to match their income so they did not have to dip into savings. Banerjee defined non-housing assets as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings accounts, CDs, housing except for a primary residence, and the value of automobiles. Wealth was net of debt. He excluded 401(k)s. Then, he divided retirees into three groups: Those with less than 200,000 just before retirement, those with 200,000-500,000, and those with more than 500,000. The surprising story Median assets for the lowest income group dropped from about 32,000 at retirement to 24,000 after 18 years. That’s a decline of about one-quarter. But here is where the story gets really interesting: About one in five in this group had only 20%of their assets remaining after just four years of retirement. No surprise there. But 35% had more savings after 18 years than when they started. For those with a moderate amount of wealth, median assets fell from about 302,000 to 243,000 after 18 years—a decline of about 27%. But here again the average is misleading. About 16% had only 20% of their assets left after two decades, while 37% had more than when they retired. The very old and the very sick The highest asset group started with an average of about 857,000 and still had about 756,000 after two decades. Among this group, about 12 percent was left with only 20% of their assets after 18 years, while 35% saw their nest eggs grow after two decades. Other research confirms Banerjee’s basic story. But a closer look at spending patterns in old age helps explain why some seniors in all wealth groups increase assets in old age while others spend all their savings and become impoverished: the need for high levels of medical and long-term care. In a separate paper, Banerjee looks at the wide variation of health care costs (including nursing home expenses) for those aged 70 and older. The average out-of-pocket cost of care from age 70 to death is about 27,000. But the cost for the top 10% is 172,000 and the top 5% is 269,000. In this study, Banerjee is looking at a slightly different population (age 70 to death instead of the first two decades after retirement) and costs for the very old are higher than even those in their early 80s. But the basic message remains: While average out-of-pocket health care costs are manageable for even middle- income seniors, the relatively few with high medical costs easily can be ruined by the expense. A 2015 paper by Jim Poterba, Steven Venti, and David Wise for the National Bureau of Economic Research also looked at the changes in financial assets of those aged 70 and older. They found savings were typically very stable: Those who were poor before they retired tended to die poor. Those with substantial assets at age 70 died with significant amounts of wealth. A more complex story But there were two exceptions: Those who lived to a very old age (90 or older) spent more of their resources in their last years. And those who either divorced or suffered adverse health events, such as strokes, were more likely to run out of money. It is common for progressives to focus on those older adults who outlive their assets, while many conservatives point to data that show average savings and costs in old age and conclude there is no “retirement savings crisis.” This important research tells a more complicated story: While a surprising number of seniors hold on to their assets in the first years after retirement, some—especially those who have few assets to begin with, live a long time in old age, or who suffer from serious illness—will indeed become impoverished. ||||| The tide might be turning when it comes to retirement savings in America. For the third year in a row, GOBankingRates surveyed adults across the U.S. to find out how much the average person has saved for retirement. From 2016 to 2017, the percentage of Americans with 0 saved increased. But this year, it dropped — dramatically. Not only has the percentage of adults with nothing saved fallen, but the percentage of those with 300,000 or more in a retirement nest egg has increased. Keep reading to find out if Americans are saving enough for retirement. How Much Does the Average American Have Saved for Retirement? GOBankingRates polled adults across the U.S. using three Google Consumer Surveys to find out how much the average American has saved for retirement. Each survey targeted a specific age group — millennials, Generation X and baby boomers — and included about 1,000 respondents per group. Each age group was asked the same question: “By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement?” Respondents could select one of the following options: – Less than 10,000 – 10,000 to 49,999 – 50,000 to 99,999 – 100,000 to 199,999 – 200,000 to 299,999 – 300,000 or more The 2018 Retirement Savings survey found that 42 percent of Americans have less than 10,000 saved. If they don’t boost their savings, they’ll likely retire broke because that’s not enough to cover a year’s worth of expenses. On average, adults 65 and older spend almost 46,000 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Included in that 42 percent with less than 10,000 saved is the 14 percent of respondents with absolutely nothing saved for retirement. This group could be at the most risk of retiring broke if they don’t start taking steps to catch up on retirement savings. On the other hand, the survey found that the majority of Americans have more than 10,000 saved for retirement. – Nearly 7 percent said they have 10,000 to 49,999 saved. – Nearly 13 percent said they have 50,000 to 99,999. – More than 12 percent said they have 100,000 to 199,999. – Nearly 10 percent have 200,000 to 299,999. – About 16 percent have 300,000 or more in retirement savings. Women Still Lag Behind Men in Retirement Savings A nearly equal percentage of women and men have absolutely no retirement savings. But when you combine the percentage with no savings with the percentage who have saved 10,000 or less, the survey results show that women continue to lag behind men. Q: By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement? Gender 0 Less than 10,000 10,000 to 49,999 50,000 to 99,999 100,000 to 199,999 200,000 to 299,999 300,000 or more Female 13.86% 31.38% 7.70% 13.42% 11.80% 8.65% 13.20% Male 13.58% 26.25% 5.85% 11.94% 12.24% 10.96% 19.18% Men are still more likely than women to have larger retirement account balances. The 2018 survey found that 45 percent of women have no savings or 10,000 or less, compared with 40 percent of men. However, that’s an improvement from 2017, when 58 percent of women had no savings or less than 10,000 saved. In 2016, 63 percent of women had less than 10,000 saved or nothing at all. Did You Know? Women Aren’t Living as Comfortably as Men in Retirement — Here’s Why 57% of Millennials Have 10K or Less Saved for Retirement It’s not surprising that the youngest generation (millennials) is more likely to have less in savings than older generations. At 18 percent, millennials ages 18 to 34 have the highest percentage of respondents with 0 saved. And another 39 percent of respondents in this age group have less than 10,000 saved. However, the total percentage of millennials with nothing or less than 10,000 saved has shrunk to 57 percent this year from 71 percent in 2017. And the percentage of this generation with 300,000 or more saved has grown to 9 percent from 5 percent. Q: By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement? Ages 0 Less than 10,000 10,000 to 49,999 50,000 to 99,999 100,000 to 199,999 200,000 to 299,999 300,000 or more 18-34 18.18% 39.16% 6.69% 11.59% 8.69% 6.69% 8.99% 35-54 12.46% 24.43% 7.38% 15.35% 12.76% 10.67% 16.95% 55+ 10.56% 22.21% 5.98% 10.86% 14.64% 12.35% 23.41% Adults 55 and over, on the other hand, have the highest percentage of respondents who have saved 300,000 or more — 23 percent. However, about one-third have less than 10,000 saved. That means these baby boomers need to catch up on retirement savings if they won’t have other sources of retirement income beyond Social Security. Americans Say They Don’t Make Enough to Save Money for Retirement To find out why Americans aren’t saving, GOBankingRates conducted a separate survey through Survata. We asked more than 1,000 adults with 0 saved, “Which is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?” Respondents could choose one of the following responses: – I don’t make enough money to save – I won’t need retirement savings – I’m prioritizing paying down debt – Job doesn’t offer a plan – Struggling to pay bills – Used money for an emergency The most common reason respondents gave for not saving for retirement was “I don’t make enough money.” About 40 percent chose this response. The second-most common reason for not saving was “I’m struggling to pay bills,” with about 25 percent of respondents choosing this answer. About 10 percent of respondents said they wouldn’t need retirement savings, they used their savings for an emergency and their job doesn’t offer a retirement plan. The least common reason for not saving for retirement was prioritizing paying down debt. Meanwhile, women are more likely than men to say that they aren’t saving for retirement because they don’t make enough money — 43 percent versus 36 percent. This helps explain the gap in retirement savings between women and men that our other survey found. Women also are more likely than men to say that they aren’t saving for retirement because they’re struggling to pay bills — 27 percent versus 23 percent. However, they are less likely than men to say that they won’t need retirement savings, that their job doesn’t offer a retirement plan or that they had used the money for an emergency.

Baby boomers ages 55 to 64 are more likely than other age groups to say they aren’t saving because they are struggling to pay bills, with 27 percent of respondents in this age group choosing this answer. Gen Xers ages 35 to 44 are more likely than other age groups to say they’re not saving because they won’t need retirement savings. And adults 65 and older are the most likely to say they don’t have retirement savings because they used the money for an emergency. Q: Which is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?

Plus, the percentage of Americans with bigger savings account balances has grown: – 13 percent have 50,000 to 99,999 saved in 2018 compared with 8 percent in 2017 and 2016. – 12 percent have 100,000 to 199,999 saved versus 7 percent in 2017 and 8 percent in 2016. – 10 percent have 200,000 to 299,999 saved compared with 5 percent in 2017 and 2016. – 16 percent have 300,000 or more saved versus 14 percent in 2017 and 13 percent in 2016. Take Steps Now to Have a Golden Retirement Later If you have little to no retirement savings, one of the best ways to save more for retirement is to calculate how much you need. You might not be making retirement savings a priority because you don’t realize how much a comfortable retirement will cost you. You can find free retirement calculators on the websites of investment firms such as Fidelity and Vanguard. If you have a retirement plan at work, the plan administrator might even offer a retirement calculator. Financial planners typically recommend saving 10 percent to 15 percent of your income annually to save enough for a comfortable retirement. If you’re not setting aside this much, review your spending to see what nonessential expenses can be cut so you can boost retirement contributions. And don’t forget to increase contributions with each pay raise. If you don’t have a workplace retirement plan, you can open an IRA or Roth IRA through an investment firm such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price or Vanguard. If you’re self-employed, you can save for retirement with a SEP or solo 401k, which also can be opened at an investment firm. But if you’re already close to retirement age and don’t have much saved, you can stretch your retirement savings by working longer. Other options include getting a part-time job in retirement or relocating to a place with a lower cost of living — perhaps even outside the U.S. Up Next: How Long 1 Million Will Last in Every State Methodology: The GOBankingRates survey posed the question, “By your best estimate, how much money do you have saved for retirement?” Respondents could select one of the following answer options: 1) “Less than 10,000”; 2) “10,000 to 49,999”; 3) “50,000 to 99,999”; 4) “100,000 to 199,999”; 5) “200,000 to 299,999”; 6) “300,000 or more”; or 7) “0.” Responses were collected through three separate Google Consumer Surveys conducted Feb. 6-9, 2018, and responses are representative of the U.S. online population. Each survey targeted one of three age groups: 1) ages 18 to 34, 1,001 respondents; 2) ages 35 to 54, 1,001 respondents; and 3) age 55 and over, 1,003 respondents. An additional survey was conducted to target people who have no retirement savings and find out why. A screener question was used to collect responses only from 1,000 respondents who said they do not have retirement savings. Respondents were then asked, “Which of the following is the main reason you do not have any retirement savings?” Respondents could select one of the following answer options: 1) “I don’t make enough money to save”; 2) “I won’t need retirement savings”; 3) “I’m prioritizing paying down debt”; 4) “Job doesn’t offer a plan”; 5) “Struggling to pay bills”; or 6) “Used money for an emergency.” Responses were collected by a survey conducted Feb. 6-9, 2018, using Survata. Survata categorizes the ages of their respondents in the following groups: 1) 25 to 34, 2) 35 to 44, 3) 45 to 54, 4) 55 to 64, 5) 65 and over. ||||| The golden years are likely to be tarnished for nearly half the country. A new survey from GoBankingRates finds that 42% of Americans have saved 10,000 or less for retirement, while 14% have absolutely no money put away. It gets even worse for millennials. Nearly 19% of people between 18-34 have yet to save a single dollar for retirement, according to the site. The study of more than 1,000 adults found that the top reason for the paltry savings numbers was they simply didn’t earn enough to put money away. On the positive side, some 16% of the people surveyed said they have 300,000 or more set aside for retirement. And 10% say they have between 200,000 and 300,000. Men are more likely than women to have larger retirement account balances, the site found. Forty-five percent of women have no savings or 10,000 or less, versus 40% of men. That’s better than the past two years, though. In 2017, 58% of women had either no savings or less than 10,000. The previous year, that number was 63%. |||||","completion":"A survey has found that many people in America haven't saved enough for their retirement. The website GoBankingRates.com discovered that 42% of Americans they asked have saved less than 10,000 for their retirement. In fact, 14% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, while 28% have less than 10,000 saved. The younger generation, known as millennials, were even less prepared. Nearly 60% of them have almost nothing saved for their old age. However, the results do show an improvement compared to last year's survey, where 55% of people had under 10,000 saved. One of the reasons people struggle to save is that they're unaware of options like individual retirement plans or 401k options at work. Remember, even small contributions to your retirement fund can add up over time, so it's important to start saving early."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house.

The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, we can determine which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence. Step 1: Identify the group with mutations In this case, Group L has displayed all kinds of mutations while Group D did not. Step 2: Understand the relation between mutations and RNA sequences A mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. Mutations can occur in both germline and somatic cells. Germline mutations can be passed down to the next generation, whereas somatic mutations are limited to an individual organism's body cells and do not affect their offspring. Step 3: Associate the presence of mutations with changes in RNA sequences Since mutations are changes in the DNA or RNA sequences, the group with more mutations will have more changes in their RNA sequences. Based on these steps, Group L, which displayed all kinds of mutations, had more changes in their RNA sequence compared to Group D, which did not display any mutations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: When one person gains weight, their close friends often follow. Researchers have just offered evidence in a study that says obesity appears to spread through society. But the findings might also offer hope. If friends help make obesity acceptable, then they might also be influential in losing the fat. The researchers note that support groups are already an effective tool in dealing with other socially influenced problems, like alcoholism . The findings appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers used information collected from 12,000 people. It was collected between 1972 and 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The information was highly detailed. There was even contact information for close friends of the people in the study. The researchers examined more than 40,000 social ties. They found a person's chances of becoming severely overweight increased by 50% if a friend had become obese. A sister or brother of a person who became obese had a 40% increased chance of becoming obese. The risk for a wife or husband was a little less than that. Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School was a lead researcher in the study. He says there is a direct causal relationship between a person getting fat and being followed in weight gain by a friend. The study found that the sex of the friends was also an influence. In same-sex friendship, a person had a 71% increased risk of becoming obese. Men had a 44% increased risk of becoming obese after weight gain in a brother. In sisters, it was 67%. The researchers also considered the effect of where people lived in relation to each other. James Fowler of the University of California was the other lead expert. He says a friend who lives a few hundred kilometers away has as much influence as one in the same neighborhood. He says the study demonstrates the need to consider that a major part of people's health is tied to their social connections. Both researchers say their research shows that obesity is not just a private medical issue, but also a...

In 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, Lin Zexu, to curb smuggling. This resulted in the First Opium War (1839–42). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia.

At the time of the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that \\"It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We can do better than that.'\\"In 1992, current guitarist Darren Middleton was invited to join Powderfinger by Fanning and Haug, after they were impressed by his work in Brisbane band Pirate. Middleton accepted the offer and became the fifth member, joining Jon Coghill who had replaced Bishop as drummer. The line-up of Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, and Coghill then remained unchanged.Throughout the late 1990s, Powderfinger rose to prominence throughout Australia, receiving several accolades and achieving highly successful record and concert ticket sales. As the most vocal and prominent member of the band, the popularity for the group elevated Fanning as a powerful individual in the public view of the Australian music industry.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: Who said the national guard will help with border surveillance?

OPTIONS: (1). negative (2). positive","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence is negative, which corresponds to option (1).

The use of the word \\"poor\\" helps depict a disappointing scenario. 2. \\"that is really funny\\": This part of the sentence emphasizes that the lack of meaningful content or material makes it difficult for the actor to create humor or entertainment value, further enhancing the negative sentiment. 3. \\"and then expects us to laugh\\": This phrase portrays dissatisfaction or irritation on the part of the speaker, expressing the expectation others have of deriving enjoyment from something that doesn't seem entertaining. 4. \\"because he acts so goofy all the time\\": The final portion of the sentence describes the actor's behavior as \\"goofy,\\" which is generally an unfavorable adjective, and indicates that this constant goofiness is not enough to be considered funny, creating a negative impression of the situation. Taking these elements into account, it becomes clear that the sentiment of the sentence is indeed negative, with a focus on the lack of humor or entertainment value despite the involved talents of the subject, Dana Carvey.

Amtrak Northeast Corridor service between New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, continued to be affected by ongoing signal problems Wednesday in New Jersey, Amtrak said in a 10 a.m. statement. In addition, while New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor service improved as the morning progressed, the line was still suffering delays into the afternoon, the railroad's website said in a 12:24 p.m. update. The outage was caused by a downed tree that fell into the overhead wire system near Hamilton, New Jersey, Amtrak said. As a result, Amtrak trains were moving at greatly reduced speeds, with some trains canceled due to associated congestion. Amtrak said its personnel were working to repair the problem, but passengers should expect westbound/southbound delays of 90 to 120 minutes and 60 to 90 minute eastbound/northbound delays. No trains were stranded between stations, and passengers were being re-accommodated on other trains where available, Amtrak said. Amtrak spokesman Cliff Cole couldn't say how long trains would be traveling with reduced speed and frequency before service would be completely restored. New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor service between New Brunswick, New Jersey, and New York was back on schedule or close to on schedule in both directions, according to the transit website. However, 30- to 45-minute delays plagued the Northeast Corridor line into the afternoon because of signal problems, the website said. Service was suspended most of the morning in both directions between Trenton, New Jersey, and New Brunswick, because of the signal problems. Passengers were advised to get on the 11:17 a.m. train departing from Trenton. Transit and suburban buses were accepting rail tickets and passes for fares Wednesday morning, the website said.

In this sentence, it is stated that Moore was first released by the Chicago Bears on July 31, 2015. Then, after some time had passed, the Chicago Bears decided to re-sign him on September 5, 2015. This implies that there was a gap in his time affiliated with the team during which he was not a part of the Chicago Bears. 2.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The archbishop of Uppsala (spelled Upsala until the early 20th century) has been the primate in Sweden in an unbroken succession since 1164, first during the Catholic era, and from the 1530s and onward under the Lutheran church. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe.

Read this article and answer this question In 1572, the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time the largest and one of the most populous states in Europe, was vacated when King Sigismund II of Poland died without heirs. The Sejm was given the power to elect a new king, and in the Polish-Lithuanian royal election, 1573 chose Henry of France; Henry soon ascended the French throne and forfeited the Polish one by returning to France. Báthory decided to enter into the election; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania, which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of Sinpaul. On 12 December 1575, after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years, primate of Poland Jakub Uchański, representing a pro-Habsburg faction, declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch. However, chancellor Jan Zamoyski and other opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king, a Polish king. After a heated discussion, it was decided that Anna Jagiellon, sister of the former King Sigismund II Augustus, should be elected King of Poland and marry Stephen Báthory. In January 1576 Báthory passed the mantle of Voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland. On 1 May 1576 Báthory married Anna and was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.

The founder of a chain of academies who raised funds for the Archbishop of Canterbury has been investigated over ‘highly unusual’ payments. Officials highlighted a series of dubious financial practices at 16 schools set up by Sir Ewan Harper in the Education Fellowship Trust. These included £90,000 paid to himself and £28,000 to his wife Jane. Department for Education officials who investigated the group of 16 academies - the Education Fellowship Trust (EFT) - also criticised £45,000 expenses awarded in a year to just two governors, a £20,000 fact-finding trip to New York and excessive spending on hotels, meals and alcoholic drinks. Dubious: Payments from the Education Fellowship Trust included £28,000 in rent of office space in Titchmarsh, near Kettering, (pictured) to the wife of founder Sir Ewan Harper. Further concerns were raised over family members being given unadvertised jobs - including a director of communications on £70,000-a-year - while £1,000 was spent on Christmas cards and £630 on customised umbrellas. The EFT admitted that wine was purchased for a workshop with head teachers - as part of a training exercise designed to show that children, like grapes, can mature into ‘exceptional wines’ given the right nurturing or merely end up as ‘plonk’. Sir Ewan’s links both to education and the Church of England stretch back decades. He was tutored at Cambridge by Robert Runcie, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 1980s, he helped set up the Lambeth Fund, which raises funds to support past and present Archbishops of Canterbury. Marlborough-educated Sir Ewan, 74, was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by another former Archbishop, George Carey. Commended: Sir Ewan Harper was knighted in 2003 for services to the Church of England, having been recommended by former Archbishop, George Carey (pictured) Before founding the EFT, he led the United Learning Trust - one of the biggest backers of academy and independent schools in the country. A former businessman, he ran the family’s export firm, which he later sold. Sir Ewan became chairman of the Lambeth Fund in 2011 but retired in March. The EFT said he had also now retired from the trust. Officials from the DfE’s Education Funding Agency probed financial practices at the EFT after a review of 2012/13 accounts highlighted ‘highly unusual’ payments. These included nearly £28,000 in rent and insurance premiums to Lady Jane Harper, who is listed as owning cottages which the trust uses as an office. In a report, the agency said there was evidence ‘that the lease rental was a fair market price from an estate agent’ and that alternative premises were checked. ‘However there was no documented evidence provided to record the outcome of the inspections or the basis for the final decision to lease the current accommodation,’ it said. Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the two grade II listed stone cottages with thatched roofs under Lady Jane Harper’s name were leased to the EFT after failed attempts to find a private residential tenant. Official documents from East Northamptonshire Council show they were used by the United Learning Trust - the schools chain Sir Ewan previously headed - until it moved to larger premises. Internal changes were made to make it suitable for residential use and it was put on the market through a letting agent in September 2011. The council documents state: ‘As of 16th December no tenant had been found. ‘The applicant’s husband discovered the need to use the building as an office once again for his personal business.’ Another cottage in the same lane in the picture postcard village of Titchmarsh, near Kettering, is registered to Lady Jane Harper. All the properties are next to the couple’s home, which is in both their names and was valued at £1 million in 2010. It is hidden at the end of a long gravel driveway and is set in extensive landscaped grounds with a swimming pool. A woman who answered the door of the cottages said they were still being used by the EFT. The Government probe also raised concerns about £90,000 awarded to Sir Ewan as chairman of the trust - as well as ‘transactions with companies in which the chairman has a controlling interest’. The trust said £90,000 was paid to Sir Ewan because he was also chief executive at the time. But the investigation found that Sir Ewan was forbidden from holding both roles under trust rules. The trust, which has a turnover of £10million per year and lists 16 member schools on its website, was found to have committed ‘significant breaches of the Companies Act 2006, Charity Commission regulations and the Academies Financial Handbook’. A report on the findings, which is redacted in places, makes 26 separate recommendations. It highlights a series of questionable uses of public money including a £20,000 trip to New York by a group of heads. The report said it may not have been ‘the best use of public funds’. Expenses exposed: The Education Fellowship Trust runs a chain of 16 academies (stock image) Two governors ‘claimed £45,000 in expenses and other supplies and services’ while one academy in the group suffered a £38,000 fraud because IT security software was not up-to-date, enabling a transfer out of its bank account. The money is reportedly being reimbursed by the bank. The report also highlights that expenses policy allowed for ‘moderate consumption of alcohol’ - even though alcohol spending is considered an ‘improper use of public funds’. ‘A number of claims were made that included the purchase of alcohol,’ the report said. Meals and hotels were also claimed ‘in excess of the staff expenses policy’. Concern was also raised over unadvertised posts for family members. ‘We found that a number of the appointed head office staff were family members of either trustees or senior members of staff,’ said the report. There had been no ‘competition or advertising’ of the posts, which included a director of communication at a salary of £70,000 per year plus benefits. Meanwhile a finance manager had been appointed on £100 an hour with no formal tender for the work. It was ‘questionable’ whether this was value for money, said the report. More than half of secondary schools - and growing numbers of primaries - now have academy status which allows them to operate outside local council control. But there have been a series of financial scandals involving some of the groups which run academies, leading to calls for tighter controls. The agency issued the trust with a financial notice to improve.

We have issued the Trust with a Financial Notice to Improve and if they do not take the necessary steps, we will not hesitate to take further action. ‘Academies operate under a strict system of oversight and accountability - more robust than in council-run schools - which means any issues are identified and that we can take swift action to address them.’","completion":"The founder of a chain of academies, Sir Ewan Harper, has been investigated for \\"highly unusual\\" payments in the Education Fellowship Trust.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the people of an Eskimo village spot the mantis in the sky, and although they hurry to their boats to escape, it swoops down and kills several men.

It seems to be a statement of support, indicating that this person will continue to support their 'hero' regardless of criticism or negative attacks. 2. Now, let's break down the sentence for translation starting with the phrase 'And this person'. In Czech, this translates to 'A tato osoba'. 3. 'For one' is a phrase usually utilized in English, indicating a sense of breaking down count or emphasizing an individual opinion. In Czech, we can use 'alespoň jedna' to reflect this sense. 4. Using 'is gonna' to say 'will' in English is informal. To make the sentence more standard Czech, I opted for 'bude', the future tense of the verb 'to be'. 5. The phrase 'stand by her hero' in Czech could be translated as 'stát po boku svého hrdiny'. In Czech, we use 'po boku' to indicate the English equivalent of 'stand by'. 6. 'No matter how much' can be translated as 'bez ohledu na to, kolik'. 7. 'Mud they sling' is an English idiom, suggesting criticism or negative attacks. The closest equivalent in Czech could be 'bahna na něho hodí' which literally means 'mud they throw at him'.

Although there was a good reason for Sam's a being late--serious illness at home--he decided that this by-now-familiar excuse wouldn't work any longer. His supervisor was probably already pacing up and down preparing a dismissal speech. Yes, the boss was, Sam entered the office at 9:35. The place was as quiet as a locker room ; everyone was hard at work. Sam's supervisor came up to him. Suddenly, Sam forced a grin and stretched out his hand. \\"How do you do!\\" he said. \\"I'm Sam Maynard. I'm applying for a job. Which, I understand, became available just 35 minutes ago.

At all. \\"During pregnancy: no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; [and] all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk,\\" the study states. That's because, researchers explain in a press release, alcohol intake while pregnant can result in a wide array of problems from growth retardation to developmental delays and learning disabilities to problems with the brain, heart, bones and spine, kidneys, vision, or hearing. Dr. Janet F. Williams, one of the lead researchers, tells Live Science that much attention is paid to fetal alcohol syndrome—but even if your child doesn't get that, he hasn't necessarily escaped scot-free. In fact, there are any number of so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that are linked to drinking while pregnant, and any time a child experiences a delay or a behavioral disorder, she explains, an FASD could be to blame—but FASDs are more difficult to diagnose than FAS. The new study points out that more than three decades of research links alcohol intake while pregnant with birth defects, she says, far more than any evidence suggesting it's no big deal. The bottom line, she says: \\"No alcohol use during pregnancy guarantees that fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will not occur.\\" (But at least you don't have to worry too much about drinking while breastfeeding.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. Doctors and researchers have been looking into whether it's safe for pregnant women to drink any alcohol. They want to make sure that the babies growing inside their mommies stay healthy and strong. After lots of studying, the big doctor group called the American Academy of Pediatrics says that pregnant women should not drink any alcohol at all. It doesn't matter if it's just a little bit, or which kind of alcoholic drink it is – it's all risky for the baby. Drinking alcohol when pregnant can cause problems for the baby, like growing too slow, having a hard time learning things, or having issues with their body parts like their brain, heart, and bones. Even if a child looks okay when they're born, they might have problems later in life because of their mommy drinking alcohol during pregnancy. So, to make sure babies stay healthy and don't have these problems, mommies should not drink alcohol while they're pregnant. That way, both the mommy and the baby can be strong and happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Article: Objects Spotted by Satellite Are 'Best Lead' in Malaysia Airlines Search Search crews were scouring the southern Indian Ocean today after two objects that may be related to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight were spotted by satellite, officials said today. Officials described the sighting as the \\"best lead we have right now\\" and said four aircraft and an Australian Navy ship were sent to the region off the coast of Australia. In addition, a Norwegian car carrier, the Hoegh St. Petersburg, was diverted into the search area which is searching through the night using lights and binocular. WATCH: New Satellite Images Reveal Possible Objects in Indian Ocean A U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon search plane is involved with the search, occurring about 1,500 miles off of Australia's coast. ABC News was on board the flight today. EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: David Wright Aboard Navy Search and Rescue Plane Australia's government released satellite images of the possible objects today. JUST IN: Australia's AMSA shares new satellite images of unidentified objects - Object Number 1: pic.twitter.com/u2nMjrgtrJ — ABC News (@ABC) March 20, 2014 JUST IN: Australia's AMSA shares new satellite images of unidentified objects - Object Number 2: pic.twitter.com/XdRTvgFOYX — ABC News (@ABC) March 20, 2014 The updates have been deemed \\"credible enough to divert resources to this area,\\" said John Young with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Emergency Response Division. The largest of the objects spotted on satellite was about 78 feet long, he said. \\"This is a lead. It is probably the best lead we have right now,\\" Young said. News of the find prompted Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott to call Malaysia's Prime Minister Dato’ Seri Najib Razak to inform him of the development. Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur this morning, \\"Today what I’m comfortable with saying is at least there is a credible lead… That gives us hope. As long as there’s hope, we will continue… To be fair to the families, we must also show we will never, never give up hope.” The news provided little comfort to the families of the plane's passengers. “The one piece of information they want is information we don’t have, is the location of MH370,” Hishammuddin said. Despite the development, officials were stressing caution, saying the objects will be difficult to find in the vast Indian Ocean and might not be related to Flight 370. Clouds and rain have limited visibility for today's search efforts, officials said. The Navy's P-8 and a P-3 search plane with the Royal Australian Air Force were both unable to locate any debris today, but other aircraft from Australia and New Zealand were continuing the hunt. Earlier, American and British aviation officials refined satellite signals from the missing plane, creating two possible flight paths that dramatically narrowed the scope of the search. The plane was carrying 239 people when it disappeared on March 8. ||||| Story highlights Australian Prime Minister says two objects are seen in the southern Indian Ocean An Australian air force plane is attempting a closer inspection, Australian media report President Barack Obama says search for Flight 370 is ''a top priority'' No information of significance has so far been found on any passengers, authorities say Authorities have spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that are possibly related to the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Thursday. \\"New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,\\" Abbott said in the the Australian House of Representatives in Canberra. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has received information based on satellite imagery of objects possibly related to the search. \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified,\\" he said. \\"I can inform the House that a Royal Australian Air Force Orion has been diverted to attempt to locate the objects.\\" Three other planes will carry out a \\"more intensive follow-up search,\\" he said. Australian search teams have been at the forefront of the hunt for the missing plane in the remote southern Indian Ocean. The announcement from Abbott raises hopes of finding parts of the plane after a huge search that is now in its 13th day. Previous reports of debris found in the sea have not turned out to be related to the passenger jet, which vanished over Southeast Asia earlier this month. But those reports came before the search area was massively expanded into two large arcs, one that heads northwest into Asia, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The Malaysian military is checking the new information from Australian authorities, a source close to the investigation told CNN. \\"Verification might take some time. It is very far and it will take some time to locate and verify the objects,\\" the source said. Malaysia's Acting Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein said Abbott had informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak of the development Thursday. \\"At this stage, Australian officials have yet to establish whether these objects are indeed related to the search for MH370,\\" Hishammuddin said. Other pieces of information related to the investigation into the plane's disappearance had emerged Wednesday. Flight simulator probed Investigators looking at the flight simulator taken from the home of Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the plane, have discovered that some data had been deleted from it, Hishammuddin said at a news conference. What the revelation means is unclear. It could be another dead end in an investigation that has been full of them so far, or it could provide further evidence for the theory that one or more of the flight crew may have been involved in the plane's disappearance 12 days ago. \\"It may not tell us anything. It's a step in the process,\\" one U.S. law enforcement source told CNN. \\"It could be a very insignificant detail in the process.\\" Investigators have been looking into the background of all 239 passengers and crew members aboard the plane that vanished in the early morning hours of March 8 while en route from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Particular attention has focused on the pilot and first officer on Flight 370, but authorities have yet to come up with any evidence explaining why either of them would have taken the jetliner off course. Hishammuddin didn't say what had been deleted, but simulation programs can store data from previous sessions for later playback. He also did not say who might have deleted the data. FBI examination Specialists are examining the simulator in hopes of recovering the data that was deleted, Hishammuddin said.

The FBI examination of the computer drives involves sorting through a large volume of data, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation. \\"It is going to take some period of time, but we are analyzing it with a great degree of urgency. It is prioritized right at the top because the world is trying to figure this out,\\" the official said on condition of anonymity. Deleted files from Shah's simulator could reveal it had been used to practice diverting the plane and flying it to an unfamiliar airport, experts said. But even if investigators retrieve past simulations showing that Zaharie practiced flying to seemingly odd locations, that doesn't necessarily indicate evidence of anything nefarious, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. \\"You put in strange airports and try to land there, just to see if you can do it,\\" said Schiavo, adding that she sometimes does just that on the flight simulation program on her home computer. 'Grasping at straws' President Barack Obama called the search for Flight 370 \\"a top priority,\\" telling KDFW of Dallas on Wednesday that the United States will keep working on it. \\"We have put every resource that we have available at the disposal of the search process,\\" he said. But beyond help with the computer drives, the Malaysian government has not put in a formal request for additional FBI help overseas, according to the senior U.S. official. \\"We have made it clear we are ready to provide help whenever they need it,\\" the official said. \\"We are grasping at straws. No one is running on anything white hot.\\" More than 60 ships and 50 aircraft are participating in the search. But at least two aircraft, a Japanese search plane and a U.S. Navy P-3 Orion, sat on a runway at a Subang air base this week after Indonesia refused to allow the planes to fly through its airspace. \\"From what I understand, this is an international operation,\\" Cmdr. William Marks, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN by telephone. \\"...I'm confident we're going to be flying today or very soon.\\" Later, Indonesia's military spokesman told CNN clearance was given to all search planes. Although the search area spans nearly 3 million square miles, a U.S. government official familiar with the investigation said the missing plane is most likely somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. \\"This is an area out of normal shipping lanes, out of any commercial flight patterns, with few fishing boats, and there are no islands,\\" the official said, warning that the search could well last \\"weeks and not days.\\" Angry families want answers The lack of progress has angered and frustrated families, who have accused Malaysian officials of withholding information. Some family members staged a protest at the Kuala Lumpur hotel where media covering the search are staying. Their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters, dragging one as she screamed.

They gather daily for a briefing with officials. Ye Lun, whose brother-in-law is on the missing plane, says every day is the same. He and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing, and that's it. They go back to the hotel to watch the news on television. In a statement, Hishammuddin said Malaysian authorities \\"regret the scenes at this afternoon's press conference.\\" \\"One can only imagine the anguish they are going through,\\" he said of the families. \\"Malaysia is doing everything in its power to find MH370 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing.\\" An abrupt change in direction The disappearance continues to intrigue the public and frustrate officials, who have turned up no sign of the plane despite the involvement of teams from 26 nations. On Tuesday, a law enforcement official told CNN that the aircraft's first major change of course -- an abrupt westward turn that took the plane off its route to China and back across the Malay Peninsula -- was almost certainly programmed by somebody in the cockpit. The change was entered into the plane's system at least 12 minutes before a person in the cockpit, believed to be the co-pilot, signed off to air traffic controllers. Two minutes after the signoff, the plane's transponder stopped communicating details about the plane's altitude, speed and heading. Some experts said the change in direction could have been part of an alternate flight plan programmed in advance in case of emergency; others suggested it could show something more nefarious was afoot. But Hishammuddin said Wednesday that \\"there is no additional waypoint on MH370's documented flight plan, which depicts normal routing all the way to Beijing.\\" The Thai military, meanwhile, said it had spotted the plane turning west toward the Strait of Malacca early on March 8. That supports the analysis of Malaysian military radar that has the plane flying out over the Strait of Malacca and into the Indian Ocean. But it didn't make it any clearer where the plane went next. Authorities say information from satellites suggests the plane kept flying for about six hours after it was last detected by Malaysian military radar. Malaysian authorities, who are coordinating the search, say the available evidence suggests the missing plane flew off course in a deliberate act by someone who knew what they were doing.

So far, no information of significance has been found about any passengers, Hishammuddin said. China says it has found nothing suspicious during background checks on its citizens on the flight -- a large majority of the plane's passengers. And some experts have warned against hastily jumping to conclusions about the role of the pilots. \\"I've worked on many cases were the pilots were suspect, and it turned out to be a mechanical and horrible problem,\\" said Schiavo. \\"And I have a saying myself: Sometimes, an erratic flight path is heroism, not terrorism.\\" Ticking clock Searchers are racing the clock in their efforts to find the plane and its flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders. The devices have batteries designed to send out pings for 30 days. That leaves 18 days until the batteries are expected to run out. The task is being complicated by the scope of the search area, as well as the depth of some of the waters being searched -- up to 23,000 feet (7,000 meters). Searchers trying to find and retrieve wreckage and bodies from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, had to use unmanned submarines. It took nearly two years to find the bulk of the wreckage, including the flight data recorders, in waters nearly 12,000 feet deep. It took even longer to determine what happened to the plane. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amsa's John Young said the objects spotted were a \\"reasonable size\\" Australia is investigating two objects seen on satellite images that could potentially be linked to the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, officials say. A Norwegian ship joined planes from Australia, New Zealand and the US in searching the area 2,500km (1,550 miles) from Perth. As night fell, the air search ended for the day, with teams saying bad weather conditions had hampered their efforts. Flight MH370 was carrying 239 people when it disappeared on 8 March. It was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it lost contact with air traffic controllers and disappeared from radar. At a news conference on Thursday, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the possible sighting of debris on satellite images as a \\"credible lead\\".

A number of sightings of possible debris have been investigated since the plane went missing but so far none have proved to be linked. Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the latest discovery based on satellite images taken on 16 March. \\"The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) has received information based on satellite information of objects possibly related to the search,\\" Mr Abbott told parliament. \\"Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified.\\" Image copyright Amsa Image caption Australian authorities said one of the objects was 24m in size Image copyright Amsa Image caption The objects were seen on satellite images and assessed by experts Image copyright AFP Image caption The St Petersburg, a Norwegian merchant ship, was the first vessel to reach the area Two Australian Orion aircraft searching the area on Thursday were joined later by aircraft from the US and New Zealand. Amsa said the aircraft had covered an area of 23,000km² (14,000 square miles) but confirmed that they had found no debris. It said the search would resume on Friday. The captain of the first Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane to return from the search area described the weather conditions as \\"extremely bad\\" with rough seas and high winds. David Wright, an ABC News reporter who was on the P-8 Poseidon, said all the sophisticated plane had spotted was \\"a freighter and two pods of dolphins\\". A Norwegian merchant ship, the St Petersburg, has also arrived in the area after responding to a shipping broadcast issued by Australia's rescue co-ordination centre. It will be joined by an Australian naval vessel, HMAS Success, which is on its way to help with the search and Britain has also deployed HMS Echo, a coastal survey ship, to aid the operation.

The largest object appeared to be about 24m (78ft) in size, he said. At the scene The relatives of Chinese passengers on board MH370 watched the announcements from Australia on monitors set up at the Beijing hotel where they have been waiting for the past 13 days. When the press briefings were over, the families left the room. Most refused to speak to journalists, though one man told the BBC: \\"I don't believe any of this. I think my son is still alive.\\" Another relative, the son of a famed calligrapher on the plane, explained to us the families' reluctance to accept the possibility the plane had crashed. \\"If the Australian findings really turn out to be the remains of the plane, that would mean there is no hope left for us.\\" \\"This is a lead, it is probably the best lead we have right now. But we need to get there, find them, see them, assess them, to know whether it's really meaningful or not.\\" He warned the objects spotted in the sea could turn out to be unrelated to MH370, such as containers that had fallen from ships. \\"On this particular occasion the size and the fact that there are multiple [objects] located in the same area really makes it worth looking at,\\" Mr Young added. Michael Daniel, a former US Federal Aviation Administration official, told Singapore's Straits Times: \\"If they have a strong feeling or indication that the debris belongs to the aircraft, one of the first things authorities will do is drop sonar buoys in the water. \\"If the black box is there, the buoys should be able to pick up the signals. This could take up to 48 hours but it all depends on how near or far the ships and other assets are.\\" Australia informed Malaysian authorities of the development on Thursday morning.

This was based on its last faint signal to a satellite - an hourly \\"handshake\\" broadcast even when the main communication systems are switched off. Malaysia says search efforts are continuing in both corridors, involving a total of 18 ships, 29 aircraft and 6 ship-borne helicopters. Meanwhile, relatives of those on board are still waiting for concrete news.

A vintage motorcycle: A vintage motorcycle typically runs on gasoline, as alternative fuel technologies were not widely available when these motorcycles were manufactured. The design and engineering of vintage motorcycles are mainly geared towards the utilization of gasoline as their primary fuel source, and thus they are unlikely to use an alternative fuel without undergoing extensive modifications. b. An older car: Similar to vintage motorcycles, older cars were primarily designed to run on gasoline. The required technology and widespread adaptation of alternative fuels were lacking when these older cars were produced. While it is possible to convert an older car to run on alternative fuels like biodiesel or ethanol, the majority of older cars still run on gasoline. Consequently, older cars are less likely to use an alternative fuel. c. An 1800's train: Most trains from the 1800s were steam-powered, which primarily relied on coal or wood for fuel. While coal and wood are not gasoline, they are not considered alternative fuels according to modern standards. Alternative fuels usually refer to cleaner and renewable energy sources like electricity, hydrogen, or biofuels which were not in use for trains during the 1800s. Therefore, an 1800s train does not use an alternative fuel as defined today. d. A modern bus: Modern buses are more likely to make use of alternative fuels compared to the other options listed above. As the world moves toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, there has been a considerable push for public transportation systems to adopt alternative fuels. Modern buses are often powered by electricity, natural gas, biodiesel, or hydrogen fuel cells. Depending on location and regulations, some cities have even mandated the use of alternative fuels for public transportation to decrease emissions and reduce environmental impact. Based on the analysis provided for each option, the most suitable answer to the question, \\"Which of the following likely uses an alternative fuel?\\" would be: d. A modern bus Modern buses have a higher likelihood of using alternative fuels due to increased awareness about environmental sustainability and technological advancement. They represent a shift away from dependency on gasoline, and many public transportation systems specifically promote the use of buses that operate on clean and renewable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Upon exposure, the amount of light energy that reaches the film determines the effect upon the emulsion. If the brightness of the light is multiplied by a factor and the exposure of the film decreased by the same factor by varying the camera's shutter speed and aperture, so that the energy received is the same, the film will be developed to the same density. This rule is called reciprocity. The systems for determining the sensitivity for an emulsion are possible because reciprocity holds. In practice, reciprocity works reasonably well for normal photographic films for the range of exposures between 1/1000 second to 1/2 second. However, this relationship breaks down outside these limits, a phenomenon known as reciprocity failure. How is the brightness of a light changed? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The brightness of a light can be changed by varying several factors, both in the light source itself and in the environment where the light is being emitted. Here are some ways in which the brightness of a light can be altered: 1. Intensity of the light source: By increasing or decreasing the power supplied to a light source, its intensity can be changed. For example, a dimmable LED light bulb can be adjusted to different brightness levels by changing the amount of electrical power it receives. 2. Distance from the light source: The brightness of a light also depends on the distance between the light source and the illuminated object or surface. According to the inverse square law, the intensity of light diminishes with the square of the distance from the source. This means that an object placed twice as far away from a light source will receive only one-fourth of the illumination. 3. Angle of incidence: The angle at which light strikes a surface can also affect its apparent brightness. A light source shining directly on a surface (at a 90-degree angle) will appear at its brightest, while lights hitting the surface at more oblique angles will appear less bright due to reflection and scattering. 4. Diffusion and reflection: Diffusion can be used to soften and spread light, reducing harsh shadows and creating a more even distribution of brightness. Reflectors can bounce light toward or away from specific areas, also enabling control over brightness levels. 5. Environmental factors: The brightness of light can also be affected by environmental factors such as the presence of dust, fog, or haze. These can scatter and absorb light, ultimately reducing the perceived brightness. 6. Contrast with surroundings: The brightness of a light source can also be perceived in relation to the overall ambient lighting in the environment. A light source will appear brighter in the dark surroundings as compared to a well-lit environment. By controlling these factors, the brightness of a light can be effectively adjusted, allowing for a variety of creative and practical applications in photography, film, and other visual arts."},{"prompt":"Question: What do people who are construction workers do?

Find two strong trees: Look for two trees that are about the same height and close enough that your hammock can stretch between them. Make sure there are no sharp branches or anything that could hurt you. 2. Measure the distance: Make sure the trees are not too close or too far apart. The distance should be around 10 to 15 feet (about 3 to 5 big steps) for most hammocks. 3. Get strong ropes: You need some rope or straps to tie the hammock to the trees. Make sure they are strong and long enough to go around the trees. 4. Tie the ropes: Wrap the rope or strap around each tree trunk, about 4-5 feet high from the ground. Tie a strong and safe knot, like a bowline knot or a figure-eight loop. 5. Attach the hammock: Take the ends of your hammock and hook them to the ropes or straps on each tree. Make sure everything feels secure, and the hammock is not too tight or too loose. 6. Test it out: Gently sit on the hammock and see if it holds your weight and feels comfortable. If everything feels good, you're done! Now, you can relax in your hammock between the two trees.

Here are possible answers to this question: - buy a train ticket - create art - apply for job - take care of proposals - stand in line I believe the correct choice is \\"take care of proposals\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"I agree with your choice, and I also believe that the correct answer to the question is \\"take care of proposals.\\" Here's my detailed explanation: The question presents a situation where the boss has provided money to the individual to keep the clients happy or to resolve any discontent among them. Therefore, we can analyze each of the given options to determine which one best fits the given situation. 1. Buy a train ticket: While it is possible that the money could be used to purchase a train ticket, this option does not directly address the clients' concerns or contribute to their satisfaction. Buying a train ticket only allows the individual to travel, and it does not address the clients' needs. Therefore, this option is not the best choice. 2. Create art: Creating art can be a means of expression and relaxation, but it is unlikely to be the primary method that a company would choose for appeasing clients. In a professional context, the needs of clients are usually addressed through meetings, discussions, and well-thought-out proposals that address their requirements and concerns. Hence, this option is also not the best choice. 3. Apply for a job: Applying for a job is unrelated to addressing the concerns of the clients. In the given context, the individual should be focused on keeping the existing clients happy rather than pursuing new job opportunities. As a result, this option is not the right choice. 4. Take care of proposals: In a business context, submitting well-prepared proposals to clients is often an effective way to keep them satisfied and maintain a professional relationship. A proposal can address clients' concerns by providing detailed solutions or plans for their projects or needs. Moreover, the money provided by the boss can be spent on research, development, and presentation of these proposals to ensure their effectiveness. Given this reasoning, \\"take care of proposals\\" is the most logical choice. 5. Stand in line: Standing in line doesn't directly contribute to resolving client concerns or keeping them satisfied. This option is therefore not the best choice in this situation. By analyzing each option, it is clear that the best choice for the individual, who has been given money by their boss to appease clients, is to \\"take care of proposals.\\" This course of action ensures that the clients' concerns and requirements are properly addressed, leading to increased satisfaction and fostering a positive professional relationship between the clients and the company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph : The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. Question: A human who eats an animal that is high on the food chain should take in more or less toxic metals? Answer:","completion":"A human who eats an animal that is high on the food chain should take in more toxic metals. This is because when we consume animals higher up in the food chain, we are indirectly consuming the accumulations of toxic metals present in their bodies, which they have obtained from consuming organisms lower down in the chain. Toxic metals have the tendency to accumulate in living organisms through a process called bioaccumulation. When an organism consumes another organism that contains toxic metals, these metals remain stored in their body tissues, and over time, they can build up to dangerous levels. As we move up the food chain, the concentration of toxic metals tends to increase, which is a phenomenon known as biomagnification. For example, if we consider a simple food chain consisting of plants, herbivores, and carnivores, the plants will absorb a certain amount of toxic metals from the environment. The herbivores will then consume these plants and consequently ingest the toxic metals contained within them. These metals accumulate in the tissues of herbivores, which then becomes a part of their bodies. Next, carnivores, which are the highest within this particular food chain, consume the herbivores, thus taking in even higher concentrations of toxic metals present in the tissues of their prey. Humans, being omnivores, consume both plant-based and animal-based food sources. However, when humans consume animals that are higher on the food chain, they inherit a larger concentration of toxic metals, as they are consuming the accumulated metals stored within the animals' tissues. As a result, by choosing to consume animals higher up in the food chain, humans take in more toxic metals, which can potentially lead to adverse health effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the three people who rent a Madame Pompadour costume? ? Johnny and girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi River riverboat, which also has a casino. Johnny is a compulsive gambler who is down on his luck and in debt. Johnny and his friend Cully, a musician and composer, visit a gypsy camp to get his fortune told. A lady reads tea leaves and tells Johnny that he will soon meet a red-haired woman who will bring him luck. Back on the boat, Johnny and Cully promptly encounter Nellie Bly, their boss Clint Braden's on-again, off-again girlfriend. Nellie has just caught Braden seducing another singer, Mitzi. Since she has red hair, Nellie is persuaded by Johnny to touch his chips for luck. After he wins, Johnny is convinced that the gypsy must be correct. Frankie finds out and becomes jealous, as does Johnny's boss. In a bit of musical theatre, Frankie shoots Johnny for dancing with Nellie Bly while singing Cully's latest song. A Broadway recruiter sees the riverboat show and buys the rights to this new song, suggesting that Frankie and Johnny should work together with him in New York City. Landing in New Orleans, the musical cast and riverboat crew attend a masked ball. Frankie, Nellie and Mitzi all rent the same Madame Pompadour costume. Johnny is eager for the luck of redhead Nellie to win more money, contrary to Frankie's expressed wishes. Being masked and in costume, Frankie and Nellie scheme to switch places to test Johnny's lucky-redhead theory. Johnny wins 10,000 at roulette, but when he kisses the woman he believes to be Nellie, he discovers the switch. Frankie is furious and throws all the winnings out of a window, into the street. Blackie, a dim-witted stooge who works for the boss, hears Braden drunkenly complain about how he has lost Nellie.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Even if the world your hero lives in is far from ordinary to your readers, it is still the ordinary world for your hero. Describe the world that they live in and show them going about their normal day-to-day activities in that world. Explain their roles and responsibilities in the world and what a typical day looks like for your hero. For example, the ordinary world in Toy Story is Andy's bedroom when the toys are alone and come to life. Woody serves as Andy's toy when Andy wants to play with him, and Woody also conducts toy meetings when Andy is not around. This is the first problem that your hero will face. It might not be life-threatening, but it will be a problem for your hero nonetheless. Describe how that problem comes about and show how your hero responds to it. This is a good opportunity to show some of your hero's likable traits and their flaws. The conflict or call to adventure in Toy Story is when Woody is replaced by Buzz Lightyear. Woody feels rejected and his visible hurt feelings add to his likeability, but he is also very jealous of all of the attention Buzz is getting. Woody's jealousy is one of his flaws. After you describe what adventure or conflict your hero is faced with, show how they refuse or deny it. This may take the form of your hero directly refusing to go on an adventure, or it might be a different kind of denial, such as denying their feelings or denying the truth about something. Your hero might cite practical reasons for refusing the call, but often the hero refuses to go on an adventure out of fear. In Toy Story, Woody refuses the call to adventure by denying that Buzz is Andy's new favorite toy. He also denies his own feelings and that he is jealous of Buzz. Woody's fear of no longer being the favorite is what drives him to deny what is actually happening. When your hero finally starts to accept that they might need to go on the adventure, they will need someone to guide them. Usually, the hero's mentor will be someone with much more experience than they have. However, it might also be a peer who has a different skill set than they do and who they can learn from. In Toy Story, Woody's mentor is Buzz. Even though Buzz is new to Woody's world, he has different abilities than Woody does. Woody learns new things from Buzz while they are in the outside world. Another good example of a hero's guide or mentor in a story is Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. He teaches Luke the ways of the Jedi so that Luke can go on his adventure. This is also known as “crossing the threshold.” At this point in the story, the hero must go on the adventure to stop something terrible from happening or because they have no choice. Explain what happens to your hero or to someone in your hero's world that forces them to pursue their quest. For example, in Toy Story, Woody is forced to go on his adventure after Buzz falls out the window. Buzz falling out the window and Woody encountering him in the car after that happens is when they are over the threshold. Your hero needs to undergo tests to grow. Introducing your hero to new allies and enemies will provide them with assistance and resistance as they work towards their ultimate objective. Think about how you can integrate tests, allies, and enemies into your hero's journey to move the story forward and make it more interesting. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz are tested when they have to work together to find Andy in the arcade. In the arcade, they also meet some new friends, such as the aliens in the claw machine. They also face off with an enemy: Sid, the kid next door who tortures toys. As the story progresses, your hero will get closer and closer to their objective. Describe how your hero glimpses the objective and what still stands in their way. These obstacles might be external, such as an enemy or difficult task, or they might be internal, such as overcoming their pride and asking for help. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz end up in Sid's bedroom and Woody can see his home from where they are. However, the other toys are still leery of him and he cannot return home until he lets go of his jealousy and works with Buzz to get back. At this point in the story, the hero must face the biggest challenge of their journey. This might involve defeating a powerful enemy or obtaining a special item. Describe what your hero must do to overcome this challenge. This is a great opportunity to show how your hero has grown through their adventures. For example, your hero might demonstrate a skill that their mentor tried to teach them, but they struggled to master until this moment. In the example of Toy Story, Woody's greatest challenge is teaming up with Buzz and the other toys in Sid's room to stop Sid from hurting any more toys. They come up with a plan together and work as a team to scare off Sid. After your hero has overcome their biggest challenge, they can obtain the item or other object of their quest. This might be a physical item, such as a key or magic sword, or something symbolic, such as earning the respect of an important figure in their life or gaining a meaningful title. For example, in Toy Story, Woody and Buzz escape from Sid's home and Woody has overcome his jealousy of Buzz. They've developed a meaningful friendship as a result of their adventures. Although your hero has overcome the major obstacle in their story, you may also include one last test for your hero to endure. This test can help to emphasize the hero's growth over the course of your story and provide closure on something that the hero has been struggling to achieve in the background of the story. For example, in Toy Story, Woody's final test is when he has to trust in Buzz and accept his help to get back to Andy. Buzz uses his special skills to get them to the car, and Woody shows that he is no longer jealous of Buzz. He is amazed by him and gladly accepts his help. Your hero may undergo a symbolic or actual death as a result of their ordeal, and then they must also undergo a resurrection. This is when you show how your hero has changed as a result of where they have been and what they have done. For example, Woody compliments Buzz rather than poking fun at him showing that he has grown from the beginning of the story when he was jealous of Buzz and picking fights with him. In some stories, such as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the hero actually dies temporarily. Harry Potter dies, has a vision or visits a place between life and death, and then he is resurrected with new strength to defeat Lord Voldemort. After your hero has completed the final task, describe the new normal of the hero's world. This might look much like the beginning of the story, but with a small, yet noticeable improvement that the hero's successful adventure has created. For example, in Toy Story, the new normal is much like the beginning of the story. However, instead of Woody running the toy meeting on his own, he is co-running it with Buzz. This shows that their friendship is still intact and that there is peace and harmony in Andy's room.","completion":"The story is about a hero who lives in an ordinary world that might seem unusual to us, like Andy's bedroom in Toy Story. The hero has responsibilities and a normal day, but then faces a problem. This problem lets us see the hero's good and bad traits. In Toy Story, Woody feels replaced by Buzz Lightyear and gets jealous. The hero might try to avoid the adventure or their feelings about it. In Toy Story, Woody does that by pretending Buzz isn't the new favorite toy. A helpful and experienced friend helps the hero begin their adventure. Woody's friend is Buzz, who teaches him new things. The hero has to go on the adventure for an important reason, like Woody trying to find Andy after Buzz falls out the window. The hero makes new friends and enemies, and faces tests and challenges along the way. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz meet new friends and enemies, like Sid, the mean kid next door. The hero has to face their biggest challenge before they can succeed. Woody's biggest challenge is working with Buzz and other toys to stop Sid. The hero then achieves their goal, like Woody and Buzz becoming friends. The hero might face one last test and learn even more from it. Woody has to accept Buzz's help to get back to Andy. The hero might also experience a big change, showing how much they have grown from their adventure. Finally, the hero's ordinary world becomes a little bit better because of the adventure. In Toy Story, Woody and Buzz now happily share the leadership among other toys, showing that they are now friends in Andy's room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Map: France’s growing Muslim population A deadly attack on the offices of satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo and subsequent manhunt and hostage crisis has, yet again, focused attention on France's Muslim minority. The French far right, known for its anti-immigrant stance, is saying that its warnings about Islamist extremism have been proven right. Yet for all the attention to them, discovering the exact number of Muslims in France is a surprisingly complicated task – the French government doesn't allow censuses that ask people about their religious beliefs, meaning that estimates have to come from independent sources. One widely cited study by Pew from 2010 showed estimated that France had 4.7 million Muslims. At 7.5 percent of the population, this meant France had the largest Muslim population in Western Europe (for reference, in the same year Pew estimated that the Muslim population in the United States made up 0.8 percent of the total). Other estimates vary from around 5 percent to 12. French census data can't tell us where France's Muslims live, but some past studies have put the percentage of Muslims in Paris as high as 15 percent. What census data can show is that around 9 percent of the population around Paris is made up of non-EU immigrants, though that number is likely influenced by other factors as well (Paris is a major international city, of course). Whatever the actual size, France's Islamic minority has become a subject of concern and sometimes fear-mongering. One online poll conducted by Ipsos Mosi last year found that the average person in France thought that Muslims made up 31 percent of the population in the country, rather than 7.5 percent. As political scientist Steve Saideman puts it on his blog: \\"It is important to understand the real numbers, as fears of swamping generate or exacerbate xenophobia, and in pretty much every case, the populations of Muslims are so small that they are politically powerless.\\" And when it comes to levels of extremism within France's Islamic community, attitudes are again hard to ascertain. One recent poll suggested that 1 in 6 French citizens supported the Islamic State militant organization. When examined closely, its findings seemed incoherent and possibly flawed. (Incidentally, the earliest indications suggest that the Charlie Hebdo attack was carried out by al-Qaeda followers, who now see themselves as rivals to the Islamic State). A more reassuring poll from 2006 found that 73 percent of French Muslims were \\"somewhat\\" or \\"extremely\\" concerned about the threat of Islamist extremism. In 2011, Gallup found that 56 percent of French Muslims felt Western societies \\"respected\\" Muslim societies. Given the variety of different backgrounds French Muslims come from, attempting to singularly define their positions may ultimately a difficult, even impossible task. Perhaps most worrying in the current climate has been the relatively large number of French nationals who are believed to have gone to fight in Syria in 2014. Estimates put these at several hundred. You can see how that compares below (click for enlarged image). France's Muslim minority may be disproportionately represented in some areas of French society (in 2008 it was estimated that between 60 and 70 percent of prison inmates were Muslims). It's worth remembering, however, that two of most famous victims of extremist terrorism in recent years were themselves French Muslims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, a soldier shot dead in Toulouse in 2012, and police officer Ahmed Merabet. Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post. Originally from London, he studied at the University of Manchester and Columbia University.

Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label.

The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Question: \\"What source of money did bin Laden hold in Sudan?\\" Answer: \\"Inheritance\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choose your answer from: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"Answer: (1). no Explanation: The paragraph explicitly states that neither Bin Laden’s inheritance nor his assets in Sudan were a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, while he owned a number of businesses and other assets, these were not used to fund al Qaeda. Furthermore, the idea that Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance was deemed inaccurate when, in early 2000, the U.S. government discovered he received about 1 million per year from 1970 through 1994, but not from a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Therefore, it's incorrect to claim that Bin Laden used his inheritance as a source of money in Sudan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LYONSJULY 14, 2014 Video footage from Al Aqsa TV, the broadcast arm of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, that it says shows an armed drone in flight. JERUSALEM — Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, said on Monday that it had built and flown three types of unmanned aircraft against Israel, all variants of the Ababil-1, an Iranian-made drone. It said two of the drones were armed for attacks and one was intended for reconnaissance. Hamas’s military wing published a photograph that it says shows one of its drones. The image gives no direct indication of how big the aircraft is, what its capabilities are, where it came from or where or when the photo was taken. According to Jane’s Defence Weekly, the Iranian-made Ababil-1 is nine and a half feet long, with a range of about 150 miles, and is able to carry up to 88 pounds of payload, such as explosives or camera equipment. #صورة حصرية وخاصة بطائرة القسام أبابيل 1 المصنعة محلياً وبأيدي كتائب #القسام بفضل الله . pic.twitter.com/DqjvEyN7Kx The group also claimed on its website that it had mounted three drone sorties of at least two aircraft each over Israel on Monday, including one it said had hovered over the Tel Aviv headquarters of the Israel Defense Forces. A spokesman for the I.D.F. said that while he could not rule out other drone flights, he was not aware of any sortie over Tel Aviv. Israel has been talking about a threat of attacks by unmanned aircraft for several years. Compared with the rockets that militant groups typically fire into Israel, drones like the Ababil-1 are potentially capable of greater accuracy and more destructive power, but they also tend to be more susceptible to standard air defenses. In October 2012, the Israeli military said it had shot down a drone over the Negev desert in southern Israel, near Gaza, and was hunting for the wreckage. It did not say where the aircraft had come from. The following month, the military said it had “inflicted severe damage” on Hamas’s drone program with an airstrike. It published a video clip that it said showed a drone being tested on an airstrip in Khan Younis, in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, and then being stored in a warehouse. The video could not be independently verified. Hezbollah, the radical Shiite group in Lebanon, is also believed to have tried using Ababil-1 drones against Israel. The I.D.F. said in April 2013 that it had shot down a drone over the Mediterranean near Haifa that was trying to enter Israeli airspace.

Some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead, with the Speaker of the House of Representatives becoming a de facto Prime Minister. Grover Cleveland, the first Democratic President following Johnson, attempted to restore the power of his office. During his first term, he vetoed over four hundred bills—twice as many bills as his twenty-one predecessors combined. He also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system, replacing them with more \\"deserving\\" individuals. The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, \\"These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment.\\" Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration.

Repellent ISIS now has official rules on who can have sex with female slaves Islamic State theologians have issued an extremely detailed ruling on when “owners” of women enslaved by the extremist group can have sex with them, in an apparent bid to curb what they called violations in the treatment of captured females. The ruling or fatwa has the force of law and appears to go beyond the Islamic State’s previous known utterances on the subject, a leading Islamic State scholar said. It sheds new light on how the group is trying to reinterpret centuries-old teachings to justify the sexual slavery of women in the swaths of Syria and Iraq it controls. To read the fatwa click here: The fatwa was among a huge trove of documents captured by US Special Operations Forces during a raid targeting a top Islamic State official in Syria in May. Reuters has reviewed some of the documents, which have not been previously published. Among the religious rulings are bans on a father and son having sex with the same female slave; and the owner of a mother and daughter having sex with both. Joint owners of a female captive are similarly enjoined from intercourse because she is viewed as “part of a joint ownership.” The United Nations and human rights groups have accused the Islamic State of the systematic abduction and rape of thousands of women and girls as young as 12, especially members of the Yazidi minority in northern Iraq. Many have been given to fighters as a reward or sold as sex slaves. Far from trying to conceal the practice, Islamic State has boasted about it and established a department of “war spoils” to manage slavery. Reuters reported on the existence of the department on Monday. In an April report, Human Rights Watch interviewed 20 female escapees who recounted how Islamic State fighters separated young women and girls from men and boys and older women. They were moved “in an organized and methodical fashion to various places in Iraq and Syria.” They were then sold or given as gifts and repeatedly raped or subjected to sexual violence. Fatwa No. 64, dated Jan. 29, 2015, and issued by Islamic State’s Committee of Research and Fatwas, appears to codify sexual relations between IS fighters and their female captives for the first time, going further than a pamphlet issued by the group in 2014 on how to treat slaves. The fatwa starts with a question: “Some of the brothers have committed violations in the matter of the treatment of the female slaves. These violations are not permitted by Sharia law because these rules have not been dealt with in ages. Are there any warnings pertaining to this matter?” It then lists 15 injunctions, which in some instances go into explicit detail. For example: “If the owner of a female captive, who has a daughter suitable for intercourse, has sexual relations with the latter, he is not permitted to have intercourse with her mother and she is permanently off limits to him. Should he have intercourse with her mother then he is not permitted to have intercourse with her daughter and she is to be off limits to him.” Islamic State’s sexual exploitation of female captives has been well documented, but a leading IS expert at Princeton University, Cole Bunzel, who has reviewed many of the group’s writings, said the fatwa went beyond what has previously been published by the militants on how to treat female slaves. “It reveals the actual concerns of IS slave owners,” he said in an email. Still, he cautioned that not “everything dealt with in the fatwa is indicative of a relevant violation. It doesn’t mean father and son were necessarily sharing a girl. They’re at least being ‘warned’ not to. But I bet some of these violations were being committed.” The fatwa also instructs owners of female slaves to “show compassion towards her, be kind to her, not humiliate her, and not assign her work she is unable to perform.” An owner should also not sell her to an individual whom he knows will mistreat her. Professor Abdel Fattah Alawari, dean of Islamic Theology at Al-Azhar University, a 1,000-year-old Egyptian center for Islamic learning, said Islamic State “has nothing to do with Islam” and was deliberately misreading centuries-old verses and sayings that were originally designed to end, rather than encourage, slavery. “Islam preaches freedom to slaves, not slavery. Slavery was the status quo when Islam came around,” he said. “Judaism, Christianity, Greek, Roman, and Persian civilizations all practiced it and took the females of their enemies as sex slaves. So Islam found this abhorrent practice and worked to gradually remove it.” In September 2014 more than 120 Islamic scholars from around the world issued an open letter to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi refuting the group’s religious arguments to justify many of its actions. The scholars noted that the “reintroduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"ISIS theologians have issued an extremely detailed fatwa ruling on when \\"owners\\" of women enslaved by the extremist group can have sex with them, in an attempt to curb violations in the treatment of captured females.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Nuclear power's danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation. Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years. This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.

Here is a news article: HONG KONG — The mystery surrounding five missing Hong Kong booksellers specializing in literature critical of China deepened after one purportedly wrote a letter saying he was helping with an investigation on the mainland, prompting his wife to drop a missing person's report. Hong Kong police said late Monday that Lee Bo's wife canceled the report, but added they would continue investigating the other cases. They didn't say whether Lee had been located. Protesters hold up missing person notices of the missing Hong Kong booksellers, as they walk towards China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Sunday. ANTHONY WALLACE / AFP - Getty Images Lee and four other people associated with publisher Mighty Current, which specializes in books critical of China's Communist Party leaders, have vanished in recent months. Their disappearances have prompted fears that Beijing is eroding the \\"one country, two systems principle\\" that's been in place since Britain ceded control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, granting the city civil liberties nonexistent on the mainland, including freedom of the press. When Lee vanished last Wednesday, he reportedly did not have his travel permit for mainland China with him, triggering speculation that Chinese security agents entered Hong Kong to abduct and spirit him there. An image of Lee's handwritten letter was first published by Taiwan's government-affiliated Central News Agency late Monday. The letter, faxed to an employee at the publishing company's Causeway Bay Bookstore, said: \\"Due to some urgent matters that I need to handle and that aren't to be revealed to the public, I have made way own way back to the mainland in order to cooperate with the investigation by relevant parties.\\" It added: \\"It might take a bit of time. My current situation is very well. All is normal.\\" The letter gave no further details. Local media reported that Lee's wife, Choi Ka-ping, asked police to drop the missing person's report after learning of the letter, the authenticity of which could not be independently confirmed. Police walk past missing person notices of Gui Minhai (left), one of five missing booksellers from the Mighty Current publishing house, and Yau Wentian (right), a Hong Kong publisher who was last year jailed for 10 years while preparing to release a book critical of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Anthony Wallace / AFP - Getty Images Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers and human rights activists were skeptical the letter proved Lee was safe. \\"If he did indeed write the letter, it was almost certainly written under duress,\\" said William Nee, Amnesty International's China researcher. \\"What we see in mainland China all the time is that police and state security put enormous pressure on family members not to speak to media and not to raise a fuss on social media.\\" China's nationalist newspaper Global Times slammed the bookshop in an editorial Monday for \\"profiting on political rumors\\" and selling books with \\"trumped-up content.\\" Hong Kong police still have missing person's files open for three other staff members or shareholders of the publisher or the bookstore. A fifth person, Gui Minhai, a Swedish national who is one of the company's owners, went missing in Thailand in October, according to Hong Kong media and human rights groups. Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joakim Edvardsson said Monday that the government was \\"very concerned\\" that a Swedish national had disappeared. He declined to name the person, in line with Foreign Ministry policy, but said he was in his 50s. Britain said that it was \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of the disappearance and possible detention of one of its nationals. But speaking to reporters at a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Beijing on a two-day trip, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on others not to make \\"groundless accusations\\" on the case. ||||| A pro-democracy demonstrator burns a letter next to pictures of missing staff members of a publishing house and a bookstore, including Gui Minhai, a China-born Swedish national who is the owner of Mighty Current, Cheung Jiping, the business manager of the publishing house... REUTERS/Tyrone Siu BEIJING Britain said on Tuesday that it was \\"deeply concerned\\" by reports of the disappearance and possible detention of five Hong Kong booksellers specializing in publications critical of China, one of whom is British, and urged the city's commitment to press freedom. A spokesperson for the British embassy in Beijing called on authorities in Hong Kong, a former British colony, and China to ascertain its citizen's welfare and whereabouts. It did not identify the person. \\"We are deeply concerned by reports about the disappearance and detention of individuals associated with the Causeway Bay Books bookstore in Hong Kong,\\" said the spokesperson, according to a statement from the British embassy in Beijing. \\"We encourage the Hong Kong SAR government to honor its commitment to protecting the freedom of the press, and we hope the Chinese authorities will continue to make every effort to ensure that the environment in which the media and publishers operate in the Hong Kong SAR supports full and frank reporting.\\" The remarks, referring to the \\"special administrative region\\" (SAR) of Hong Kong, came as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond began his two-day visit to China and after China's foreign ministry warned that it would not tolerate outside interference in the affairs of Hong Kong. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of wide-ranging autonomy and an independent judiciary and media under a \\"one country, two systems\\" formula. Lee Bo, 65, a shareholder of Causeway Bay Books, \\"vanished\\" last week, according to a missing person report filed by Lee's wife on Thursday. Four associates involved in publishing or selling literature critical of Beijing have also gone missing in mysterious circumstances over the past few months. The disappearances have stoked fears of mainland Chinese authorities using shadowy tactics that erode the \\"one country, two systems\\" formula under which Hong Kong returned to China. Asked about the possibility of several of the booksellers holding British passports, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that \\"Hong Kong is China's domestic affair\\". \\"No foreign country has the right to interfere,\\" she said at a daily news briefing. She said that \\"any Hong Kong residents of Chinese descent born in Chinese territory, including Hong Kong people,\\" were Chinese citizens. Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying said on Monday there was no indication so far outside agents were involved in the disappearance of the booksellers, but that it would be \\"unacceptable\\" if any were. (Writing By Sui-Lee Wee; Editing by Nick Macfie) ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption (L to R) Gui Minhai, Cheung Jiping and Paul Lee, whose pictures were held up by protesters on Sunday, have gone missing in recent days When four associates of the Causeway Bay Bookstore went missing last October, it was their colleague, Paul Lee who raised the alarm. Mr Lee, who along with his wife, is a shareholder in the bookstore and the publishing house that owns it, took charge of briefing journalists, dealing with advocacy groups and speaking with law enforcement officials. At the time, he told me he felt safe in Hong Kong. Besides avoiding travel to the mainland, he made few changes to his routine. And tucked away on the first floor of a dingy building, the tiny bookstore was operating as usual, selling paperbacks that purported to tell all about the salacious private lives of top Chinese leaders. But last week, Mr Lee - also known as Lee Bo - appeared to have suffered the same fate as the other four missing men. His disappearance last Wednesday has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition - because of a possible book about the private life of President Xi Jinping. Image copyright EPA Image caption Causeway Bay Books was known for carrying literature that could be gossipy about mainland politics When contacted by phone last Thursday, his wife, herself a writer, told me she had been unable to reach him on his mobile phone. \\"I can tell you I am really afraid,\\" she said. \\"I can't get through to him. But he has called me. He asked me not to make a fuss. That he would get himself out of the situation somehow. He was not able to say more about his circumstances.\\" Besides worrying about her husband, who was usually home by 7:15pm every evening for dinner, Mrs Lee was deeply concerned about how his absence would affect their autistic son, who is in his 20s and living at home. She also said she had disagreed with the high-profile way in which Mr Lee had spoken to the media after their colleagues had first disappeared. One of them, publishing house owner Gui Minhai, was last seen in Thailand, and the other three were last seen in China. Image caption Mr Lee had previously told the BBC that he felt safe in Hong Kong Although she spoke to me, Mrs Lee made it clear that she did not wish to overly publicise their story with international media, in case the attention harmed her husband's chances of returning home. But because of the unusual, even extraordinary details of this case, one family's plight has made headlines around the world. Mrs Lee later reportedly told Hong Kong media that her husband appeared to have called her from Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city across the border from Hong Kong. And that his home return permit, which he is required to show to enter China, was still at home. Those details, plus an unconfirmed police report showing no record of Mr Lee ever having left Hong Kong, were enough to convince veteran lawmaker and human rights activist Albert Ho that the bookseller had been kidnapped. Image caption Albert Ho (third from right) spoke at a press conference convened by activists on Sunday \\"He must have been forced to go under duress or intimidation,\\" Mr Ho told the BBC. \\"And then very probably he left through some channel without going through the immigration counter. So that's what has led to our observation that he was kidnapped and smuggled to China.\\" Mr Ho said he believed the five associates had been detained because of a purported book, commissioned and possibly written by publisher Gui Minhai, about a former mistress of President Xi, when he was already married to folk singer Peng Liyuan. Before his disappearance, Mr Lee told me his last contact with Mr Gui was via email on 15 October, when the publisher had instructed printers to get ready for a new book. He said he would send the material shortly. He was not seen again. Mr Lee believed that book, the subject of which he was not privy to, had caused the detentions. Image caption Causeway Bay Books had carried other titles, including this one discussing the women in Xi Jinping's life The reaction in Hong Kong to news of the first batch of disappearances was mild. Thailand was perceived as being vulnerable to Chinese interference. And in China, extrajudicial detention is not unknown. But Mr Lee's case is unprecedented, according to Mr Ho, because it involves a permanent resident of Hong Kong being possibly taken outside legal channels by Chinese agents with no jurisdiction in this city. For some people in Hong Kong, it is their worst nightmare: the spectre of Chinese officials reaching beyond the mainland to detain those who are accused transgressing against them. \\"The enforcement of law in Hong Kong is a domestic affair. It should be left to the local enforcement agency. This is, in fact, a very important line drawn between Hong Kong and the mainland. That is what has made Hong Kong feel safe. That we are under the protection of a completely different system,\\" said Mr Ho. There has been no official comment form the Chinese authorities. But in a recent opinion piece (in Chinese), the Global Times, a mouthpiece of the government, has criticised accusations that the \\"one country, two systems\\" model was in jeopardy. Image copyright BBC Chinese Image caption The five missing people are all linked to this small bookshop in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay The high-profile nature of the case has drawn comment from Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung who said his government is attaching great importance to the case. He reiterated that only Hong Kong officials can enforce the law in the city and that mainland officials have no jurisdiction. The city's acting security chief has also appealed for information in the case. However, human rights activists who staged a protest over Mr Lee's disappearance over the weekend are not optimistic officials will get to the bottom of the disappearance. As for the bookshop, it closed a day after Mr Lee's disappearance. \\"Something terrible has happened. We are all afraid. We are leaving now,\\" an employee told me a few hours before locking the doors for the foreseeable future. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The mystery surrounding the five missing Hong Kong booksellers, who specialise in books that are critical of China, has deepened after one of them apparently wrote a letter saying he was helping with an investigation on the mainland, leading his wife to drop her missing person's report.

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip.

Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores. The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which pack was preying more upon herds? Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Mobutu pack. Step 1: Identify the packs' hunting strategies. - The Simba pack is ambushing wounded individual prey animals. - The Mobutu pack is following large groups of zebras and other grazers. Step 2: Consider the hint given. - The hint suggests that individuals living in large groups, like zebras, may be safer from attack due to the difficulty predators have when targeting an individual prey animal within the group.

Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women. Following its release, Control became Jackson's first album to top the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and five of its commercial singles—\\"What Have You Done for Me Lately\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Control\\", \\"When I Think of You\\", and \\"Let's Wait Awhile\\"—peaked within the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Music videos created to promote the singles showcased her dancing ability and became a catalyst for MTV's evolving demographics. The album went on to receive several accolades, including a nomination for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and winning Producer of the Year, Non-Classical for Jam and Lewis in 1987.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Biologically, a child (plural: children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. The legal definition of \\"child\\" generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority. - A toy is an item that is generally used for children's play. Playing with toys is supposed to be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \\"fly it.\\" Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collector's items and are intended for display only. - A glockenspiel (or , \\"Glocken\\": bells and \\"Spiel\\": game) is a percussion instrument composed of a set of tuned keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano. In this way, it is similar to the xylophone; however, the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The glockenspiel, moreover, is usually smaller and higher in pitch. - Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees, and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. - The Pixiphone was a range of toy glockenspiels ( although they were inaccurately labelled as xylophones on their packaging ) . The larger Pixiphones had a ' raiser - bar ' which could be used to end a note abruptly , rather than letting it fade naturally . Although marketed as a children 's toy , the Pixiphone could be tuned pitch - perfect and was very robust , resulting in many children using them at British schools . - Clay is a fine-grained natural rock or soil material that combines one or more clay minerals with traces of metal oxides and organic matter. Clays are plastic due to their water content and become hard, brittle and nonplastic upon drying or firing. Geologic clay deposits are mostly composed of phyllosilicate minerals containing variable amounts of water trapped in the mineral structure. Depending on the soil's content in which it is found, clay can appear in various colours from white to dull grey or brown to deep orange-red. Although many naturally occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences in size and mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 45 m, and colloid chemists use 1 m. Geotechnical engineers distinguish between silts and clays based on the plasticity properties of the soil, as measured by the soils' Atterberg limits. ISO 14688 grades clay particles as being smaller than 2 m and silt particles as being larger. - The xylophone (from the Greek words \\"xylon\\", \\"wood\\" + \\"phn\\", \\"sound, voice\\", meaning \\"wooden sound\\") is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use. What is the relationship between 'pixiphone' and 'idiophone'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The relationship between 'pixiphone' and 'idiophone' lies in the fact that a pixiphone is a type of idiophone. An idiophone is a class of musical instruments that produce sound through the vibration of the instrument's body itself, without the use of strings, membranes, or columns of air. These instruments typically create sound by being struck, shaken, or scraped. A pixiphone is a particular type of idiophone, specifically a toy glockenspiel. It consists of a series of tuned metal plates or bars, arranged in a keyboard-like layout, and is played by striking the plates with mallets. Although marketed as a children's toy, the pixiphone can be tuned to produce pitch-perfect notes, and has been used in schools and music education settings. So, in summary, the pixiphone is a type of idiophone, as it generates sound through the vibrations of its metal plates when struck by a mallet."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Zell Bryan Miller (February 24, 1932 - March 23, 2018) was an American author and politician from the U.S. state of Georgia. A Democrat, Miller served as lieutenant governor from 1975 to 1991, 79th Governor of Georgia from 1991 to 1999, and as U.S. Senator from 2000 to 2005. Miller was a conservative Democrat. In 2004, he supported Republican President George W. Bush against the Democratic nominee John Kerry in the presidential election. Miller was elected governor of Georgia in 1990, defeating Republican Johnny Isakson (who later became his successor as U.S. Senator) after defeating Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and future Governor Roy Barnes in the primary. Miller campaigned on the concept of term limits and pledged to seek only a single term as governor. He later ran for and won re-election in 1994. James Carville was Miller's campaign manager. In 1991, Miller endorsed Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for President of the United States. Miller gave the keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. In two oft-recalled lines, Miller said that President George H. W. Bush \\"just doesn't get it,\\" and he remarked of a statement by Vice President Dan Quayle: As governor, Miller was a staunch promoter of public education. He helped found the HOPE Scholarship, which paid for the college tuition of Georgia students who both established a GPA of 3.0 in high school and maintained the same while in college, and who were from families earning less than 66,000 per year. The HOPE Scholarships were funded by revenue collected from the state lottery. In December 1995, his office announced a proposal for 1 billion more in spending on education. HOPE won praise from national Democratic leaders. The HOPE Scholarship program still to this day provides Georgia students with an opportunity to attend a public college or university, who otherwise may have no opportunity to do so. Upon leaving the governor's office in January 1999, Miller accepted teaching positions at Young Harris College, Emory University, and the University of Georgia. He was a visiting professor at all three institutions when he was appointed to the U.S. Senate. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else can you tell me about his time as governor","completion":"During his time as governor, Zell Miller was a staunch promoter of public education.

Summarize this article: A 17th body is recovered from the Costa Concordia, but at least 16 more people are missing as weather hampers efforts to remove a half-million gallons of fuel. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports from Isola del Giglio. Published 11:55 a.m. ET GIGLIO, Italy -- Inclement weather on Sunday has shut down search and salvage efforts at the site of the Costa Concordia cruise ship wreck off the island of Giglio near the Tuscan coast. The ship shifted more than one inch overnight, and rescue divers were pulled from the water and are waiting for better conditions, NBC News has learned. On Saturday, divers searching the submerged sixth floor deck found a woman’s body – the 17th body found since the ship ran aground on Jan. 13. Sixteen people are still unaccounted for. Related: 17th body found on Costa Concordia Separately, a body found on the ship’s deck on Jan. 28 was identified as Erika Soria Molina, 25, of Peru. Molina was wearing a service uniform, and studied tourism in Peru and was born in the Andean city of Cuzco, southeast of Lima, the Associated Press reported. High winds and rough seas delayed plans to begin pumping 500,000 gallons of fuel off the Concordia. That effort will likely continue midweek. A barge carrying pumping equipment that was attached to the capsized ship was withdrawn after strong winds and high waves worsened conditions for the divers working on the huge wreck.

The company is weighing bids and is expected to make its decision -- based on method and costs -- in two months. The removal could take up to 10 months. The Costa Concordia disaster is expected to trigger the most expensive maritime insurance claim ever, and has set off a legal battle in which U.S. and Italian lawyers are preparing class-action and individual lawsuits against the operator, Costa Cruises. In a bid to limit the fallout, Costa, a unit of Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise ship operator, has offered the more than 3,000 passengers 14,460 each in compensation on condition they drop any legal action.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the suggested answer is accurate and relevant to the question being asked. Prosecutors obtain evidence for criminal court through a variety of sources and methods in order to build a strong case against the accused individual. It is essential to validate this answer, as it provides a brief explanation of the prosecution's role and responsibility in a criminal trial. To present a more detailed answer, prosecutors gather evidence from multiple sources and through various means, which may include: 1. Police reports: When law enforcement officers investigate a crime, they compile a detailed report outlining the circumstances surrounding the incident, witness statements, and any physical evidence collected at the scene. Prosecutors review these reports to obtain valuable information that may support their case. 2. Witness testimony: Eyewitnesses or those with knowledge related to the crime are crucial sources of evidence. Prosecutors may interview these individuals and subpoena them to testify in court. 3. Expert testimony: In some cases, it may be necessary for the prosecution to call upon experts in various fields (e.g., forensics, ballistics, or psychiatry) to provide professional opinions and analysis, which can help to clarify specific points of the case or provide context for certain pieces of evidence. 4. Physical evidence: Prosecutors work closely with law enforcement agencies and forensic experts to analyze any physical evidence collected during the investigation. This can include weapon, blood, or other biological samples, as well as latent fingerprints, photographs, and surveillance footage. 5. Documentary evidence: This can include various written or electronic records, such as emails, text messages, phone records, financial statements, or other documents that are relevant to the case and can help establish the facts surrounding the alleged criminal activity. 6. Confessions or statements made by the accused: In some instances, the accused may make incriminating statements or confess to the crime. Such statements, if admissible in court, can be an essential piece of evidence that strengthens the prosecution's case. 7. Investigative work by detectives or other law enforcement officers: Law enforcement officers may conduct further interviews, surveillance, or investigative activities to gather additional evidence that can be presented in court. This can also include undercover operations and wiretaps. The task of assembling and presenting this evidence in court falls upon the prosecution, who must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime in question. This is done by weaving all the evidence together to create a narrative that demonstrates the accused's guilt, leaving no room for reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors. By verifying and validating this answer, you acknowledge the essential role prosecutors play in ensuring justice and maintaining the integrity of the criminal court system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Growth continued for ten years, and by 1915 the town had telephones, round-the-clock electricity, and a growing population — many of whom worked in the railroad repair shop. But such heady progress would soon come to a halt. The growing competition in rail transport resulted in Union Pacific buying the Los Angeles–Salt Lake line. Union Pacific then consolidated its operations, eliminating the Las Vegas repair facility. Additionally, Las Vegas had been made a part of Nevada's new Clark County in 1909, a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling. These unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents. But the southwest's growing need for water, combined with Las Vegas's fortuitous proximity to the Colorado River, would give Las Vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity. Construction on Hoover Dam (originally Boulder Dam, subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project) began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Las Vegas. Providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy, Hoover Dam played a major role in preventing Las Vegas from drying up, both financially and literally. Not only did it create jobs, but it also created Lake Mead, the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern Nevada. More Government Help: The construction of Hoover Dam did not single-handedly save Las Vegas, however. The state legislature helped as well, by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town, though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time. The hordes of people who attended Hoover Dam's 1935 dedication set the city's now-formidable public relations machine into action. They went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted. It didn't take long for the city to establish itself as a wild-West town with an \\"anything goes\\" attitude. Vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here, available any hour of any day (or night). Question: \\"What circumstances threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents?\\" Answer: \\"Drought and heat\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer \\"Drought and heat\\" is not correct based on the paragraph. The circumstances that threatened to relegate Las Vegas to the status of a small desert community were the elimination of the Las Vegas repair facility by Union Pacific and the outlawing of gambling in 1909 by the Nevada legislature. These events could have caused economic decline and made it difficult for Las Vegas to support its 3000 residents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Combine the similar terms on the right side of the equation. 106*f - 53*f = 53*f Now the equation is: 45*f + 56 = 53*f Step 2: Move the term with the variable 'f' from the left side of the equation to the right side by subtracting the term '45*f' from both sides. 45*f - 45*f + 56 = 53*f - 45*f This simplifies to: 56 = 8*f Step 3: Now we solve for 'f' by isolating it on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of f, which is 8. 56 ÷ 8 = 8*f ÷ 8 This simplifies to: 7 = f And the answer is f = 7."},{"prompt":"Artie Shaw became famous playing a clarinet in what outfit? - orchestra - jazz band - rock band - music store - music studio The best answer is The answer to this question is:","completion":"jazz band"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A line of law enforcement vehicles stretched for a mile along a rural Pennsylvania road Tuesday as the hunt for suspected cop-killer Eric Matthew Frein entered its 11th day. Area schools opened for the first time since the middle of last week, although school buses were kept off roads because of the heavy police activity. There was increased security throughout the Pocono Mountain School District, and students would remain indoors, according to the district website. \\"This is an extremely difficult situation for our community,\\" the school district website said in announcing schools reopened Tuesday. \\"Schools will be in session but, ultimately it is your decision as parents whether to send your children to school. The District will respect your decision and all absences will be excused and will not impact a student's perfect attendance.\\" For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock-down since Frein -- a 31-year-old self-styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer September 12 during an ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, attendance in the 9,800-student district was down about 30%, a school official said. After-school athletic practices were moved indoors, and home athletic competitions canceled. \\"It's a difficult time for our parents,\\" district spokeswoman Wendy Frable told CNN. \\"A lot of parents are still a little nervous.\\" The shooting unleashed a massive manhunt involving hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement agents. Life in the otherwise quiet community in the Pocono Mountains was disrupted as thousands of residents were under lock-down, and schools and some roads closed near the densely wooded search area. On Tuesday, two days after authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe Frein is hiding, the search moved slightly north, police said. \\"He's out in those woods right now,\\" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters a day earlier. State Police Lt. Col George Bivens, who joined the governor, said, \\"I do believe that we are close to him at this point.\\" Tracking dogs had indicated \\"we're on the right trail,\\" Bivens said a day earlier, adding that thermal imaging technology was being used to find Frein, who authorities believe had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years. Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein, who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist. Slaying planned for months? Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. When asked why investigators concluded that, Corbett answered that the night of the barracks shooting, Frein had the opportunity to shoot civilians and didn't take it. As to the rifle that was found over the weekend, it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen, though the items were partially concealed, Bivens said. \\"Frein obviously knows we're there\\" searching, he said. Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles from where Frein allegedly shot the police officers.

Chairman WASHINGTON — Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said on Thursday that he would resign effective mid-February. His departure will end a four-year tenure in which he pushed for online privacy protections and sought to restrain unfair competition, but stumbled in an attempt to rein in the Internet search practices of Google. Mr. Leibowitz, 54, said in an interview that he intended to move to the private sector and was likely to focus on competition policy and privacy. His departure was widely expected and had been talked about among antitrust lawyers since last summer. “I felt like this was a good time to leave because we got through a number of things that I wanted the commission to address,” he said, citing the blocking of several regional hospital mergers and cases brought against Facebook and Google for violating their own privacy policies. This spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an F.T.C. case involving generic drug companies that agree to delay putting new products on the market in exchange for payments from brand-name pharmaceutical companies that market similar drugs. Mr. Leibowitz’s successor could come from within the commission, with Democratic commissioners Julie Brill and Edith Ramirez considered contenders. Other possible candidates are Howard Shelanski, an antitrust expert who is director of the commission’s bureau of economics, and Philip J. Weiser, a former aide to Joel Klein at the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Under Mr. Leibowitz, who was a commissioner for more than four years before being appointed chairman in 2009, the commission also worked to expand the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and brought an enforcement action against Intel for unfair competitive practices in the microprocessor market. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is the new chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Mr. Leibowitz had been able to get bipartisan attention paid to issues like generic-drug competition and telephone billing practices in part because of his experience as a staff aide on Capitol Hill. “He’s done really aggressive work to stop these pay-for-delay settlements,” she said, referring to drug industry practices. He also drew attention to cramming, the addition of unauthorized, often-unnoticed charges to consumers’ phone bills, she said. Other Democrats, including some consumer advocates, were less generous in their assessment, although none of them wanted to speak on the record. They noted, however, a few areas where the F.T.C. did not block merger actions, including a 2 billion proposal to join the Universal Music Group and EMI, two large record labels. Last year, the commission also approved the 29 billion merger of two of the nation’s largest pharmacy-benefit managers, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions. If only because it was his last big effort, however, the Google case is likely to be the one that is foremost in people’s minds over the next few years. Mr. Leibowitz sought the case, winning a cordial but tense battle with the Justice Department’s antitrust division over the right to investigate Google’s search practices. Competitors, advertisers and some consumer advocates had complained that Google manipulated the results of its Internet searches to give top priority to results that featured companies in which it held an interest, while punishing those that were a competitive threat. It was a widely watched case, not only because Google was one of the country’s largest companies, a symbol of the enormous success that could be bred by the Internet, but also because Mr. Leibowitz had made anticompetition enforcement a high priority. In 2009, shortly after he took over as chairman of the commission, Mr. Leibowitz threw down the gauntlet at a conference of antitrust lawyers, saying he intended to push the F.T.C. to protect consumers “by expanding the use of our authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition.” That authority, laid out in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, allows the commission more leeway than do antitrust laws to sanction companies for actions that might not be antitrust violations but that are unfair and deceptive practices. But when the F.T.C.’s five commissioners looked closely at Google’s practices, they unanimously agreed that while some of its behavior was not beneficial to competitors, over all its actions improved its search results for the benefits of users. The commission did get Google to agree to voluntarily change some of its methods; critics of that agreement, including one commissioner who dissented on that part of the decision, said the voluntary agreement was essentially unenforceable because it did not have court authority behind it. The F.T.C. did bring formal charges against Google in another matter, reaching a settlement of charges that Google illegally refused to license some of its patents for cellular phone technology to companies, like Apple, whose products compete with Google’s Android operating system. “That would have been a much harder case to bring under antitrust law,” Mr. Leibowitz said. Asked if he felt the Google case was a failure, Mr. Leibowitz gave an unequivocal no. “You don’t take these jobs without wanting to bring a big case,” he said. “But I think we did our job there.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about Jon Leibowitz resigning from his position as the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Options: - exhaustion - shortness of breath - heart attacks - blisters - diabetes The answer is \\"heart attacks\\" because Answer:","completion":"Too much jogging for elderly people can lead to several health issues, including: 1. Exhaustion: Prolonged jogging without proper rest and recovery can cause fatigue in elderly people, making them more vulnerable to injuries and reducing their ability to perform daily activities. 2. Shortness of breath: Excessive jogging can lead to labored breathing, especially if the individual has pre-existing respiratory issues like asthma or COPD. Prolonged shortness of breath can result in reduced stamina and can put unnecessary strain on the heart. 3. Heart attacks: Over-exertion during jogging, among other high-intensity exercises, can increase the risk of heart attacks in elderly people, especially those with existing cardiovascular diseases. The excessive strain on the heart can lead to an oxygen deficiency in the cardiac muscles, potentially resulting in a heart attack. 4. Blisters: Elderly people have thinner skin, which makes them more prone to blisters and skin injuries while jogging. Blisters can become painful and infected if not treated properly, affecting the individual's ability to continue exercising. 5. Diabetes: While this option may seem counterintuitive, as exercise is usually recommended to help manage diabetes, people with uncontrolled diabetes may experience exacerbated symptoms if they engage in intense exercise like jogging. Intense exercise can cause a surge in blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous for those with diabetes. In conclusion, the risk of heart attacks is one of the potential consequences of too much jogging for elderly people. However, other issues like exhaustion, shortness of breath, blisters, and complications related to diabetes are also possible. It is advisable for elderly people to consult a healthcare professional before starting a jogging routine, to ensure its safety and appropriateness for their individual health needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Hughes Glomar Explorer was more than just a giant ship — it was a giant secret, possibly the biggest and strangest covert operation the CIA pulled off during the Cold War. But now, 40 years after its original mission, it’s finally headed to the scrapyard. The ship, now called GSF Explorer, had been retrofitted for oil drilling and exploration since it left US Navy service in 1997. But with the price of oil falling worldwide, its owner Transocean has decided to scrap it, along with several other vessels. The ship’s origin story began in March 1968, when a Soviet Golf II class ballistic missile nuclear submarine, the K-129, sank in the Pacific Ocean. This was at the height of a high-risk cat-and-mouse game between the USA and the USSR. After the Soviet Navy failed to pinpoint the location of the wreckage, the US Navy found it. So the CIA decided to raise it off the seabed. They called this mission “Project Azorian,” and its details have been an official secret for decades. It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission to publish in 2012 his account of the mission and his role. Sharp was at the engineering meetings where they tried to come up with a way to do what was at the time considered impossible, to pull up a huge object from an ocean depth of nearly 17,000 feet, or three miles. “I think given a better background in marine engineering, we likely would not have tried” what they did, Sharp says. Luckily, the CIA also brought in skilled contractors like the deepwater drilling experts Global Marine (whose truncated name “Glomar” adorns the vessel). What they designed may never be seen again: The Hughes Glomar Explorer itself was massive — too wide to fit in the Panama Canal — and it was built to heave up and down on waves while its center held steady, lifting an enormous claw with the K-129 wreckage inside. Every piece of this hydraulic lifting apparatus was its own engineering nightmare, from the gymbals with bowling-ball-sized ball bearings, to the heave compensators and derrick that had to handle 14 million pounds of submarine, claw, and heavy pipe string. Lockheed engineers designed the “claw” itself, more accurately called a “capture vehicle,” and got it into the HGE via an elaborate submersible barge (echoes of which a few people detected during the 2013’s not-as-awesome Google Barge mystery). It would be impossible for the US military to build such a huge and complicated ship, or to bring it out on the high seas, without getting the attention of the Soviets. Hence the true wonder of Project Azorian: its commercial cover story, one that puts the movie “Argo” to shame. From about 1970-74, the CIA managed to convince the world that billionaire inventor Howard Hughes had decided to invest millions to mine “manganese nodules,” balls of heavy metals that lie on the ocean floor. Via fake press releases, events, technical specs and front companies, the CIA convinced the world that Hughes was leading a new ocean-mining rush. In the end, the expensive mission was only a partial success: the ship’s lifting apparatus broke apart about 9000 feet below the surface, and the majority of the K-129 fell back to the floor of the ocean. It was impossible to retrieve without building a new claw, and before that could happen, details of the mission broke in the press. That didn’t stop the CIA from trying to keep it under wraps for as long as possible, leading to its notorious “Glomar Response” to Freedom of Information Act requests: the non-answer “we can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the materials requested.” That answer has held up in court over the decades and proliferated among federal and even local government agencies. It was also the inspiration for the extra-dry humor of the CIA’s first tweet. We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet. — CIA (@CIA) June 6, 2014 Hughes Glomar Explorer entered popular culture in other ways, as conspiracy theories have swirled around the K-129 and the mission to retrieve it. One of them is promulgated in the 2005 book “Red Star Rogue” by Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond. The book became the basis of the 2013 drama \\"Phantom,\\" which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way. In 2006, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers declared Hughes Glomar Explorer an historic landmark. “Grasping and raising a 2,000-ton object in 17,000 feet of water in the central Pacific Ocean was a truly historic challenge, requiring a recovery system of unprecedented size and scope,” ASME wrote. Americans can remember the whole affair for its daring, hubris, disappointment and secrecy. But for the loved ones of the Soviet sailors who died on the K-129, the words “Hughes Glomar Explorer” are more bitter. The Soviet government tried for 30 years to keep the fate of the submarine a secret from the families. After the USSR fell apart, both the Russian and US governments decided to make a clean slate of it, and then-US Defense Secretary Robert Gates delivered some of the intelligence on Project Azorian to the Russian government, along with artifacts from the chunk of the submarine the CIA managed to retrieve. Gates also released a secret video of a funeral at sea for the remains of six Soviet sailors that were pulled up from the ocean floor. It remains one of the strangest artifacts of the entire Cold War — the other being ship itself, but it appears that one will not be with us for much longer. Giant floating Museum of Secrecy, anyone? Hear more of Julia Barton's reporting on the Hughes Glomar Explorer over at Radiolab from WNYC. ||||| (Repeats story that ran on Thursday, with no changes to text) By John Miller ZURICH, Sept 3 (Reuters) - A ship built by the CIA for a secret Cold War mission in 1974 to raise a sunken Soviet sub is heading to the scrap yard, a victim of the slide in oil prices. Christened the Hughes Glomar Explorer, after billionaire Howard Hughes was brought in on the CIA's deception, the 619-foot vessel eventually became part of the fleet of ships used by Swiss company Transocean to drill for oil. But the oil price rout means the former spy ship now called GSF Explorer is just one of 40 such offshore drilling rigs that have been consigned to scrap since last year. It's the end of a story that began when a Soviet G-II sub called the K-129 sank in September 1968 \\"with all hands, 16,500 feet below the surface of the Pacific\\", according to an official U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) history. The sub sank with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and nearly 100 sailors, according to declassified documents at George Washington University's National Security Archive. According to the CIA history of the mission, called \\"Project Azorian\\", the Soviet Union failed to locate the sub in a massive two-month search, but the United States found it, 1,500 miles (2,400 km) northwest of Hawaii. The CIA wanted to get its hands on the nuclear missiles, as well as cryptography gear to break Soviet codes, but needed a cover story because any recovery ship would quickly be spotted by its Cold War foe. The CIA brought billionaire Hughes in on the secret. Under a meticulously crafted fiction, the ship was built for Hughes at Pennsylvania's Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co, because he needed it to mine sea-bed manganese nodules. \\"If the Russians had become aware of the real purpose of the mission, we'd have had to cancel it, and all the money would go down the drain,\\" David Sharp, a 50-year CIA veteran from Maryland who was the 1974 mission's deputy for recovery operations, told Reuters in an interview. COVER BLOWN While the CIA has over the years lavished billions on covert planes and spacecraft, Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, told Reuters: \\"They have not built anything so elaborate as the Glomar for such a limited mission\\". Too wide for the Panama Canal, the Hughes Glomar Explorer, also named after the company Global Marine Inc. that designed it, rounded Cape Horn to reach the Pacific. In August 1974, its huge mechanical claw raised a 145-foot section of the K-129 Soviet sub. Sharp, now 81, who published \\"The CIA's Greatest Covert Operation\\" in 2011 after years of wrangling with the agency over classified material, acknowledged the audacious mission was not a complete operational success. The claw failed, he said, and only the sub's bow, with the bodies of six Russian sailors but no missiles or code equipment, was brought to the surface. The operation's secrecy was shattered after a June 1974 break-in at Hughes' Los Angeles headquarters, where the haul likely included a memo linking the mission to the billionaire. The circle within the government and law enforcement that knew of the project widened. The Los Angeles Times ran a story in February 1975. \\"The source of the leak was never identified,\\" the CIA said. \\"With Glomar's cover blown, the White House canceled further recovery operations.\\" The Glomar's mission has a Cold War postscript: In 1992, then-CIA Director Robert Gates gave Russian President Boris Yeltsin a decades-old video of the six sailors' burial at sea. A GLOMAR RESPONSE Converted to a deepwater drill ship in 1997 and renamed the GSF Explorer, the vessel was bought by Transocean in 2010 and has been deployed by the world's largest offshore driller from the Gulf of Mexico to Angola. Its stern has a helicopter landing pad and the vessel is topped by a towering 170-foot tall derrick, so it can drill to depths of up to 30,000 feet. In its heyday, the ship was hired out for more than 400,000 a day, could house a crew of 160 and was held steady for drilling in heavy seas by 11 powerful thrusters. But with falling oil prices approaching 40 a barrel and demand for exploration from companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP plunging, old ships without contracts or facing hefty maintenance bills are being culled. Transocean, whose Deepwater Horizon drill rig explosion in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history, condemned the GSF Explorer in April. Altogether, the company is scrapping some 20 vessels, shelving deliveries of new ultra-deepwater drillships, forecasting 2 billion in writedowns and cancelling its interim dividend. Houston's Diamond Offshore and London's Noble Corp have also consigned about a dozen ships to scrap since last year. \\"We've seen the largest number of floaters being scrapped over two consecutive years,\\" said Rystad Energy analyst Joachim Bjorni in Norway. But no \\"floater\\" destined for the world's scrap yards is quite like the GSF Explorer. Transocean declined to name the vessel's buyer, nor where it will be scrapped, fitting for a ship whose original name has become synonymous with U.S. government secrecy. After the CIA's initial refusal to acknowledge its \\"Project Azorian\\" in 1975 with a \\"neither confirm or deny\\" reply, such answers became know as \\"Glomar responses\\". (Editing by David Clarke) ||||| Output:","completion":"The Hughes Glomar Explorer, a ship secretly built by the CIA for a Cold War mission to raise a sunken Soviet submarine in 1974, is heading to the scrapyard due to falling oil prices. The vessel was eventually converted for oil drilling and became part of the Swiss company Transocean's fleet. However, the decline in oil prices has led Transocean to scrap the GSF Explorer, along with several other vessels. The ship, as the GSF Explorer, had been used for offshore drilling in locations from the Gulf of Mexico to Angola, but now joins around 40 other offshore drilling rigs consigned to scrap since last year."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Susan Magdalane Boyle (born 1 April 1961) is a Scottish singer who came to international attention when she appeared as a contestant on the TV programme Britain's Got Talent on 11 April 2009, singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables. Her first album, I Dreamed a Dream, was released in November 2009 and became the UK's best-selling debut album of all time, beating the previous record held by Spirit by Leona Lewis. I Dreamed a Dream set a record for biggest first week sales by a debut album, according to the Official Chart Company in the United Kingdom. In August 2008, Boyle applied for an audition for the third series of Britain's Got Talent (as contestant number 43212) and was accepted after a preliminary audition in Glasgow. When Boyle first appeared on Britain's Got Talent at the city's Clyde Auditorium, she said that she aspired to become a professional singer \\"as successful as Elaine Paige\\". Boyle sang \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" from Les Miserables in the first round, which was watched by over 10 million viewers when it aired on 11 April 2009. Programme judge Amanda Holden remarked upon the audience's initially cynical attitude, and the subsequent \\"biggest wake-up call ever\\" upon hearing her performance. Boyle was \\"absolutely gobsmacked\\" by the strength of the reaction to her appearance. Afterwards, Paige expressed interest in singing a duet with Boyle, and called her \\"a role model for everyone who has a dream\\". Boyle's rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" was credited with causing a surge in ticket sales in the Vancouver production of Les Miserables. Cameron Mackintosh, the producer of the musical, also praised the performance, as \\"heart-touching, thrilling and uplifting\\". Boyle was one of 40 acts that were put through to the semi-finals.

The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) became concerned by press reports about Boyle's erratic behaviour and speculation about her mental condition and wrote to remind editors about clause 3 (privacy) of their code of press conduct. The day after the final, Boyle was admitted to The Priory, a private psychiatric clinic in London, Talkback Thames explained, \\"Following Saturday night's show, Susan is exhausted and emotionally drained.\\" Her stay in hospital attracted widespread attention, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown wishing her well. Cowell offered to waive Boyle's contractual obligation to take part in the BGT tour. Her family said \\"she's been battered non-stop for the last seven weeks and it has taken its toll [...but...] her dream is very much alive,\\" as she had been invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the White House. Boyle left the clinic three days after her admission and said she would participate in the BGT tour. Despite health concerns, she appeared in 20 of the 24 dates of the tour, and was well received in cities including Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dublin, Sheffield, Coventry, and Birmingham.

(CNN)Lifelong runner and Austin Marathon race director John Conley has been a part of many races, but none of the finishes he's been a part of quite compare to what he saw Sunday in Texas. \\"What we saw was a champion,\\" Conley said. \\"The toughest person on the planet.\\" Conley's not talking about Cynthia Jerop, the women's winner, who finished the 26.2-mile race in 2:54:21. He'd expected to see Kenyan runner Hyvon Ngetich. According to reports he'd received from the race course, she had been leading most of the race. But with just two-tenths of a mile left to run, Ngetich began to wobble and stagger, and eventually fell down. She attempted to get back up and keep running but was unsuccessful, Conley said. Her \\"exceptional effort,\\" inspired applause from nearly every marathon spectator and inspired","completion":"Conley as well. Despite her faltering steps, Ngetich refused to give up, and with sheer determination, she began to crawl towards the finish line. As the crowd's cheers grew louder and more intense, volunteers and medical staff took notice and hovered nearby, ready to help her, but respecting her desire to finish the race on her own terms. With every agonizing inch, Ngetich displayed an inspiring level of grit and tenacity, her face etched with both pain and resolve. The spectators began to chant her name, their voices rising in a deafening roar, encouraging her to push past her limits. As the finish line came into sight, Ngetich gathered her remaining strength and managed to pull herself across the line, collapsing in a heap moments later. Medical staff immediately tended to her, providing care and ensuring her wellbeing. Despite not winning the race, her relentless spirit captivated the hearts of everyone in attendance. Ngetich ultimately placed third that day, but her courageous effort transcended the race results. Her story quickly gained international attention, making her a symbol of resilience and determination. John Conley recalled her performance as one of the most inspiring things he had ever witnessed in his career as a race director, and her story sparked conversations about the indomitable human spirit around the globe. In the weeks that followed, Ngetich's determination served as an inspiration not only for fellow athletes but for people from all walks of life who faced their own challenges. She was invited to schools, conferences, and interviews to share her experience and inspire others to tackle their own obstacles with a relentless spirit. Ngetich's story will forever be remembered as a powerful reminder that sometimes the greatest victories are not found in the act of winning, but in the courageous pursuit of a goal, regardless of how insurmountable it might seem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[+] Carrie had not polished their car..","completion":"The car of Kayla was more dull than that of Carrie because Kayla had not polished her car in quite a long time. Kayla had been extremely busy balancing work, school, and personal responsibilities. As a result, she simply couldn't find the spare time to give her car the attention it required to maintain a spotless and polished appearance. This was in stark contrast to Carrie, who devoted a chunk of her weekend routine to maintaining the pristine condition of her vehicle. Carrie was known to have a keen interest in cars in general, and she particularly took pride in maintaining the perfect aesthetics and performance of her own car. Every weekend, she would allocate several hours to properly wash, clean, and polish her car inside and out to ensure that it always looked its best. Furthermore, she would treat the leather seats with conditioner, vacuum the carpets, and even use air fresheners that added a pleasant scent to the car's interior. She enjoyed giving attention to every little detail that helped contribute to the car's immaculate appearance. In addition to their dedication to their vehicles, the two friends also had different preferences when it came to the brands and models of the cars they owned. Kayla owned a reliable, fuel-efficient sedan that served as her daily driver. It was functional and practical, but didn't necessarily have the glamour factor or performance to rival some of the more luxurious and sporty car models. Carrie, on the other hand, was fascinated by sports cars and had managed to save up enough to treat herself to a sleek, high-performance coupe. Its elegantly designed exterior, coupled with the luxurious interior, commanded attention and admiration from everyone who saw it. The glossy paintwork accentuated the car's curves and added an extra layer of sparkle in the sunlight. However, it was important to understand that both Kayla and Carrie had their reasons and priorities when it came to their respective vehicles. Kayla focused on the practicality and fuel efficiency of her car, which allowed her to handle her busy schedule without the added stress of worrying about potential automotive issues or spending more money on fuel. Carrie derived great pleasure from owning a car that, to her, represented success and her passion for automobiles, and this motivated her to invest the extra time and effort to keep it looking flawless. Therefore, it can be concluded that the car of Kayla was more dull than that of Carrie because Kayla had not polished her car for a significant amount of time. The difference in their vehicles' appearances was primarily due to their contrasting interests and routines. While Kayla prioritized convenience and functionality, Carrie took great pride in the aesthetics of her car and consistently devoted time and effort towards maintaining its polished and pristine appearance."},{"prompt":"Pick one category for the following text.

Jose Mourinho believes Fernando Torres needed a 'change of scenery' from Chelsea, but the Portuguese would have preferred if the Spain striker had moved to Inter Milan rather than AC Milan. Torres agreed a two-year loan move to Milan - and not Mourinho's former team Inter - after a challenging three-and-a-half-years at Stamford Bridge following his £50million arrival from Liverpool in January 2011. 'I'm an Interista and I would have preferred if he'd gone to Inter,' Chelsea boss Mourinho told reporters at a UEFA coaching seminar in Nyon.

Despite his struggles at Chelsea, Torres was still revered in the footballing world for his talent and past successes with both Liverpool and the Spanish national team. As the season unfolds, Torres finds a new lease on life at AC Milan. Under the guidance of manager Filippo Inzaghi, the Spanish forward rediscovers his goal-scoring touch. The partnership between Torres and fellow forward, Carlos Bacca, proves to be a potent combination in Serie A, with the duo leading AC Milan to a resurgence in both domestic and European competitions. Back in West London, Jose Mourinho remains focused on his Chelsea squad. Despite the loss of Torres, Mourinho makes several key signings, strengthening the team and leading them to another Premier League title. The rivalry between the two Milan clubs intensifies, as Inter Milan and AC Milan battle for the top spots in Serie A. Mourinho, an Inter Milan supporter, pays close attention while his admiration for his former striker Torres only grows. The following season, rumours of a potential reunion between Mourinho and Torres in Italy begin to circulate. Inter Milan, managed by Antonio Conte, are in need of a new forward, and the prospect of bringing Torres to the club entices them. After a successful time with AC Milan, Torres decides it's time for a new challenge and agrees to join forces with his former coach, Mourinho, at Inter Milan. Reunited, the duo picks up right where they left off. Torres, invigorated by the fresh start in Milan, continues his excellent form, and Mourinho's tactical prowess propels Inter Milan to new heights. The team dominates Serie A and captures their first Scudetto in over a decade. Additionally, Inter Milan embarks on a remarkable run in the Champions League, making it to the final. In an incredible twist of fate, the UEFA Champions League final pits Inter Milan against Chelsea, setting the stage for an epic battle between Torres and his former team. Both sides display immense talent, heart, and desire, leading to a fiercely contested match. As the game heads into the final minutes, the score remains deadlocked at 1-1. Then, in the 89th minute, a moment of magic unfolds. Torres, with the ball at his feet, makes an exceptional run towards Chelsea's goal, evading multiple defenders in the process. Displaying the skills that once made him one of the world's most feared strikers, Torres unleashes a thunderous shot that sails past the Chelsea goalkeeper, finding the back of the net. The Inter Milan fans erupt in jubilation, and Jose Mourinho stands on the sideline, beaming with pride at the sight of his former protege shining on the biggest stage. This moment solidifies Fernando Torres's place as a legend in the history of Inter Milan and reestablishes his status as one of the world's premier footballers.

Hey kids, do you know that whistling is not just fun and a way to make music, but it can also help babies learn faster? A study of Vietnamese families found out that using whistling can help babies get out of their nappies or diapers by the time they are just nine months old! Isn't that amazing? Well, let me explain how it works. The parents in these Vietnamese families use little special sounds, like a whistle, when their babies need to go potty. This whistle is like a secret signal that tells the baby that it's time to go pee or poo. The babies then start to understand this signal, and they learn to go potty all by themselves without needing a diaper. So what does this mean for babies and their families? It means that these little ones can be more independent and grow up faster. They also don't need as many diapers, which is good for the environment and helps families save money too. In conclusion, the study about Vietnamese families and whistling shows that this simple and joyful sound can do wonders for babies. Just like music can make us happy, a little whistle can help babies learn important skills and make life easier for everyone!

(Associated Press) The parents of one of the 20 first-graders killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre met with the gunman's father for more than an hour in an effort to bring some closure to the tragedy, asking him about his son's mental health and other issues. Alissa Parker told \\"CBS This Morning\\" in an excerpt of an interview that aired Thursday the meeting with Adam Lanza's father, Peter Lanza, was her idea. Her 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, died in December's shooting rampage. \\"I felt strongly that I needed to tell him something, and I needed to get that out of my system,\\" Alissa Parker said. \\"I felt very motivated to do it and then I felt really good about it and prayed about it. And it was something that I needed to do.\\" It was unclear what they discussed or when the meeting took place. CBS plans to show the rest of the interview with Alissa and Robbie Parker on Friday morning, revealing more details about their meeting with Peter Lanza. No one answered the phone at the Parkers' home Thursday morning. A message seeking comment from Peter Lanza was left with a Lanza family spokesman. The Parkers told CBS they wanted to ask Peter Lanza about his son's medical history, his and his ex-wife's relationships with Adam Lanza and other issues. Robbie Parker was the first parent of a child killed at the school to speak publicly about the massacre. A day after the Dec. 14 killings, he fought back tears and struggled to catch his breath as he spoke lovingly of Emilie at a wrenching, lengthy news conference. \\"She was beautiful. She was blond. She was always smiling,\\" he said, adding that the world was a better place because Emilie was in it. \\"I'm so blessed to be her dad.\\" Adam Lanza, 20, shot 20 children and six educators to death at the school and killed himself as police arrived. He also fatally shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, at their Newtown home before going to the school. Peter Lanza, who was divorced from Nancy Lanza, said in a statement after the killings that his family also was asking why Adam Lanza would go on a shooting spree. People close to the investigation have told The Associated Press that Adam Lanza showed interest in other mass killers. ||||| Newtown victim's parents talk about meeting killer Adam Lanza's father (CBS News) Vice President Biden and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg are expected to meet with the families of Newtown school shooting victims on Thursday, over three months after the massacre took place in Connecticut. Ahead of the meeting, CBS This Morning's Norah O'Donnell spoke with Robbie and Alissa Parker, the parents of six-year-old victim Emilie Parker. They revealed that they recently met with the father of gunman Adam Lanza as part of their search for understanding and grieving process. The meeting \\"was kind of my doing,\\" Alissa Parker explained. \\"I guess the reason why I felt strongly that I needed to tell [Peter Lanza] something. And I needed to get that out of my system. I felt very motivated to do it and ... I felt really good about it, I prayed about it, and it was something that I needed to do. Robbie added their family has experienced \\"a little bit of everything,\\" as they've dealt with the scope of the tragedy over the past three months. \\"You know, you went from the absolute worst experience that you could ever imagine to have to go through as a parent ... and being overwhelmed with that sense of grief and loss to, on the other end of the spectrum, you're being completely overwhelmed with outpouring of love and support from so many people and everything that kinda falls in between,\\" he said. The Parkers addressed the recent news that Newtown investigators determined that Adam Lanza kept a spreadsheet methodically detailing the death toll of other mass shooters, types of weaponry, and plotted how he would add to the death tolls. \\"Any information ... that you gain in this experience is just that. It's information,\\" Robbie said. \\"And then you have to choose how you're gonna handle it. And so for us, we've decided that what works best for us is you receive a bit of information, you process it, you feel the emotion that comes along with it, and then you have to let it go.\\" Alissa added, \\"It's just like another piece to the puzzle. And it always brings with it a period of, you know, sorrow, pain, and you deal with it and you just move on. The outcome is still the same, regardless if it was planned, not planned.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The surgeon will provide you with specific instructions that begin as early as two weeks before your surgery. Some instructions deal with safe practices to avoid unwanted medical events during and following your surgery. Other instructions help your body prepare for the surgery and the healing process afterwards, including steps to help reduce swelling. Every surgery, every surgeon, and every patient are different. The swelling that occurs will depend on many variables. Pay attention to the instructions provided by your surgeon to reduce swelling. Be very clear, well in advance of your surgery, regarding the changes you need to make in your medications. This will involve a coordinated effort with your regular doctor, any specialists you see, and your surgeon. Some medications can cause changes that may lead to problems during surgery and difficulties after the surgery, such as additional and prolonged swelling. Make the changes in your prescription drugs, over-the-counter agents, and herbal supplements, two weeks before your surgery. It takes time for the medications to get out of your system, and for your system to return to its baseline level of functioning. Provide your surgeon with a complete list of your medications, including herbal supplements and over-the-counter agents, at least 30 days before your scheduled surgery. It takes time for your doctors to communicate with each other and determine the drugs you can stop in advance and the ones you should not stop at all. Never stop or adjust your prescription medications without consulting your doctor. Plan early with your regular doctor or specialist. Many agents require a gradual taper downward to stop the medication. Some prescription medications should not be stopped or dose adjusted at all. Let your surgeon know of the drugs you will need to continue to take routinely, including the day of surgery. Your surgeon will know if you can continue some agents, such as acetaminophen. You will need to stop many things but not everything. Your surgeon will let you know what you can continue taking. OTC anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, will need to be discontinued two weeks before your surgery. This group of medications can lead to additional bleeding which causes more swelling. Stop taking your herbal supplements should be stopped two to three weeks before your surgery. It may be best to plan on stopping everything you take that is an herbal product or supplement. Your surgeon will tell you exactly how to proceed. Some herbal products can interfere with anesthesia and others can increase bleeding and swelling after the procedure. Plan on stopping products that contain omega 3’s and 6’s contained in fish oil supplements, flaxseed, ephedra, Ma Huang, feverfew, goldenseal, garlic, ginseng, ginger, licorice, valerian, and kava. This is not a complete list. Talk to your surgeon about all your herbal supplements. A healthy diet will promote healing and reduce swelling. This means you should start following this step as far in advance as possible and continue it through the entire post-op healing process. Include fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber. Examples of high fiber foods include peas, lentils, artichokes, brussel sprouts, lima beans, and black beans. High fiber foods prevent constipation. Pain medications provided for surgical pain often cause constipation. Straining due to constipation can lead to bleeding at the surgical site and additional swelling. Reduce your sodium intake to help decrease swelling after the surgery. Stay hydrated the week leading up to the surgery. Plenty of water will also help to promote healing and reduce swelling. If you are a smoker, then you will need to stop smoking several weeks before your surgery. The healing process is slowed in people that smoke. Smoking also increases the risk of developing an infection. Avoid ingesting alcoholic drinks. Since alcohol thins the blood, avoid drinking alcohol for at least five days before the surgery. Summary:","completion":"In summary, to reduce swelling before and after surgery, follow your surgeon's specific instructions. This may include adjusting medications in coordination with your regular doctor, ceasing over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, and stopping herbal supplements. Maintain a healthy, high-fiber diet and stay hydrated leading up to the surgery. If you smoke, quit several weeks before the operation and avoid alcohol consumption for at least five days pre-surgery.

Movie title: The Thing Movie plot: A United States Air Force crew is dispatched by General Fogerty (David McMahon) from Anchorage, Alaska at the request of Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the chief scientist of a North Pole scientific outpost. They have evidence that an unknown flying craft crashed in their vicinity, so Reporter Ned Scott (Douglas Spencer) tags along for the story. Dr. Carrington later briefs Captain Hendry (Kenneth Tobey) and his airmen, and Dr. Redding (George Fenneman) shows photos of a flying object moving erratically before crashing; not the movements of a meteorite. Following erratic magnetic pole anomalies, the crew and scientists fly to the crash site aboard the team's C-47. The mysterious craft lies buried beneath refrozen ice, with just the tip of a rounded airfoil protruding from the surface. As they outline the craft's general shape, they realize they are standing in a circle: they have discovered a crashed flying saucer. They try deicing the buried craft with thermite heat bombs, but only ignite its metal alloy, causing an explosion that destroys the saucer. Their Geiger counter then points to a slightly radioactive frozen shape buried nearby in the refrozen ice. They excavate a large block of ice around what appears to be a tall body and fly it to the research outpost, just as a major storm moves in, cutting off their communications with Anchorage. Some of the scientists want to thaw out the body, but Captain Hendry issues orders for everyone to wait until he receives further instructions from the Air Force. Later, Corporal Barnes (William Self) takes the second watch over the ice block and to avoid looking at the body within, covers it with an electric blanket that the previous guard left turned on. As the ice slowly melts, the Thing inside revives; Barnes panics and begins shooting at it with his .45 caliber sidearm, but the alien escapes into the sub-zero cold of the raging storm.

Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment.

April is believed dead after being crushed by the wreckage of the space shuttle. Tech mogul Aston Reynolds (based on Tesla, Inc. co-founder and SpaceX founder Elon Musk) has developed a new type of high-speed space travel with his company Astro-X (a play on SpaceX), which was used to save Fin's father, Colonel Gilbert Shepard, from the moon. Astro-X has also developed a technology that is capable of using radio waves to diffuse tornadoes, leading to the end of the sharknado phenomenon.

We can do this by imagining we have 1,248 candies but need to take away 1,678 candies. So we take away the candies, and we're left with: 1248 - 1678 = -430 candies 3. Now, our problem looks like this: 5879 = 701*c - 430 4. To continue solving for \\"c\\", we need to move the -430 candies to the other side of the equal sign. To do so, we'll add 430 candies to both sides: 5879 + 430 = 701*c - 430 + 430 5. Now we simplify: 6309 = 701*c 6. To find out what \\"c\\" is, we have to divide 6,309 candies by 701: c = 6309 / 701 7. Once we divide, we find out that \\"c\\" equals to 9 (approximately).

The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \\"commonsense\\" move. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday. In a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted. Republicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department. \\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.

SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor.

As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years.

These accusations have been circulating in both local and international media, bringing the credibility of the Karzai family and their political influence in Afghanistan into question. Background Afghanistan has long been suffering from the issue of illegal drug production and supply, with opium being one of its major exports. According to UN reports, Afghanistan produces approximately 90% of the world's illegal opium, representing an important part of the country's economy and a major source of income for the Taliban and other militant groups. These groups are said to use the profits from drug trade to fund insurgency activities against the Afghan government and international forces in the region. Ahmed Wali Karzai's Alleged Ties to Drug Trafficking Ahmed Wali Karzai, the younger brother of Hamid Karzai, has been accused of having ties to the drug trade on numerous occasions. Some reports have even alleged that he has profited from this trade in his capacity as a key political figure and leader in southern Afghanistan. The allegations of Ahmed Wali Karzai's involvement in the illegal drugs business have not only raised questions about the integrity of the entire Karzai family but have also severely impacted the image of Afghanistan and its political leadership in the eyes of the international community. Denials by Ahmed Wali Karzai In response to these accusations, Ahmed Wali Karzai has categorically denied any links to the drug trade, stating that these allegations are false and baseless. He emphasizes that he has been fighting against terrorism and drug-related activities alongside Afghan and international security forces. Moreover, Ahmed Wali Karzai argues that such rumours are part of a broader conspiracy to undermine his family's political standing in the country and to discredit their contributions in the post-Taliban era. He contends that these allegations are being propagated by his enemies in order to tarnish the image of the Karzai family and negatively impact the legacy of his brother's presidency. International Response Several international governments and organizations have been closely monitoring the situation in Afghanistan and the allegations against Ahmed Wali Karzai. While some have called for a thorough investigation into these claims in order to establish the truth, others have expressed concern regarding the impact this could have on the fragile political stability in the country. Moving Forward Accurately assessing and addressing the extent of the involvement of political figures like Ahmed Wali Karzai in the drug trade is crucial for the ongoing battle against Afghanistan's illicit drug industry. A transparent and unbiased investigation would be instrumental in clearing the air on such allegations and ensuring that the country's leaders remain dedicated to combating the menace of drug trafficking. It is equally important for the Afghan government to demonstrate its commitment to fighting drug-related issues and ensuring political leaders are held accountable for any involvement in such activities. This will not only help in restoring confidence in the nation's political system but will also strengthen the international community's support for ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide more details based on the context given, the subdued forecasts for holiday sales in the US have been largely asserted due to various factors. This could include potential reasons such as the ongoing global pandemic, economic unrest, or shifts in consumer spending habits, where more consumers might lean towards saving or investing their money rather than spending broadly on holiday shopping. However, despite these conservative forecasts, it is clear that Apple Computer's store in San Francisco has been experiencing an opposite trend. The store was reportedly filled with a large number of shoppers last week. This could signify that, irrespective of the general expectations, some brands or products, like Apple Computers, continue to maintain their appeal amongst customers during the festive shopping spree. One possibility behind this continued consumer interest in Apple products could be due to the robust brand loyalty Apple has fostered over the years. Alternatively, it could be driven by new product releases or attractive holiday deals offered by Apple that are enticing customers to visit their stores, subverting the overall muted outlook on holiday sales this year. Given the flux of shoppers at Apple's store, it illustrates that while general market trends might indicate a subdued retail environment, individual stores, products, or categories can still perform robustly depending on their specific circumstances, offerings, and customer appeal. It clearly demonstrates that consumer behavior can often be multifaceted and not always adherent to broader market trends or predictions. This situation could prompt businesses and market analysts to revisit their strategies or forecasts, taking into account these micro-level discrepancies in consumer behavior."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The proposition suggests the option of all-black, all-male schools which are publicly funded in order to directly address the needs of African-American male students in modern society. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"The proposition for establishing all-black, all-male public schools is one that seeks to address the often unique challenges faced by African-American male students in the modern educational system. There are several aspects of research and evidence which can be cited to support this claim, including the importance of role models, the potential for fewer racial biases, a targeted curriculum, improved peer relationships, and better academic outcomes. 1. Importance of Role Models: Studies have shown that having positive role models who share similar cultural, racial, and gender experiences can significantly influence the self-esteem and aspirations of students, especially young African-American males. In all-black, all-male schools, educators can specifically recruit teachers who reflect the student population, thus providing relatable role models to inspire and guide students on a personal level. 2. Reduced Racial Biases: In a school environment where the majority of students and teachers are African American males, the potential for racial biases or microaggressions can be significantly reduced. This safe school climate can create a more supportive educational environment and foster a sense of belonging among students. Furthermore, it can also help alleviate the racial disparities in disciplinary actions, such as suspensions and expulsions, that disproportionately target African American male students. 3. Targeted Curriculum: All-black, all-male schools can offer a curriculum that is uniquely tailored to the needs and interests of African American male students, not only in terms of content but also in instructional and assessment methods. Schools can incorporate an Afrocentric curriculum that promotes cultural awareness, instills pride in their heritage, and integrates material relevant to their lives and experiences. This may include supplemental texts that focus on African American history and literature, as well as instruction in coping mechanisms and important life skills to navigate the wider society. 4. Improved Peer Relationships: Students in all-black, all-male schools are likely to form stronger bonds and support networks with their peers than in diverse school settings. As students share similar cultural backgrounds and life experiences, fewer social and cultural barriers exist to inhibit relationship building. Collective peer support is crucial for addressing self-esteem, sense of belonging, and resilience, contributing to improved mental well-being among African American male students. 5. Better Academic Outcomes: Establishing all-black, all-male schools could lead to better academic and developmental outcomes for African American male students. While empirical data on the success of all-black, all-male schools is still relatively limited, there have been some promising findings in recent years. For example, the Urban Prep Academies in Chicago, an all-black, all-male charter school network, has seen a consistent record of 100% college acceptance rates for their graduating students since 2010. This success can provide a strong foundation for building more such schools. In conclusion, the establishment of publicly funded all-black, all-male schools has the potential to address the unique challenges faced by African American male students in the contemporary educational system. By creating an environment that fosters mentorship, reduces racial biases, provides a targeted curriculum, enhances peer relationships, and ultimately leads to better academic outcomes, these schools can be instrumental in empowering young African American men to succeed, both academically and personally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can do this with an electric drill with a paint paddle attachment if the paint has been sitting in storage for a while, or simply give it a stir if you’re just bringing it home. The better the paint is mixed, the smoother coverage it will create. Oil based paints may separate more than other varieties. Do your blending outside and set down a few sheets of newspaper or cardboard to protect from splatters. Paint cracks, crevices and other hard to reach spaces first, using a brush to give you greater control. Afterwards, go over flat, broad surfaces using a dense foam roller. Let the initial coat set up for a couple of hours before applying subsequent coats. Don’t worry too much about making the first coat flawless. You can cover up any visible imperfections with later coats. Most cabinets will require two to three coats for a seamless finish. For the final coat, use a steady hand and a consistent brushing pattern. Watch out for drips, as these can permanently settle into the complete finish once it dries. When you’re done, the your cabinets should have a rich, uniform appearance. Use your best judgment after applying the base coat to decide how many follow-up coats will be necessary. Many new types of paint are self-leveling, which means they won’t run or clot as easily. Working with these paints can save you a lot of frustration in achieving the perfect finish, as well as additional mess during cleanup. The paint will dry to the touch within 24-48 hours, though it may take up to a week for it to harden to the point that it becomes resistant to scuffs and other marks. Leave the doors open to provide air flow. Keep small children and pets away from wet paint as it dries. Leaving the fan running in the bathroom may help the paint set up at a faster rate.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose crust is pushed upward happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, which suggests that the crust is pushed upward, could indeed have an effect on the frequency and size of volcanic eruptions, both directly and indirectly. If the crust is pushed upward, it can lead to changes in the underlying pressure systems and the movement of magma beneath the Earth's surface. This can result in either smaller eruptions or even a decrease in eruption frequency. Direct effects: 1. Changes in magma movement: If the crust is pushed upward, the pressure beneath the Earth's surface might get altered, leading to changes in the movement of magma. This could potentially result in shallower chambers being formed. Consequently, lesser pressure would be required to produce smaller eruptions. 2. Crust deformation: The upward movement of the crust could lead to structural transformations in the Earth's surface, which in turn could create new pathways for magma to move and escape through. This could mean that smaller amounts of magma may reach the surface, leading to smaller eruptions. Indirect effects: 1. Tectonic stress: The perturbation might result in changes in tectonic forces and stresses, which could directly affect the occurrence of volcanic eruptions. The greater the tectonic stress, the greater the likelihood of volcanic eruptions. If the crust being pushed upward leads to a reduction in tectonic stresses, this could reduce the likelihood of eruptions, potentially leading to fewer and smaller eruptions. 2. Change in subsurface conditions: The upward movement of crust could also change geothermal conditions, such as temperature and pressure, in the subsurface. This could affect the amount of magma generated or the rate at which it ascends towards the surface. Consequently, this could lead to smaller or less frequent eruptions. It is important to note that the impacts mentioned above are speculative, and the actual outcomes would depend on various factors, such as the extent of the perturbation, the composition of the crust and magma, and the geodynamic setting of the region.

Question: Anna was saved by Lewis because? Movie title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Question: \\"Which is not a disease: TB, NDM-1, or MDR-TB?\\" Context: \\"Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as \\"superbugs\\", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, NDM-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency has stated that \\"most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.\\"\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"From the given context and question - TB, NDM-1, or MDR-TB - the one that is not a disease is NDM-1. To explain further, let's understand each term and its implication: 1. Tuberculosis (TB): TB is a contagious and potentially severe bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the spine and brain. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB was a major health concern in the past, and due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, it is increasingly becoming a significant global health issue today. 2. Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB): MDR-TB is a specific form of tuberculosis that is resistant to at least two of the main first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. This resistance to conventional treatments results in a more severe and challenging form of tuberculosis. MDR-TB requires a longer duration of treatment and the use of more toxic, less effective drugs compared to standard TB therapy. The increasing prevalence of MDR-TB further complicates the global fight against tuberculosis and poses a significant public health challenge. 3. NDM-1: NDM-1, which stands for New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1, is an enzyme that confers bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials. It is present in certain bacteria, making them resistant to a wide array of antibiotics, including carbapenems - a group of 'last resort' antibiotics used for treating severe infections. The presence of NDM-1 in bacteria makes it extremely difficult to treat infections caused by these resistant strains, as they are no longer effectively killed or inhibited by standard antibiotics. However, NDM-1 is not a disease; it is an enzyme that gives bacteria the ability to evade common antibiotic treatments, resulting in hard-to-treat infections. While TB and MDR-TB are diseases caused by bacteria, NDM-1 is an enzyme found in certain bacteria that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Thus, NDM-1 is not a disease itself but plays a significant role in the emergence and persistence of antibiotic-resistant infections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Process: - The kidneys receive blood through the renal artery - The blood is passed through the nephrons in the kidneys - The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine. Question: suppose lesser greenhouse effect happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step and assess if there is a connection between the greenhouse effect and waste removal by the kidneys. 1. The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat and warm the planet. A lesser greenhouse effect would mean less heat being trapped and potentially a cooler planet. 2. The kidneys are responsible for removing waste from the body and regulating the balance of fluids and electrolytes within the body. The process of waste removal is largely independent of external environmental factors like the greenhouse effect. Now, let's examine the potential relationship between a lesser greenhouse effect and waste removal from the body. After assessing the processes involved in both phenomena, it's clear that the greenhouse effect influences global temperature, and kidney function is largely an internal biological process. There is no direct relationship between greenhouse effect perturbations and the waste removal capacity of kidneys. So, the answer to the question would be: A: No effect The lesser greenhouse effect will have no effect on the waste being removed from the body since these processes are unrelated and function independently of each other."}]`),H={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],N={key:0},q={key:1};function E(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
