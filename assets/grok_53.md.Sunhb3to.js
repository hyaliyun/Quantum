My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore). This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family.

Q:Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Of the new planets, which one has more trapped terrestrial radiation? Two new planets have just been discovered in our solar system. Scientists have just landed on both and are in the process of analyzing the environment and atmosphere of each planet. What is immediately apparent is that both planets are remarkably similar to Earth since both are oxygen rich and do not require a space suit to breathe. Another similarity that one of the planets, Jarthrow, has with Earth is that it naturally outputs approximately the same amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as Earth does. The other planet, Millhouse, outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases. Climate scientists are rushing to try to see if anything new can be discovered to help out our planet with these new discoveries. Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. A:","completion":"Millhouse has more trapped terrestrial radiation because it outputs about twice as many greenhouse gases compared to Jarthrow and Earth. Since greenhouse gases partially absorb longer wavelengths of terrestrial radiation, an increase in greenhouse gases leads to an increase in trapped terrestrial radiation, causing higher global temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His shocked father (Thengai Srinivasan) enlists a charming press reporter, Rekha (Radhika Sarathkumar) to change him back to normal. She sets up a number of things such as an interview, which he thwarts.Later, on the pretense of taking him to a temple, she plans another set up. On the way to the temple, she pretends that the car has broken down and he leaves to roam around a bit. While he is walking he sees a crying child and offers him a chocolate. Suddenly he is swarmed by more children and other villagers who confront him of being a child-kidnapper. Using the event, Rekha cut's Arun's beard off, a symbol of piety. After a few more set-ups such as this, he renounces his sainthood.Later, Arun goes to work and finds out that his father has been sending money to someone for over twenty years.In another scenario, a man informs a lady that someone has proposed to her nephew John (again Rajinikanth). She informs the bride's parents about John, telling them he is actually a man named Alex Pandian's (also portrayed by Rajinikanth) son.A flashback ensues that explains Alex Pandian's story. Alex Pandian is a scrupulous police officer. He arrests some criminals and brings upon him the wrath of their mob boss, Egambaram (Senthamarai). Egambaram kills him and as he exhales his last breadth, Alex Pandian vows that he will be born again to take revenge.When Alex Pandian dies so does his wife after giving birth to twins.

It provides hints towards the initial part of the plot where he changes his way of living and becomes a saint. This part of the title allows room for interpretation, engaging the curiosity of potential viewers. The second part \\"The Pandian Legacy\\" indicates the recurring role of character Alex Pandian, who perceivably sets the tone for the rest of the plot even after his demise. The term \\"Legacy\\" points to the persistence of Alex Pandian's spirit and principles in his sons John and Arun, who progressively reveal their ties to their father's identity. Additionally, it suggests the intertwined fates and Karmic justice that the twins (Arun and John) indirectly deliver, affirming their father's vowed retribution against his murderer. Together, these components capture the primary themes of transformation, family secrets, and revenge in the plot.

You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task, you are given two strings A, B. Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. JdEKNd, eUEKea Output:","completion":"To find the longest common substring in the strings A and B, I will follow these steps: 1. I will create a matrix 'dp', where dp[i][j] represents the length of the common suffix of substrings A[0..i] and B[0..j]. 2. I will initialize the first row and first column of 'dp' with 0, as an empty substring has no characters in common. 3. I will iterate through both strings and compare characters at respective indices. 4. If characters at indices i and j are the same (A[i] == B[j]), I will update the value in the matrix as dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. This is because the common suffix increases by one character. 5. If characters at indices i and j are different (A[i] != B[j]), I will update the value in the matrix as dp[i][j] = 0, as a new common suffix starts here. 6. During the process, I will also keep track of the maximum value in the matrix and its position, as they determine the length and starting point of the longest common substring. 7. Once the matrix is completely filled, I will extract the longest common substring using the maximum value and its position. Here is a step-by-step process for the given input: Input: A = \\"JdEKNd\\" B = \\"eUEKea\\" Step 1: Create a matrix 'dp' dp = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ] Step 2: Initialize the first row and first column with 0 The matrix is already initialized with 0 in the first row and the first column. Step 3-5: Iterate through the strings and fill the matrix For example, when i = 2 and j = 5: A[2] = \\"E\\" B[5] = \\"e\\" Since they are not equal, dp[2][5] = 0. When i = 4 and j = 3: A[4] = \\"K\\" B[3] = \\"K\\" Since they are equal, dp[4][3] = dp[3][2] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. The resulting matrix after filling all values will be: dp = [ [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0] ] Step 6: Find the maximum value and its position in the matrix The maximum value is 2, located at position (6, 3), meaning that the longest common substring has a length of 2 and ends at index 3 of string B. Step 7: Extract the longest common substring Extract the substring using the maximum value and its position. In this case, B[3-2+1:3+1] = B[2:4] = \\"EK\\".

Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus.

Aretha Louise Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, to Barbara (nee Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn \\"C. L.\\" Franklin. Her father was an itinerant preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist. Alongside Franklin, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to Buffalo, New York when Franklin was two. Franklin dealt with weight issues for years. In 1974, she dropped 40 pounds (18 kg) during a crash diet and maintained her new weight until the end of the decade. Franklin again lost the weight in the early 1990s before gaining some back. A former chain smoker who struggled with alcoholism, she quit smoking in 1992. Franklin admitted in 1994 that her smoking was \\"messing with my voice\\", but after quitting smoking she said later, in 2003, that her weight \\"ballooned\\". In 2010, Franklin canceled a number of concerts after she decided to have surgery for an undisclosed tumor. Discussing the surgery in 2011, she quoted her doctor as saying it would \\"add 15 to 20 years\\" to her life. She denied that the ailment had anything to do with pancreatic cancer, as it was rumored. On May 19, 2011, Franklin had her comeback show in the Chicago theatre. In May 2013, Franklin canceled two performances to deal with an undisclosed medical treatment. Later in the same month, Franklin canceled three more concerts in June and planned to return to perform in July. However, a show of July 27 in Clarkston, Michigan was canceled due to continued medical treatment. In addition, Franklin canceled an appearance at an MLB luncheon in Chicago honoring her commitment to civil rights on an August 24 date. She also canceled a performance of September 21 in Atlanta due to her health recovery. During a phone interview with The Associated Press in late August 2013 Franklin stated that she had a \\"miraculous\\" recovery from her undisclosed illness but had to cancel shows and appearances until she was at 100% health, stating she was \\"85% healed\\". Franklin has since returned to live performing, including a 2013 Christmas concert at Detroit's Motor City Casino. She launched a multi-city tour beginning the summer of 2014, starting with a performance of June 14 in New York at the Radio City Music Hall. In 2017, Franklin canceled a series of concerts due to health reasons. During an outdoors Detroit show, Franklin told the audience to \\"keep me in your prayers\\". In July 2017, Franklin reemerged, appearing to lose more weight before a performance at the Wolf Trap in Virginia.","completion":"This text is about Aretha Louise Franklin, an American singer, songwriter, and pianist who was born in Memphis, Tennessee.

The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City.

Choices: [i] no [ii] yes","completion":"The word \\"kudos\\" has an interesting origin, with roots in ancient Greece. To understand the etymology and history of this term, we need to delve into its various aspects. The term \\"kudos\\" comes from the Greek word \\"κῦδος\\" (kŷdos), which means 'praise' or 'glory.' In ancient Greek culture, recognition and praise for one's actions or accomplishments were essential to maintaining social status and honor. In this competitive environment, individuals sought kudos in various ways, such as through bravery in combat, artistic achievements, or athletic prowess. Over time, the concept of kudos spread beyond ancient Greece through the expansion of their language and culture. The term started to make its way into English in the early 19th century, when it was borrowed as a slang term for acclaim or praise. By the mid-19th century, it had gained more widespread usage among English-speaking communities, especially in Britain and its colonies. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, the term became increasingly popular in American English, where it eventually adopted a more colloquial and casual connotation. The modern usage of \\"kudos\\" in English is similar in meaning to its ancient Greek roots, referring to the praise, recognition, or honor given to someone for their achievements or accomplishments. Today, we often use it to express admiration, approval, or congratulations. Regarding the two questions mentioned: 1. \\"Where did the word 'kudos' come from?\\" 2. \\"Where does the term kudos come from?\\" These questions essentially have the same meaning as they both inquire about the origin of the term \\"kudos.\\" Despite the slightly different phrasing, both questions aim to understand the history and etymology of this word.

What is the sentiment of the following review? Another one of my favorite buffets!!! No, it's not on the strip. Yes, it's at the M Resort... Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance. Totally worth it. Along with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol So at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week. There's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain. I never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this. There's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though.

Q: Passage: On November 4, an extratropical disturbance was spawned just off the coast of western France, within a cold front, by another extratropical cyclone to the north, named \\"Quinn.\\" This storm began causing heavy rainfall in northern Italy, leading to flooding in the region. On the next day, a low-pressure area formed over western France, and the system was named Rolf by the Free University of Berlin, which names all significant low pressure systems affecting Europe. As the storm slowly moved eastward, it caused flooding in the Balearic Islands. Rolf gradually organized, and convection began to increase in the storm. Over the next couple of days, the storm continued to organize as it moved eastward, approaching the northwestern coast of Italy. On November 5, Rolf's forward motion slowed while the storm was stationed above the Massif Central in southern France, maintaining a central pressure of . On November 6, the system moved into the western Mediterranean Sea and stalled off the coast of Liguria, while gradually strengthening, bringing additional flooding to the region. Around the same time, the storm's frontal structure shrunk to in length. During that evening, Rolf spawned a tornado over Alassio, in northern Italy, causing some structural damage. On November 7, 2011, Rolf turned westward and slowly transitioned from an extratropical system into a subtropical depression over the warm waters of the Mediterranean Sea, with the system acquiring a warm quasi-symmetric core, and with organized convective rainbands wrapping around the center of the storm. The storm was then given the designation Invest 99L, by the United States Naval Research Laboratory (the NRL). The NOAA also began watching the subtropical depression, which was now located in the Gulf of Lion. Later that day, Rolf transitioned from a subtropical depression into a tropical depression off the coast of France, and the NOAA gave Rolf the identifier 01M.

Please add spaces between words: OkawasalsointerestedinJapanesepoetryandZenphilosophy.","completion":"Okawa was also interested in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy. Okawa was a unique individual who had a strong passion for various aspects of Japanese culture. This blend of interests made Okawa a well-rounded individual who could appreciate the depth and beauty of both literature and the spiritual world. Japanese poetry has a long and rich history, with several forms such as haiku, tanka, and renga. As a lover of Japanese poetry, Okawa must have been fascinated with how poets were able to capture the essence of nature, emotions, and human experiences in such concise and profound ways. Japanese poetry often relies on simple language and evokes powerful imagery through subtle metaphors and allusions. Haiku, for example, is a traditional form of Japanese poetry comprising just three lines with a syllabic structure of 5-7-5. Despite its brevity, a good haiku can encapsulate the emotions or feelings of a particular moment or scene in nature. Okawa would have admired the mastery of this form by renowned poets like Matsuo Basho, Yosa Buson, and Kobayashi Issa. Zen philosophy, on the other hand, is a strand of Buddhism that originated in China and later spread to Japan. It emphasizes mindfulness, meditation, and the attainment of enlightenment through direct experience and intuitive understanding. Okawa's interest in Zen philosophy suggests a deep curiosity about spiritual growth, self-awareness, and the nature of reality. Some of the essential aspects of Zen philosophy include zazen (sitting meditation), koans (paradoxical questions or statements to provoke enlightenment), and the appreciation of the impermanent nature of life. Okawa's study of Zen would have made him familiar with the famous Zen masters like Dogen and Hakuin, as well as their teachings which often intersect with poetic expressions. The combination of Okawa's interests in Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy likely fostered a profound appreciation for the interconnectedness of art and spirituality. Japanese poetry often reflects aspects of Zen philosophy, such as the focus on simplicity, directness, and the awareness of the impermanent nature of life. Overall, Okawa's affinity for both Japanese poetry and Zen philosophy highlights a deep respect and understanding of the Japanese culture. This unique perspective would have shaped the way Okawa engaged with the world around them and provided them with a wealth of inspiration, wisdom, and insight."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: who was the first one to invent medicine I found the following answer on Google: Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy.

This is not some crazy future concept -- this is a real vehicle, fully electric, and on sale now. Prices for the Twizy start at PS6,690, with battery hire from PS45 a month. But is it a car? Technically no, it' s classified under UK law as something closer to a moped . A two-seater (the passenger sits behind the driver), the Twizy runs on electric power only, and is designed to cover all those little trips we do. And as 87 percent of Europe's drivers do less than 37 miles a day -- 50 per cent less than 12--there's really no need to be burning gas for that sort of journey. The Twizy is arguably the most unusual vehicle in this country. Other cars have been beautifully designed, others have been small, but no car has turned motoring on its head in quite the same way. The Twizy's batteries have a range of 62 miles, and it plugs into a standard socket like any other electrical equipment, going from flat to full power in three and a half hours. There are no full doors on the vehicle, so think of it like a covered moped with four wheels, but no noise and no need for a helmet. There's also a lower-powered type being designed, the Twizy 45, for which you don' t need a license. Seeing the Twizy in the flesh, you' re surprised by how striking it looks. Sit in it and everything feels right --just car enough to be easy, but different enough to be exciting. With the battery underneath you, the vehicle is suckered to the road, and the electric power means it accelerates with real energy up to about 50 mph. You don't feel you need any more. In the UK, the weather alone may make it a good buy, but the lack of easy access to outdoor sockets is the biggest challenge.

If Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi are hurt by my statements, I regret what I said,\\" the DNA website quotes him as saying. Reports say Mr Singh's comments were targeted at Mrs Gandhi's \\"Italian roots\\". Born Sonia Maino on 9 December 1946 in the town of Orbassano, near Turin, to a building contractor and his wife, Mrs Gandhi was raised in a traditional Roman Catholic household. In 1964, she went to Cambridge to study English at a language school. Her life changed forever when she met her future husband, Rajiv Gandhi, who was studying engineering at the university. She is now an Indian citizen and heads the main opposition Congress party. Her party has demanded an apology from Mr Singh and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. \\"The Congress strongly deprecates and condemns the intemperate and distasteful remarks of Giriraj Singh bordering on insanity,\\" the NDTV website quotes Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala as saying.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid? Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Ken learned more about corrosive sulfuric acid, as he studied the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus which include large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid in its clouds.

Review: I did not have too much interest in watching The Flock.Andrew Lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs but he had been fired from The Flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called Niels Mueller.I had the feeling that Lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study,so they fired him and hired another director.This usually does not work well (let's remember The Invasion).But The Flock resulted to be better than what I expected.It's not a great film but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller.The character development is very well done and I could know the characters very well.Also,the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.Richard Gere and Claire Danes bring competent performances.Now,let's go to the negative points.One element which really bothered me (there was a moment in which it irritated me) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more \\"attitude\\" and style.That tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.Plus,I think the film should have been more ambitious.In spite of that,I recommend The Flock as a good thriller.It's not memorable at all,but it's entertaining.

It is the only nation with both a Red Sea coast and a Persian Gulf coast, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert or barren landforms. - Isis (original Egyptian pronunciation more likely \\"Aset\\" or \\"Iset\\") is a goddess from the polytheistic pantheon of Egypt. She was first worshiped in ancient Egyptian religion, and later her worship spread throughout the Roman Empire and the greater Greco-Roman world.

Write highlights for this article: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 22:21 EST, 5 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 04:42 EST, 6 August 2012. Half a million Sikhs in the U.S. have worried about their safety ever since the September 11 attacks, when some began targeting adherents of a peaceful religion that stresses the equality of people. Those fears came true on Sunday, when six worshippers were gunned down at a temple in suburban Milwaukee in a massacre which police believe was an act of 'domestic terrorism'. While police have not identified the gunman, who was killed by police, or described a possible motive for the Wisconsin shootings, several leaders of Sikh organizations nationwide say the killings have brought to the surface fears that have lingered since 9/11, when some ignorant about their beliefs began mistaking them for potential terrorists. Nightmare: Armed police outside the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in response to a massacre which left six worshippers dead on Sunday morning. Grief: A Sikh man wipes away a tear in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Wisconsin. 'This is something we have been fearing since 9/11, that this kind of incident will take place,' said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Washington-based Sikh Council on Religion and Education. 'It was a matter of time because there's so much ignorance and people confuse us [as] being members of Taliban or belonging to Bin Laden.' Valarie Kaur, 31, a filmmaker from New Haven, Connecticutt who has chronicled Sikh attacks for 11 years, said the shooting 'is reverberating through every Sikh American home,' where the worst is feared. 'We are experiencing it as a hate crime,' she said. 'Every Sikh American today is hurting, grieving and afraid.' The cloth turbans worn for centuries by members of the Sikh faith so they could better serve their communities through a commitment to the oneness of God in all faiths and equality for all people has ironically made them targets of those ignorant of their history, she argued. 'That turban has tragically marked us as automatically suspect, perpetually foreign and potentially terrorists,' Ms Kaur said. Horror: Sikhs have long feared a backlash from people who confuse them with jihadi terrorists. Confusion: Many members of Sikh communities in the U.S. have felt victimised since September 11. Amarjit Singh, vice president of the Illinois Sikh Community Center, which serves 5,000 Sikhs, agreed about the September 11 fears and said the congregation prayed for the slain victims as word of the shooting spread. 'We have a lot of families who have family members that attend that temple,' Mr Singh said. 'It seemed so random.' Two elderly men wearing turbans were shot to death in March while taking a walk in Elk Grove, California, and police are investigating it as a hate crime. Days after the 2001 terror attacks, a Sikh man was killed in suburban Phoenix. The man who was later convicted of his death had told his wife that 'all Arabs should be shot'. And at airports, controversy has erupted when airport workers try to search or remove Sikh turbans, considered sacred in the Sikh faith. Comfort: A father holds his daughter near the scene in Oak Creek where six Sikhs were shot dead. Tragedy: On Sunday, Sikhs were faced with a disaster many had feared would eventually come to pass. Though there were no known threats, the New York Police Department announced it was increasing coverage in an abundance of caution in and around Sikh temples. Harkirat Sandhu, 45, of Hanover Park, Illinois, a member of the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago for more than 10 years, said he worried more Sikhs could be targeted. 'The Sikh community is a peaceful community,' he said. 'We don't believe in this type of hate and crime. We condemn this situation.' 'Americans of all faiths should stand in unified support with their Sikh brothers and sisters,' said Sapreet Kaur, executive director of the New York-based Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization in the U.S. Barack Obama and his presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, expressed their sorrow in statements.South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, whose parents are Sikh, posted a statement with condolences to 'the innocent victims and the family of the heroic officer' on her Facebook page. Ms Kaur, the filmmaker, said she was encouraged by the outpouring from others, unimaginable a decade ago. 'My phone has been ringing off the hook,' she said. 'That gives me hope. Any expressions of solidarity, messages, prayers, will be felt not only by Sikhs in Milwaukee but all over the country.'","completion":"In August 2012, a tragic incident occurred at a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where six worshippers were killed in a shooting, believed by the police to be an act of 'domestic terrorism.'

Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Washington-based Sikh Council on Religion and Education, stated that the incident was something the community had been fearing since 9/11.

Amarjit Singh, vice president of the Illinois Sikh Community Center, shared the community's fears after 9/11. He mentioned that many families had connections to the Sikh temple in Milwaukee and that the shooting seemed random. The incident was not an isolated one - Sikhs have been targeted in other hate crimes and faced issues with airport workers trying to search or remove their turbans, which are considered sacred. In response to the tragedy, organizations such as the New York-based Sikh Coalition, the largest Sikh American civil rights organization, called for unity and support for the Sikh community.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that \\"it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers\\". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang \\"Tears in Heaven\\" by Eric Clapton; judge Holden told him he had \\"a gift from God in [his] voice\\". At the final on 30 May, he again sang \\"Pie Jesu\\". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he \\"was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final\\". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.During his initial audition, Johnston claimed that he was bullied and victimised from the age of six because of his singing. When asked how he dealt with the issue, he stated \\"I carry on singing.\\" There were claims in the Daily Mail, a UK-based tabloid newspaper, that the programme's producers had deliberately overstated the extent of Johnston's bullying as a \\"sob story\\", suggesting that sympathy rather than his singing got him many of the votes. However, in The Times, Johnston's success story was described as \\"the stuff of fairytales\\", as he was successful despite having been raised in \\"poverty\\".

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national visiting family in Dallas, Texas, succumbed to the deadly virus on October 8, 2014. Meanwhile, President Obama maintains his opposition to the much-discussed travel ban amid growing concerns about the potential threat the virus poses to the United States. Thomas Eric Duncan's story captured the hearts and minds of the nation as he became the first person to be diagnosed with and die from the Ebola virus in the United States. He arrived in the country from Liberia on September 20, 2014, and he began showing symptoms of the disease a few days later. On September 28, he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he would fight for his life until his tragic passing on October 8. In an emotional public statement, Duncan's fiancée, Louise Troh, described him as a \\"kind and compassionate man,\\" while expressing her deep grief over his loss. She has faced isolation and public scrutiny as a close contact of an Ebola patient, but through it all, she clung to hope for Duncan's survival, steadfastly maintaining her love and support for him throughout his battle with the deadly disease. Troh, along with her son, Duncan's extended family, friends, and members of their tight-knit Liberian community in Dallas, now come together to grieve his death and celebrate his life. Duncan's demise has sparked a vigorous discussion about the possibility of banning travel from countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak, such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. Those in favor of the ban argue that it would protect the United States from further cases of the virus, while opponents contend that it would only exacerbate the outbreak and hinder aid and relief efforts in West Africa. In a White House news conference on October 15, 2014, President Obama reiterated his opposition to a travel ban, stating that it would \\"restrict the ability of the United States to respond to the crisis.\\" Obama emphasized that the best way to contain the Ebola outbreak is by addressing the problem at its source in West Africa and noted that the administration would continue to take appropriate precautions to protect the health and security of the American people. Obama's stance on the issue is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international leaders in the fight against Ebola, who also express concern that a travel ban would hinder the efforts of healthcare workers and aid agencies in the affected regions. Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General, asserts that \\"closing borders and imposing travel bans would not stop Ebola,\\" and that \\"the only way to defeat the virus is to work together.\\" Despite the administration's objections, several members of Congress and the general public continue to call for a travel ban. The question of how best to protect the United States from the threat of the Ebola virus, while simultaneously addressing the crisis in West Africa, remains a contentious issue, with valid arguments on both sides. As family and friends mourn the loss of Thomas Eric Duncan, they also grapple with the broader implications of his tragic story. The heartbreaking case of Duncan brings to light the ongoing global health menace posed by the Ebola virus and ignites debates over the proper steps to ensure public safety in the face of this unprecedented outbreak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. I am facing a new situation today: A doctor tested two people for HIV. Tom had the virus in his blood, while Nick didn't have HIV, he was healthy. Tom has apparently had the virus for 20 years. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person didn't have the ability of the immune system to defend the body decreasing? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the new situation, the person whose ability of the immune system to defend the body is not decreasing is Nick. The article states that as time passes, the number of HIV copies in a person's body keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells, which plays a crucial role in the immune system, keeps decreasing. When the number of T cells decreases, the ability of the immune system to defend the body also decreases. Consequently, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections, and their immune system becomes more susceptible to various diseases. In the new situation, Tom has been living with HIV for 20 years, which means that over this period, his helper T cells declined, impairing his immune system’s ability to defend his body. On the other hand, Nick is healthy and does not have HIV. This implies that his helper T cells have not been affected by the virus, and his immune system is functioning normally. Therefore, it is Nick who does not have a decreasing ability of the immune system to defend his body. It is essential to note that although medicines can slow down the virus and its damage to the immune system, there is currently no cure for HIV infections or AIDS. Scientists are also working on developing a vaccine that could immunize people against HIV infection in the future. In the meantime, it is crucial for individuals to practice safe behaviors, engage in regular testing, and, if diagnosed with HIV, adhere to recommended treatment regimens to minimize the impact of the virus on their immune system and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the striker remains on Merseyside while serving his four-month ban, he will cast a heavy cloud. Brendan Rodgers needs reliability and stability as well as talent to create title-winning team.","completion":"Title: The Impact of Luis Suarez's Ban on Liverpool's Title Hopes Introduction Luis Suarez is undoubtedly a world-class footballer, capable of performing at the highest level and putting in match-winning performances for his club. However, the Uruguayan international's prowess on the field has often been overshadowed by his disciplinary problems, leading to adverse consequences for his team. In light of Suarez's latest ban, this article examines the impact of his lengthy suspension on Liverpool's title aspirations and explores Brendan Rodgers' options in terms of squad development and stability. The Significance of Suarez's Absence in the First Nine Premier League Matches Luis Suarez's prolonged suspension will see him miss the first nine Premier League matches of the upcoming season, a series of fixtures that could prove pivotal in determining Liverpool's title credentials. This ban not only entails a loss of crucial attacking talent for the Reds but also poses a significant disruption to the team's overall rhythm, as Rodgers will need to reshape his attacking lineup during this period. Among the matches that Suarez will miss are encounters against top teams, such as Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as matches that tend to be potential banana skins, such as the Merseyside Derby against Everton. In these high-pressure games, Suarez's absence may be felt even more acutely, as the Uruguayan's penchant for scoring crucial goals has been well-documented. Suarez's Presence on Merseyside: A Heavy Cloud over the Club During the four-month ban, Luis Suarez will be unable to partake in any football-related activities whatsoever, which raises questions about his role at the club. If the suspension is not reduced or overturned, Suarez is likely to be present at the club's Melwood training ground during this period. This scenario has the potential to cast a heavy cloud over the club, as rumors surrounding his future and the possible negative influence on the team's morale will remain a significant concern for the Liverpool hierarchy. The Need for Reliability, Stability, and Talent The key to any title-winning team is a combination of reliability, stability, and talent within the squad, a balance that Brendan Rodgers will struggle to strike in the initial stages of the upcoming Premier League season. In the past, the Northern Irish tactician has praised Suarez's professionalism and attitude on the training ground, but the striker's current ban negates these qualities, further disrupting the harmony in the dressing room. Rodgers will urgently need to find a solution that maintains the stability of the team while simultaneously compensating for the loss of Suarez's goals and creativity. Additionally, the manager will have to manage the expectations of the fans and the media through this period, as every Liverpool performance is likely to be scrutinized more closely due to Suarez's absence. Conclusion The considerable impact of Luis Suarez's lengthy ban poses a genuine threat to Liverpool's title aspirations for the upcoming season. The Merseyside club will need to quickly find a way to adapt to life without their talisman and ensure that they maintain a sense of stability and togetherness in the face of adversity. Brendan Rodgers has already shown his ability to handle difficult situations through his tenure at Liverpool, but the challenge of navigating the Suarez-sized void could prove to be his sternest test yet. Only time will tell whether Rodgers can minimize the effects of Suarez's absence, prevent it from derailing the team's title charge, and ultimately transform Liverpool into a force to be reckoned with in the Premier League once again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 2*t - 8 = 6*t for t.","completion":"To solve the given equation 2*t - 8 = 6*t for t, we need to isolate t on one side of the equation. Here's a step-by-step walkthrough: 1. Write down the equation: 2*t - 8 = 6*t 2. Start by moving the term containing t on the right-hand side to the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, subtract 6*t from both sides of the equation: 2*t - 8 - 6*t = 6*t - 6*t 3. Simplify the terms: -4*t - 8 = 0 4. Now, we have to isolate t by moving the constant term on the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the equation. To do this, add 8 to both sides of the equation: -4*t - 8 + 8 = 0 + 8 5. Simplify the terms: -4*t = 8 6. Finally, to isolate t, divide both sides by -4: -4*t / -4 = 8 / -4 7.

Another student told me about great websites about learning History and English. The Buddy Club is also a good place to just forget about school altogether! One of the older students taught us origami . We made paper planes, birds and hats together. The table tennis tournament was a great idea. I didn't do very well, but I learnt a lot from watching the doubles tournament won by a fourteen-year-old girl and a seventeen-year-old boy. Last year, we had the annual Buddy Club Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the games we played. After I learnt how to fish, I caught two fish in the lake. I think it might be a good idea to change the Buddy Club Picnic to a weekend camping trip. We could learn how to put up tents and how to find our way through a forest. Many of the older students know how to do this already, and I think they would like to teach the younger students.

What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases.

Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing?

Options: (a) be told Addison can't stay (b) be punished (c) be praised for their friend Step 1: Analyze the options Option (a) implies that Sydney's parents may be upset about Addison being there, possibly due to the sneaking of snacks or simply being unaware of their presence. Option (b) suggests that Sydney may get punished for sneaking snacks, which may be against the house rules or being done at an inappropriate time. Option (c) involves Sydney being praised for having a friend like Addison, which may indicate that Sydney's parents approve of their friendship or appreciate Addison's honesty. Step 2: Evaluate the options Option (a) seems less likely, as there is no direct connection between Addison hearing Sydney's parents and them being asked to leave.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.

Article: U.S. authorities have charged the alleged owner of today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website with criminal copyright infringement and have seized domain names associated with the website. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zachary T. Fardon of the Northern District of Illinois, Executive Associate Director Peter T. Edge of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement. Artem Vaulin, 30, of Kharkiv, Ukraine, was arrested today in Poland and is charged by criminal complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, with one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of criminal copyright infringement. The United States will seek to extradite Vaulin to the United States. “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.” “Copyright infringement exacts a large toll, a very human one, on the artists and businesses whose livelihood hinges on their creative inventions,” said U.S. Attorney Fardon. “Vaulin allegedly used the Internet to cause enormous harm to those artists. Our Cybercrimes Unit at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago will continue to work with our law enforcement partners around the globe to identify, investigate and prosecute those who attempt to illegally profit from the innovation of others.” “Artem Vaulin was allegedly running a worldwide digital piracy website that stole more than 1 billion in profits from the U.S. entertainment industry,” said Executive Associate Director Edge. “Protecting legitimate commerce is one of HSI’s highest priorities. With the cooperation of our law enforcement partners, we will continue to aggressively bring to justice those who enrich themselves by stealing the creative work of U.S. artists.” “Investigating cyber-enabled schemes is a top priority for CI,” said Chief Weber. “Websites such as the one seized today brazenly facilitate all kinds of illegal commerce. Criminal Investigation is committed to thoroughly investigating financial crimes, regardless of the medium. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to unravel this and other complex financial transactions and money laundering schemes where individuals attempt to conceal the true source of their income and use the Internet to mask their true identity.” According to the complaint, Vaulin allegedly owns and operates Kickass Torrents or KAT, a commercial website that has enabled users to illegally reproduce and distribute hundreds of millions of copyrighted motion pictures, video games, television programs, musical recordings and other electronic media since 2008. The copyrighted material is collectively valued at well over 1 billion, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that KAT receives more than 50 million unique visitors per month and is estimated to be the 69th most frequently visited website on the internet. In addition, a federal court in Chicago ordered the seizure of one bank account and seven domain names associated with the alleged KAT conspiracy. According to the complaint, KAT has consistently made available for download movies that were still in theaters and displayed advertising throughout its site. KAT’s net worth has been estimated at more than 54 million, with estimated annual advertising revenue in the range of 12.5 million to 22.3 million, according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that the site operates in approximately 28 languages. KAT has moved its domains several times due to numerous seizures and copyright lawsuits, and it has been ordered blocked by courts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Denmark, Belgium and Malaysia, according to the complaint. KAT has allegedly operated at various times under the domains kickasstorrents.com, kat.ph, kickass.to, kickass.so and kat.cr, and relied on a network of computer servers located around the world, including in Chicago. Several motion pictures currently available for download and sharing on KAT are still showing in theatres, including “Captain America: Civil War,” “Now You See Me 2,” “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Finding Dory,” according to the complaint. The complaint alleges that Vaulin, who used the screen name “tirm,” was involved in designing KAT’s original website, oversaw KAT’s operations and, during the latter part of the conspiracy, Vaulin allegedly operated KAT under the auspices of a Ukrainian-based front company called Cryptoneat. The charges and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. HSI and IRS-CI investigated the case with substantial assistance from the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center, the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center, the Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and the Polish Border Guard and National Prosecutor’s Office. Senior Counsel Ryan K. Dickey of the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys William E. Ridgway and Devlin N. Su of the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance in this case. ||||| Further Reading Who knew? MPAA concerned online pirates are exposed to malware Federal authorities announced on Wednesday the arrest of the alleged mastermind of KickassTorrents (KAT), the world’s largest BitTorrent distribution site. As of this writing, the site is still up. Prosecutors have formally charged Artem Vaulin, 30, of Ukraine, with one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of criminal copyright infringement. Like The Pirate Bay, KAT does not host individual infringing files but rather provides .torrent and .magnet links so that users can download unauthorized copies of TV shows, movies, and more from various BitTorrent users. According to a Department of Justice press release sent to Ars, Vaulin was arrested on Wednesday in Poland. The DOJ will shortly seek his extradition to the United States. “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials,” Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said in the statement. “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.” DMCA ignored all day long According to the 50-page affidavit authored by Jared Der-Yeghiayan, Vaulin and KAT claimed that they respected the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but they did not. Der-Yeghiayan is a special agent with Homeland Securities Investigations and also was a key witness in the trial of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. When Hollywood and other film studios filed a notice-and-takedown for a potential DMCA violation, KAT would respond this way: Greetings, Your request has been reviewed, but cannot be processed due to one (or more) of the following reasons: 1) The Claim wasn't written in English language; 2) You provided no evidence showing that you are the copyright holder or that you are acting on behalf of the copyright holder; 3) You provided no evidence showing that the content is legally copyrighted; 4) There were more then [sic] 30 torrents mentioned in the Claim email; 5) Your content is hosted on a different website. Please, make sure to fulfill all the conditions mentioned above before sending a claim. You can find more detailed information regarding the DMCA email layout via the following article - https://kat.cr/dmca/ Respectfully, KAT team Keeping mum Der-Yeghiayan also estimated KAT's annual advertising revenue as being more than 16 million per year as of 2016. In the complaint, the HSI agent also describes how an undercover IRS agent purchased an ad on KAT in March 2016 at the rate of 300 per day. The KAT representative, \\"Mr. White,\\" provided details for a Latvian bank but warned the American buyer to \\"make sure that you don’t mention KAT anywhere.\\" After a successful five-day ad buy, the undercover IRS agent again tried to buy another ad. Mr. White told him that the existing \\"faster download\\" ads were all sold out but that he could buy a pricier banner ad at 1,000 to 3,200 per day. By May, Mr. White informed the undercover agent of new banking details, this time in Estonia. Through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process, US investigators were able to easily obtain those bank records. HSI and the IRS looked into the historical hosting records of KAT and found that for about 3.5 years, ending in January 2016, the operation was hosted out of Chicago, Illinois, which explains why the case is now being prosecuted out of the Northern District of Illinois. The site also used a Canadian hosting service—the two American agencies also used MLAT to get an image of the Canadian server. Finally, Der-Yeghiayan also described how Apple provided a copy of Vaulin's e-mail account (tirm@me.com), which included other incriminating information that establishes probable cause of a criminal conspiracy. He concluded by noting that the Costa Rican and Filipino authorities have been alerted and that HSI and the IRS would be using the MLAT process to try to seize the kat.cr and kat.ph domains, among others. ||||| The U.S. Government has arrested the alleged owner of KickassTorrents, the world's largest torrent site. The 30-year-old Ukrainian was arrested in Poland today and is charged with criminal copyright infringement and money laundering. In addition, a federal court in Chicago has ordered the seizure of several KAT domain names. With millions of unique visitors per day KickassTorrents (KAT) has become the most-used torrent site on the Internet, beating even The Pirate Bay. Today, however, the site has run into a significant roadblock after U.S. authorities announced the arrest of the site’s alleged owner. The 30-year-old Artem Vaulin, from Ukraine, was arrested today in Poland from where the United States has requested his extradition. In a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the alleged owner is charged with conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and two counts of criminal copyright infringement. The complaint further reveals that the feds posed as an advertiser, which revealed a bank account associated with the site. It also shows that Apple handed over personal details of Vaulin after the investigator cross-referenced an IP-address used for an iTunes transaction with an IP-address that was used to login to KAT’s Facebook account. “Records provided by Apple showed that [email protected] conducted an iTunes transaction using IP Address 109.86.226.203 on or about July 31, 2015. The same IP Address was used on the same day to login into the KAT Facebook,” the complaint reads. In addition to the arrest in Poland, the court also granted the seizure of a bank account associated with KickassTorrents, as well as several of the site’s domain names. Commenting on the announcement, Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said that KickassTorrents helped to distribute over 1 billion in pirated files. “Vaulin is charged with running today’s most visited illegal file-sharing website, responsible for unlawfully distributing well over 1 billion of copyrighted materials.” “In an effort to evade law enforcement, Vaulin allegedly relied on servers located in countries around the world and moved his domains due to repeated seizures and civil lawsuits. His arrest in Poland, however, demonstrates again that cybercriminals can run, but they cannot hide from justice.” KAT’s .com and .tv domains are expected to be seized soon by Verisign. For the main Kat.cr domain and several others, seizure warrants will be sent to the respective authorities under the MLAT treaty. At the time of writing the main domain name Kat.cr has trouble loading, but various proxies still appear to work. KAT’s status page doesn’t list any issues, but we assume that this will be updated shortly. TorrentFreak has reached out to the KAT team for a comment on the news and what it means for the site’s future, but we have yet to hear back. Breaking story, in-depth updates will follow. Update: More in depth coverage of the complaint here. |||||Summary:","completion":"A man from Ukraine has been charged by US authorities for an alleged criminal copyright infringement for over 1bn, after he was arrested in Poland in connection to being the owner of Kickass Torrents (KAT), the world's most visited illegal file sharing website.

Q:I read this background article the other day: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. I am facing a new situation today: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, it can be inferred that Jeff's soil would likely have more toxic compounds than Brandon's soil. Since Jeff's soil is hypoxic, meaning it has low oxygen levels, anaerobic bacteria would become more active in his soil. These anaerobic bacteria use alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, manganese, and sulfate, which can lead to the formation of toxic compounds. In contrast, Brandon's soil is not hypoxic, suggesting that it has adequate oxygen levels, and thus, fewer toxic compounds would be formed due to lower activity of anaerobic bacteria."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:A brawl broke out injuring at least 10 people, including the Social Democrat leader Zoran Zaev, who was left with blood pouring down his face. The protesters, supporters of ex-Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO party, are demanding new elections. Politics in the former Yugoslav republic has been deadlocked since an inconclusive election in December. But the crisis goes back further, to a phone-tapping scandal two years ago. Mr Zaev has created a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties, but his attempts to form a government have been blocked by the president. Macedonian nationalists have been protesting on the streets since Mr Zaev tried to form the coalition. Ethnic Albanians make up around a quarter of the country's population. The people who stormed parliament were angered by the coalition's decision to elect Talat Xhaferi as speaker. They fear moves to improve the status of Albanians threaten Macedonian unity. Some of the 200 protesters were masked. Witnesses saw broken glass on the floor and traces of blood in hallways. Police fired stun grenades to disperse protesters and allow politicians to exit the parliament building. A statement from the US Embassy in Macedonia, published on Twitter, said: \\"We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms. \\"It is not consistent with democracy and is not an acceptable way to resolve differences.\\" The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted that he was \\"shocked\\" by the \\"attacks\\". \\"All parties should respect democratic process and engage in dialogue, not violence,\\" he wrote. \\"Violence has NO place in Parliament. Democracy must run its course,\\" tweeted European Union Commissioner Johannes Hahn. Skopje has also seen regular protests against the coalition by demonstrators who believe it will damage the country's national unity. Macedonia came close to civil war in 2001 after an Albanian uprising.

The people who started the fight were not happy that someone they didn't like was elected as speaker. The police had to use special noisy and bright grenades to make the protesters leave the building.

Given the question: Process: - The blood sugar drops in a body - Cells in the pancrease release glucagon - The liver in response turns the glucagon into glucose - And releases it into the blood - The blood sugar levels are restored. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less blood sugar happens, how will it affect less glucose in blood. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The process you have outlined describes the body's response to low blood sugar levels, also known as hypoglycemia. Under normal circumstances, the body regulates blood sugar levels through a series of feedback loops involving various organs and hormones. Perturbations, or disturbances, in this process could have consequences for an individual's health and well-being. In your proposed hypothesis, a situation arises where there is less blood sugar than normal, which leads to less glucose being present in the blood. To better understand the impact of this perturbation, let's first examine the individual steps described in the blood sugar regulation process: 1. Blood sugar levels drop in the body: This can occur for various reasons, such as fasting, increased physical activity, or due to medications for diabetes management. 2. Cells in the pancreas release glucagon: In response to the decrease in blood sugar levels, alpha cells in the pancreas are stimulated to secrete the hormone glucagon. 3. The liver turns glucagon into glucose: Glucagon's primary function is to signal the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose through a process known as glycogenolysis. 4. Liver releases glucose into the blood: The newly produced glucose is then released by the liver back into the bloodstream, aiming to increase blood sugar levels. 5. Blood sugar levels are restored: The rise in glucose levels signal the cessation of glucagon release, and this process of regulation will continue until a state of normal blood sugar concentration is reached. Now, let's consider the effects of your proposed perturbation - less blood sugar leading to less glucose in the blood: In the case of a persistent reduction in blood glucose levels, the body will respond using the process described above to adjust and maintain adequate blood sugar concentrations. However, if there is a sustained perturbation in this finely balanced process, it could lead to some potential consequences: 1. Direct impact on blood sugar regulation: If the body is unable to produce enough glucose to maintain blood sugar levels, it could result in a state of persistent hypoglycemia. This may cause symptoms such as dizziness, weakness, confusion, irritability, and in extreme cases, even unconsciousness or seizures. It is worth noting that the body has other mechanisms to produce glucose, such as gluconeogenesis, where new glucose is produced from non-carbohydrate precursors like amino acids and lactate. However, these processes may not fully compensate for substantially decreased blood sugar levels. 2. Indirect impact on other biological processes: Persistently low blood sugar levels could also have indirect effects on the body's overall functioning. For example, since glucose is a primary energy source for the brain, reduced glucose availability could impair cognitive functions, leading to difficulties with concentration and decision-making. Furthermore, chronic hypoglycemia could have negative implications for cellular metabolism, growth, and repair mechanisms, potentially affecting various organs and systems in the body. In conclusion, a sustained perturbation in blood sugar levels leading to less glucose in the blood could have both direct and indirect consequences on the blood sugar regulation process and the body's overall functioning. Proper monitoring and maintaining blood sugar levels within normal ranges are crucial for avoiding any disturbances in this delicate balance and ensuring optimum health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - Situated at 16 rue Bonaparte in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, the Académie nationale de médecine (National Academy of Medicine) was created in 1820 by king Louis XVIII at the urging of baron Antoine Portal. At its inception, the institution was known as the Académie royale de médecine (or \\"Royal Academy of Medicine\\"). This academy was endowed with the legal status of two institutions which preceded it the Académie royale de chirurgie (or \\"Royal Academy of Surgery\\"), which was created in 1731 and of the Société royale de médecine (or \\"Royal Society of Medicine\\"), which was created in 1776. - Albert Besson ( 1896 -- 1965 ) was a French hygienist , physician and member of the French Académie Nationale de Médecine . - A physician, medical practitioner, medical doctor or simply doctor is a professional who practises medicine, which is concerned with promoting, maintaining, or restoring health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, injury, and other physical and mental impairments. Physicians may focus their practice on certain disease categories, types of patients and methods of treatmentknown as specialitiesor they may assume responsibility for the provision of continuing and comprehensive medical care to individuals, families, and communitiesknown as general practice.

The guest list for the private event last summer at Old Billingsgate Market in Central London included six billionaires and 15 people with a personal wealth above £100million. Documents seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed there were 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, ten people in oil, gas and mining and 19 attendees working in public affairs and PR. One guest was Vladimir Putin’s judo partner Vasily Shestakov, who was introduced to the Prime Minister. The Russian president’s aide had the job of improving Russia’s reputation in the UK. The revelation will give further ammunition to Labour, which wants to paint the Conservatives as the party of the rich. The Tory fundraising dinner is an annual event and this year’s will be held next Wednesday at the Hurlingham private members’ club in West London. The main sponsor was Shore Capital, an investment bank led by Howard Shore, who has donated £450,000 to the Conservatives personally and through his companies. The documents revealed that almost 450 attendees at last summer's even at Old Billingsgate Fish Market had a combined wealth of more than £11billion. They sat at tables costing up to £12,000 each alongside David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and London Mayor Boris Johnson. He booked three ‘premier tables’ and on one hosted David and Samantha Cameron. The table also included investor Nicolas Berggruen, Slovenian tycoon Darko Horvat and property magnate Sir John Ritblat. Mr Shore’s company told The Guardian: ‘Shore Capital supported the event and made a financial contribution, as they believe that the Conservative Party, led by the Prime Minister, are the best party to govern the country.’ Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘These events are not transparent at all. ‘They are made to be private, cosy affairs where you pay for attention from a senior political figure and if you are seeking to influence the government you might have the opportunity to do so. ‘We are vulnerable as a country to people getting private access to ministers for not too much money.’ A Tory spokesman said: ‘All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with Electoral Commission rules.’ Mr Johnson shared a table with Andrei Borodin, an exiled Russian banker who is wanted by the Kremlin to face charges of ‘aggravated swindling’ over an alleged £220million bank fraud. Mrs May was placed with Lord De La Warr, director of Cluff Natural Resources which is exploring a process called coal gasification in Warwickshire. Mr Hammond shared a table with the Saudi Arabian head of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce, Afnan Al-Shuaiby, and the table was paid for by Lord Clanwilliam, a PR adviser who works for the government of Bahrain, which has faced criticism of its human rights record. Paul Staines, who runs the Guido Fawkes website, was sat at a table with Sir Michael Hintze, a top Tory donor and manager of hedge fund CQS. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles shared a table with nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow. Sir Michael has donated £3,181,473 to the Tories, while Mr Shore has given £499,330 and Mr Stringfellow £39,340. Jon Ashworth, Labour’s spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘These reports further lift the lid on a Party which is bankrolled by and stands up for a privileged few. ‘The Tories did all they could to keep this list secret and now we know why. It shows a party reliant on a select group of super-rich donors – the same group who’ve been given a tax cut by David Cameron’s Government while everyone else pays more.’","completion":"A report has revealed that prominent billionaires, bankers, and lobbyists were granted access to former Prime Minister David Cameron and other senior Cabinet members at a £12,000-a-table Tory fundraising dinner in the summer of 2013.

And he trusts the process,” Lane said. “If you’re in that process, and you’re exposed to those girls over a certain period of time, you’re going to fall in love 100 percent.” After narrowing down a pool of 25 ladies to the final four, it’s only a matter of time before the future Mrs. Higgins is revealed.

Available options: (a). they are born light-skinned people (b). light-skinned Europeans have mutation in the gene for melanin production (c). they have fewer activities outside (d). they pay much attention to protecting their skin Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Can people change their skin color1 without suffering like pop king Michael Jackson? Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin color1. The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 percent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 percent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of science. Scientists have changed the color1 of a dark-striped zebrafish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebrafish skin color1 is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanin . The number, size and darkness of melanin per pigment cell determine skin color1. It appears that, like the golden zebrafish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation in the gene for melanin production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebrafish genes. Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun , which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng. \\"Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin color1,\\" said Cheng. The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin color1 without damaging it like chemical treatment did on Michael Jackson. ks5u Question: The reason why Europeans are light-skinned is probably that _ Answer: A:","completion":"The reason why Europeans are light-skinned is probably that light-skinned Europeans have a mutation in the gene for melanin production (option b). This mutation results in less pigmented skin, which was advantageous for humans who migrated from Africa to northern latitudes, where more sunlight exposure was required for the production of vitamin D. This adaptation allowed for better health outcomes in regions with less intense sunlight. While the specific mutation may differ between humans and zebrafish, the researchers' findings suggest that the genetic mechanism underlying skin color variation is quite similar across species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The last quarterback of the quarterback class of 1983 to be taken in the first round, Marino held or currently holds dozens of NFL records associated with the quarterback position. Despite never being on a Super Bowl-winning team, he is recognized as one of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history. Best remembered for his quick release and powerful arm, Marino helped the Dolphins become consistent postseason contenders, leading them to the playoffs ten times and one Super Bowl appearance in XIX, although a title victory ultimately eluded him during his career. On Sunday, September 17, 2000, at halftime of the Dolphins-Baltimore Ravens game at Pro Player Stadium, Dan Marino's jersey number of 13 was retired. The only other Dolphins jersey number retired at the time was Bob Griese's #12. Since then #39, Larry Csonka, has been retired as well. Marino joined the Dolphins Honor Roll the same day. In a year of accolades from the franchise he led for many years, the Dolphins also installed a life-size bronze statue of Marino at Pro Player Stadium (now Hard Rock Stadium) and renamed Stadium Street to Dan Marino Boulevard. In 2003, Marino was honored for his outstanding NCAA career at Pitt with an induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. In early 2004, Marino briefly returned to the Miami Dolphins as Senior Vice President of Football Operations, but resigned from the newly created position only three weeks later, saying that the role was not in the best interest of either his family or the Dolphin organization. Marino was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, one of only four Dolphins to be elected in their first year of eligibility (Jim Langer, Paul Warfield, Jason Taylor). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame on August 7, 2005 and was introduced by his oldest son, Daniel. During his induction speech, Dan threw \\"one last pass\\" to former teammate Mark Clayton, who was sitting in the audience.

On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the FDA said it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) For the first time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is asking that a pharmaceutical company withdraw a currently marketed opioid pain medication because of the drug’s potential for abuse. The FDA is asking Ireland-based Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling reformulated Opana ER, or oxymorphone hydrochloride, because the risks outweigh any benefits of pain control, the FDA said in a statement Thursday. Endo has global headquarters in Dublin but a U.S. base in Malvern, Pa. The request comes as the United States finds itself in the middle of what the federal Department of Health and Human Services describes as an “unprecedented opioid epidemic.” More people died in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, from drug overdoses than any other year on record and more than 60% of those deaths involved an opioid, the federal government says. As word of the FDA request circulated, shares of Endo International dipped almost 13% to 11.99 on Thursday. The FDA said in its statement that if Endo does not meet its request, it will take steps to withdraw approval of the drug, prescribed when someone needs a long-term pain medication. Endo reformulated Opana ER in a way that the company said would curb the potential for abuse, but an FDA advisory committee voted 18-8 (with one abstention) in mid-March that the benefits of the reformulated version no longer outweigh risks of the drug. “The abuse and manipulation of reformulated Opana ER by injection has resulted in a serious disease outbreak,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “This action will protect the public from further potential for misuse and abuse of this product.” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement: “We are facing an opioid epidemic – a public health crisis – and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse.” Emily Walden of Kentucky lost her 21-year-old son to an Opana overdose in 2012 and traveled to Maryland to give an emotional testimony at the FDA hearing in March. “I had a gut feeling it was going to be a big deal,” Walden said of the meeting. At that time, her ultimate goal was for the FDA to request Opana’s removal from the market, but her expectations were low. “I really did not think that the FDA would follow through,” Walden said Thursday. Now she hopes the FDA will continue to evaluate other opioids and clinical trials. She said she had huge concerns about Gottlieb after his appointment, considering his ties to the pharmaceutical industry, but she’s taking this as a sign of good things to come. Walden said she has requested meetings with Gottlieb as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, but hasn’t had any luck yet. “I hope that the commissioner will meet with people like me — parents who have been affected — and get a full picture, not just the pharmaceutical side,” she said. Endo said in a statement released Thursday that it is evaluating the FDA request, but also pointed out that during the mid-March meeting, more than half of the advisory committee members said they preferred that Opana ER stay on the market but with added restrictions to prevent abuse. Read more: “Endo is reviewing the request and is evaluating the full range of potential options as we determine the appropriate path forward,” the company said. The company also said that when taken as prescribed, the drug “has a favorable risk-benefit profile.” The FDA first approved Opana ER in 2006. In 2012, Endo released a newly formulated version intended to make the drug resistant to abuse by snorting or injecting. The FDA, however, found that “data did not show that the reformulation could be expected to meaningfully reduce abuse.\\" Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2sZuaGn ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Maggie Fox For the first time ever, the Food and Drug Administration has told a drug company to pull a painkiller off the market because it has such a high potential for abuse. The FDA said Thursday that Opana ER, an extended release form of the opioid drug oxymorphone made by the drug company Endo, was being crushed up and injected by people seeking to abuse it. The following Schedule 2 narcotics are shown : Morphine Sulfate, OxyContin and Opana on January 18, 2013 in Carmichael, Calif. File Rich Pedroncelli / AP File “Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requested that Endo Pharmaceuticals remove its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride), from the market,” the FDA said in a statement. “After careful consideration, the agency is seeking removal based on its concern that the benefits of the drug may no longer outweigh its risks. This is the first time the agency has taken steps to remove a currently marketed opioid pain medication from sale due to the public health consequences of abuse.” The company is pushing back, saying the drug is safe and effective. It's not a gentle request. The FDA says if Endo doesn’t voluntarily pull the drug from the market, it will withdraw approval.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says opioid overdoses have hit record highs, killing more than 40,000 people in 2015 — more than the 32,000 who died in road accidents.

Endo, which sold 158 million worth of Opana ER in 2015, had reformulated the pills in 2012 and sought to get them labeled as abuse deterrent. The FDA said that reformulation made things worse. “The FDA’s decision is based on a review of all available postmarketing data, which demonstrated a significant shift in the route of abuse of Opana ER from nasal to injection following the product’s reformulation,” it said. “Injection abuse of reformulated Opana ER has been associated with a serious outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C,” it added.

On Thursday, June 8, 2017, the FDA said it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated,... (Associated Press) TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — U.S. regulators want a narcotic painkiller involved in the opioid epidemic off the market amid data showing people continue to abuse it. The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it has asked Endo Pharmaceuticals to stop selling its reformulated, extended-release painkiller, Opana ER, after concluding the drugs's risks outweigh its benefits. It's the first time the FDA has asked a drugmaker to remove an opioid painkiller from the market. The agency said it has seen a \\"significant shift\\" from people crushing and snorting Opana ER to get high to injecting it. Endo said in a statement it's \\"reviewing the request and is evaluating the full range of potential options.\\" Wall Street responded quickly with a sell-off, and Endo shares plunged 13.4 percent to 11.93 in trading after U.S. markets closed. The FDA move comes after advisers, reviewing the safety of Opana ER at a March hearing, voted 18-8 against keeping it on the market. Besides contributing to overdoses, abuse of Opana ER was blamed for a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles, according to the FDA. \\"We are facing an opioid epidemic - a public health crisis, and we must take all necessary steps to reduce the scope of opioid misuse and abuse,\\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \\"We will continue to take regulatory steps when we see situations where an opioid product's risks outweigh its benefits.\\" About 2 million Americans are addicted to prescription opioids, and 91 die every day from overdosing on a painkiller or much-cheaper heroin. Endo first got U.S. approval for its extended-release opioid, Opana ER, in 2006. It reformulated that drug in 2012 and claimed the changes made it harder to manipulate physically or chemically to abuse it. Endo tried to persuade FDA officials that the new formulation was abuse-resistant, which likely would have given the product a marketing advantage in the crowded, lucrative category of opioid painkillers. The FDA didn't agree, refusing to let Endo market the new formulation as abuse deterrent when it granted approval for sales several years ago. If Endo doesn't comply with the FDA's request to stop selling Opana ER, the agency can hold a hearing and start a formal process for rescinding its approval. According to the FDA, there are no generic versions of the reformulated Opana ER on the market. However, generic versions of both the original Opana ER and the original immediate-release version, called oxymorphone ER, are on sale. Those generic products might also face action by the FDA, which said it is \\"assessing the latest available data on abuse patterns.\\" Endo Pharmaceuticals makes generic pills and specialty drugs, which generally are expensive medicines for complex disorders. It's part of Endo International plc, which is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has U.S. headquarters in the Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. Endo had about 4 billion in revenue last year, only 159 million of that from Opana. ___ Follow Linda A.

Given the following passage \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\", answer the following question.

Sarah asked Katrina to help them learn to play the guitar because","completion":"Sarah had always admired Katrina's exceptional skill with the instrument. For years, Sarah had watched her friend effortlessly play the most complex tunes and compose her own melodies on the guitar. This deep appreciation for Katrina's talent had inspired Sarah to take up the instrument herself, and she couldn't think of anyone better to help her learn than her close friend. Katrina, being a kind and supportive friend, readily agreed to assist Sarah in her musical journey. They decided to meet three times a week for instruction and practice sessions. Before commencing the lessons, they came up with a course outline that would suit Sarah's learning pace, breaking down the skills required into manageable chunks. The first few lessons were centered around understanding the basic principles of guitar playing. Initially, Sarah was taught about the various parts of the guitar, such as the strings, the frets, the fretboard, the soundhole, and the bridge. Developing a thorough understanding of these elements in the beginning would provide a foundation for Sarah's future growth as a guitar player. Katrina also emphasized the importance of proper posture and holding the guitar correctly while playing. This was an essential aspect that many beginners overlooked, leading to bad habits and difficulty in making progress down the line. Sarah learned and practiced the correct way of sitting with the guitar and positioning her hands for both strumming and picking. Next, they focused on learning and practicing various chords, starting with the open chords like A, Am, E, Em, D, Dm, G, C, and F. Katrina explained the musical theory behind the chords to give Sarah a comprehensive understanding. In each practice session, Sarah would strum and switch between chords, gradually building up muscle memory and finger strength. To make the practice sessions more enjoyable, Katrina introduced Sarah to popular songs with simple chord progressions that they could play together. Another important aspect of guitar playing Katrina emphasized was rhythm and timing. Sarah was taught to use a metronome to ensure that her strumming patterns and tempo were accurate. They experimented with different time signatures, rhythms, and strumming techniques to sharpen Sarah's tempo awareness and versatility in playing various styles. As weeks turned into months, Katrina gradually introduced more advanced concepts, such as fingerstyle guitar, scales, barre chords, and improvisation. Sarah was also taught various techniques like hammer-ons, pull-offs, and slides, which are essential for playing lead guitar. To expand her musical knowledge, Sarah started learning music theory, focusing on the circle of fifths and chord progressions, which allowed her to comprehend the structure of more complicated songs. Throughout the whole process, Katrina consistently provided Sarah with constructive feedback, encouragement, and the support needed to overcome challenges and setbacks. Learning to play the guitar can be a frustrating and slow process, but due to Katrina's empathetic and patient guidance, Sarah felt motivated to continue striving toward her musical goals. Over time, Sarah's hard work and dedication, combined with Katrina's expertise and mentorship, led to significant improvements in her guitar skills. From a beginner who knew nothing about guitar playing, Sarah blossomed into an intermediate guitarist capable of playing songs she once thought were impossible. The bond between the two friends grew even stronger as a result of this shared passion. With a newfound love for her instrument and growing confidence in her skills, Sarah began to envision herself not just as someone who could play other people's songs but as a musician who could create her own melodies and compositions. Under Katrina's guidance, she started exploring songwriting and music production. As Sarah's musical journey continued, their friendship thrived, and both women found joy in learning and growing together, creating a bond that transcended music itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the two facts above, what is an example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs.? Answer:","completion":"An example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs, given the facts provided, is the Green Iguana (Iguana iguana). This species belongs to the reptile class, which comprises tetrapod vertebrates that lay amniotic eggs. As a lizard, the Green Iguana exemplifies how these characteristics apply to this specific group of reptiles. The Green Iguana is a large, arboreal lizard native to Central and South America. It can grow up to 2 meters (6.5 feet) in length, including its tail, and has a distinctively vibrant green coloration. Adapted to life in the rainforest, Green Iguanas have strong limbs for climbing trees and a prehensile tail to help with balance and navigation. Green Iguanas reproduce via oviparity, which means they lay eggs rather than give birth to live young. The eggs that they lay are amniotic in nature, providing a protective and nurturing environment for the developing embryo. The amniotic membrane not only retains vital fluids, but also facilitates gas exchange, allowing the embryo to receive oxygen and expel waste products, like carbon dioxide. In general, amniotic eggs provide a vital advantage to terrestrial animals, as they reduce dependency on water bodies for reproductive purposes. Additionally, as a prerequisite to being classified as a tetrapod vertebrate, the Green Iguana has a backbone and four limbs. This structural feature allows the animal to bear its weight and move in different environments, like trees and rocks, increasing its ability to find suitable habitats, forage for food, and escape predators. In conclusion, the Green Iguana is an excellent example of a tetrapod vertebrate that produces amniotic eggs, showcasing the defining characteristics of reptiles in general and lizards in particular. Its unique adaptations for arboreal life, coupled with its reproductive strategies, reflect how these traits have played a crucial role in the successful evolution and diversification of reptiles as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) Japan's helicopter carrier Izumo sails in the waters off the Boso Peninsula, east of Tokyo, as it starts to escort a U.S. supply ship after departing Yokosuka port, south of Tokyo, Monday, May 1, 2017. Japan's navy has dispatched its largest destroyer reportedly tasked with escorting U.S. military ships... (Associated Press) SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A contentious U.S. anti-missile system in southeastern South Korea is now operating and can now defend against North Korean missiles, a South Korean official said Tuesday. The Terminal High Altitude Defense system set up at a converted golf course in Seongju has \\"early capability\\" to respond to North Korea's nuclear and missile threat, Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said. He didn't say when Washington and Seoul expected THAAD to be operating fully. The deployment has triggered anger from Seongju residents who fear North Korea may target their town and who worry about rumored health hazards linked to THAAD's powerful radar. People also debate whether the security benefits of THAAD would outweigh drawbacks if relations worsen with China, which sees the system as a threat, and they have been angered by President Donald Trump's statement that he would make South Korea pay 1 billion for the system. The United States and South Korea say THAAD is crucial to counter North Korea's weapons advances. The North conducted two nuclear tests last year alone, which experts say would have improved its knowledge for making nuclear warheads small enough to fit on missiles, and has been speeding up its development of new missiles, including solid-fuel rockets that can be fired from mobile launchers on land and from submarines. President Donald Trump says he isn't ruling out military action against North Korea but has also expressed openness to a future meeting with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, offering unusual praise for the third-generation dictator amid the nuclear tensions. \\"If it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,\\" Trump told Bloomberg News. In an interview with CBS' \\"Face the Nation\\" that aired Sunday, Trump said Kim was obviously a \\"pretty smart cookie\\" as he took power in his 20s and held it despite \\"a lot of people\\" trying to take it away. The THAAD battery had originally been scheduled to enter operation by the end of the year. When completed, it will consist of six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptors toward incoming missiles detected by the system's x-band radar. Critics question whether the United States and Seoul's caretaker government are rushing to set up THAAD before an election May 9 that will bring a change in the government in Seoul, which became necessary after Park Geun-hye was impeached and ousted from the presidency in a corruption scandal. Front-runner Moon Jae-in, a liberal who calls for engagement with North Korea, has said he would reconsider THAAD if he becomes president. North Korea conducted another missile test on Saturday, its third launch in April alone, which reportedly failed soon after launch, and its Foreign Ministry said Monday the country will speed up measures to bolster its nuclear program \\"at the maximum pace.\\" A statement circulated by North Korea's U.N. Mission says the government is ready to respond to any option taken by the United States. ||||| THAAD missile defense system now operational in S.Korea Washington (AFP) - A controversial missile defense system whose deployment has angered China is now operational in South Korea, a US defense official said Monday. Washington and Seoul agreed to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery deployment in July in the wake of a string of North Korean missile tests. \\"It has reached initial intercept capability,\\" the official told AFP on condition of anonymity. This initial capability will be augmented later this year as additional hardware and components arrive to complete the system, officials said. THAAD's deployment in South Korea has infuriated China, which fears it will weaken its own ballistic missile capabilities and says it upsets the regional security balance. The THAAD system, which is being installed on a former golf course in the southern county of Seongju, is designed to intercept and destroy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles during their final phase of flight. Beijing has imposed a host of measures seen as economic retaliation against the South for the THAAD deployment, including a ban on tour groups. Retail conglomerate Lotte, which previously owned the golf course, has also been targeted, with 85 of its 99 stores in China shut down, while South Korea's biggest automaker Hyundai Motor has said its Chinese sales have fallen sharply. The THAAD deployment comes as tension soars on the Korean peninsula following a series of missile launches by the North and warnings from the administration of US President Donald Trump that military action is an \\"option on the table.\\" - Who should pay - Further complicating matters, Trump stunned Seoul last week when he suggested South Korea should pay for the 1 billion THAAD system. \\"I informed South Korea it would be appropriate if they paid. It's a billion-dollar system,\\" Trump was quoted as saying in a published report. \\"It's phenomenal, shoots missiles right out of the sky.\\" Seoul retorted that under the Status of Forces Agreement that governs the US military presence in the country, the South would provide the THAAD site and infrastructure while the US would pay to deploy and operate it. Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that South Korea's sole THAAD battery does not quite have the range to cover the entire country.

Let's solve this step by step together. We have the math problem: 1685 * m + 8700 = -2661 - 2119 First, let's solve the right side of the equation by subtracting -2661 and -2119: -2661 - 2119 = -4780 Now our equation looks like this: 1685 * m + 8700 = -4780 Next, let's move the 8700 to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 1685 * m = -4780 - 8700 Now, subtract -4780 and -8700 together: -4780 - 8700 = -13480 Our equation is now: 1685 * m = -13480 The last step is to solve for m! We'll do that by dividing both sides by 1685: m = -13480 / 1685 Now, let's do the division: -13480 ÷ 1685 ≈ -8 So, m is approximately equal to -8.

LABOR HISTORY SLIGHTED, EXPERTS SAY As the nation marked Labor Day and the labor movement observed what it calls the centennial of American labor, experts were saying that American labor history has been highly neglected in schools, that labor's historic sites are often not marked or maintained and that labor history has often been accorded second-class status. Labor history has, for the most part, not been taught as a part of American history, said Herbert G. Gutman, professor of American history at City University of New York. Rather, he said, the focus has been on the nation's founding fathers, presidents, diplomats, politics and wars. Philip S. Foner, another labor historian, said labor history, when it did receive attention, was generally placed ''in terms of strikes and violence.'' American educators have essentially attempted to see working-class people ''as organizing to protect themselves and then entering the mainstream of civilization and that is the end of it,'' Mr. Gutman explained. 'No Sense of Labor History' ''There is no sense of labor history,'' said Studs Terkel, for many years an observer of the labor movement and working-class people. And this partly explains, he suggested, why the labor movement is in such trouble today. ''Working people themselves have no understanding of their past,'' he said, ''no idea where the minimum wage or the eight-hour day came from. There is no past.'' Some developments in recent years are praised by labor experts, however. A series of highly praised movies have explored essentially unknown or long forgotten events or movements. ''Northern Lights'' was a portrayal of the agrarian protest movement of the upper Middle West in the 1920's. ''With Babies and Banners'' was a study of wives and children of autoworkers who conducted the Flint, Mich., sit-down strike of 1936-37. ''The Wobblies'' was a remembrance of the Industrial Workers of the World. ''Harlan County, U.S.A.'' was a study of striking coal miners in Kentucky. State Organizations Emerging In addition, several state organizations have sprung up that are patterned after the Illinois Labor History Society. That group has published histories of such events as the Haymarket incident in 1896 in Chicago, in which a bomb killed seven police officers and four workers. The group also has published information on key sites of the 1894 Pullman strike, when the American Railway Union struck, unsuccessfully, after the company cut wages. A group active in a similar vein is District 1199 of the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees in New York. Under its ''Bread and Roses'' project, the group has produced plays and musicals for hospital workers and a study of the 1912 textile workers' strike in Lawrence, Mass. Finally, the history of the labor movement seems, in the last 10 years or so, to have gained more acceptance from universities, the labor movement and historians themselves, according to David Brody, professor of American history at the University of California at Davis. Second-Class Area of Stu dy Yet, even with these trends, the study of labor history often remains a second-class area of scholarship and understanding, the experts said. In the late 19th century, when history emerged as a profession, historians often constituted a ''gentleman's club,'' and there was little, if any, interest in working-class movements, Mr. Gutman said. ''We study the history of successful things,'' he said, adding that workers and their movements often were treated with a ''condescension of silence.'' Mr. Foner argued that the Haymarket incident and similar events ''were portrayed as sheer disasters for working people and America.'' Instead, he suggested, such events, while unsuccessful at the time, were the base on which the American union movement was built. No Monuments for Victims Mr. Foner said historic sites were neglected because the battles were often perceived as losses by labor, and ''monuments are not erected to victims.'' The A.F.L.-C.I.0 also believes that labor history is often neglected by historians and educators. A 1966 study by the federation of textbooks in use in Los Angeles County said that not ''a single labor topic,'' except the disputes between industrial and craft unions, ''was adequately described'' in the majority of the textbooks. In 1979, in a study published in the Harvard Educational Review, Jean Anyon, professor of education at Rutgers University, said American history books suggested that all workers had achieved middle-class status and that strikes generally were fruitless. Mr. Gutman and Mr. Foner said the A.F.L-C.I.O. itself was incorrect in describing this year's celebration, marking the founding in 1881 of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions, as the centennial of not only the merged federation but of the American labor movement as well. ''The A.F.L. always took the position that there was nothing before it and that it represented the labor movement,'' Mr. Foner said. History Needed Mr. Brody suggested that a reason why labor seemed more open to study was that it was trying to provide a legitimacy for the labor movement, in the face of declining union memberships and a conservative government in Washington. ''It needs this history of itself,'' he said. Mr. Gutman said it was important for historians to present studies of workers and their movements, not merely descriptions of institutions. He said such labor figures as Samuel Gompers, Eugene V. Debs, William D. Haywood and Terence V. Powderly subscribed to the view that the conditions of the moment were not necessarily permanent. This view, he said, has largely been ''washed out'' of the labor movement, and unless it returns, labor will have trouble maintaining its role in American life.

Experts argue that events and movements from labor history should be seen as an important part of American history, rather than just focusing on successful things or violent strikes.

Worst Vegas stay!!! Where do I even begin with the crappiest hotel experience? We stayed here over Columbus Day weekend for a friend's 30th Bday celebration. We got a king suite with an adjoining two queen room in the Paradise Tower. Strike 1: They advertised a pullout couch and there was NO pullout couch. We called for a rollaway which they wanted to charge 20 a night. Excuse me? False advertising and I have to pay for it?! Called three times until finally got the rollaway in the room delivered. Strike 2: Asked for Nonsmoking room but the room reeked of smoke which did numbers on my allergies. I know I'm in Vegas, but I don't have to breath that crap while I sleep. Strike 3: the shower did not drain and water pooled up to my ankles. Called maintenance to repair and yet again they didn't show. Left for Pool/Brunch 4 hrs later returned with it still clogged. Called second time and finally they fixed it after waiting around 30 min before we could get ready for dinner. Strike 4: There is no room in the fridge for your own refreshments and a fridge is again 20 a day. Seriously for a suite what good is an in room bar without a fridge? For the price of the room it should be available. Guess they don't want you not buying THEIR drinks. Strike 5: As a hotel guest we should get free admission to the day pool parties at least on a guest list. Nope still have to pay- seriously? Marquee Day Club offers this to their hotel guests why can't Hard Rock? Strike 6: the TV cable was so horrible and kept cutting out couldn't play any music stations from that and there was no Auxillary input to plug in our own music thru the TV speakers. When we complained to the reception they only comped us one resort fee wow a whopping 22.50. I have stayed multiple times at the Hard Rock San Diego which is newer and has better rooms.

A:","completion":"To determine if Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart wrote about the same themes, I will first research and identify common themes found in their works. Step 1: Research about Stephen Spender and his work Stephen Spender was a British poet, essayist, and critic. He was born in 1909 and passed away in 1995. Some of the notable works of Stephen Spender include his poetry collections \\"Twenty Poems\\" (1930) and \\"The Orators\\" (1932). His writing mainly tackled topics such as war, social inequality, and freedom of expression. His works also expressed leftist political ideals. Step 2: Research about Mary Stewart and her work Mary Stewart was a British novelist, born in 1916 and passed away in 2014. Her works mainly belong to the genres of romantic suspense and historical fiction. Some of the notable works of Mary Stewart include \\"The Crystal Cave\\" (1970), \\"The Hollow Hills\\" (1973), and \\"The Wicked Day\\" (1983). Her writing often integrated elements of mystery, adventure, and romance. Step 3: Compare the themes in their works Comparing the themes in the works of Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart, it becomes evident that their focus was quite different. While Spender's work primarily dealt with social, political, and philosophical themes, Stewart's work was more focused on crafting suspenseful stories with romance and adventure. Conclusion: Based on the information I gathered, Stephen Spender and Mary Stewart did not write about the same themes. Spender's themes were mainly centered around war, social inequality, and freedom of expression, while Stewart's themes focused on aspects of romantic suspense and historical fiction, often weaving tales of mystery and adventure. Their works cater to different genres and literary styles, and therefore, they address different thematic concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The maid wanted to use the mop to clean the floor but the Select from the following. -- mop was too small.. -- floor was too small.. Answer:","completion":"The maid wanted to use the mop to clean the floor, but the mop was too small, which made it incredibly difficult for her to efficiently cover the expansive area in the room, requiring her to expend a large amount of time and energy in order to make the floor spotless and free from any dirt, grime, or dust that may have accumulated on the surface over time. Despite her best efforts, the maid soon realized that continuing to use this undersized mop would inadvertently slow down her progress, and potentially result in a subpar cleaning job that would not meet the high standards set by her employer. In order to rectify this unforeseen issue, the maid considered a variety of potential solutions that she could utilize to properly clean the floor in a timely manner. First, she contemplated the possibility of acquiring a larger mop that could cover a broader area of the floor with each swipe, thereby speeding up the cleaning process and allowing her to meet the expectations of her employer. Alternatively, she could assess other cleaning tools and methods at her disposal, such as a vacuum cleaner or a broom, which may prove to be more effective in addressing the unique challenges presented by the room's size. Upon weighing the pros and cons of each option, the maid came to the conclusion that she would need to acquire a larger mop in order to fulfill her duties effectively and satisfy her employer's stringent cleanliness requirements. With this decision in mind, she promptly headed to the nearest supply store, where she carefully perused the available selection of mops, searching for one that would be more appropriately suited for the task at hand. Upon finding a larger, more durable mop with a wider head and highly absorbent material, the maid purchased the item and returned to the room in need of cleaning. Armed with her new, upgraded mop, she was able to tackle the task with renewed vigor and efficiency, making quick work of the previously daunting floor space and leaving it immaculate, much to the delight and satisfaction of her employer. In the end, the maid's resourcefulness and adaptability enabled her to overcome the challenges posed by her initial cleaning tool, demonstrating her dedication to her work and her commitment to always providing the highest level of service to those who relied on her expertise and skill.

The sentence \\"Nastavte globální oprávnění uživatele\\" translates to \\"Set global user permissions\\" in English. In the context of a computer system or software, setting global user permissions refers to configuring the access rights and privileges granted to individual users across the entire system. This determines what actions users are allowed to perform, such as reading, writing, or modifying files and data. A detailed process for setting global user permissions depends on the particular operating system or software being used. Below, I will provide a general overview of the steps involved in setting global user permissions: 1. Identify user roles: Establish different roles for users, representing their responsibilities and activities within the system. Common roles may include administrators, managers, and basic users. 2. Define access levels: Set up specific access levels, such as read, write, and modify, that can be applied to different resources within the system, such as files, directories, and databases. 3. Assign access levels to user roles: Tie the access levels to the user roles, so each role will have a specific set of privileges depending on its responsibilities. 4. Create user accounts: Set up user accounts for each individual who will access the system, and assign each user a role (or roles) to define their permissions. 5. Implement access controls: Ensure that the system properly enforces access controls, protecting sensitive data and functionality from unauthorized access. This may involve configuring firewalls, access control lists, and other security measures. 6. Monitor and audit: Regularly review and update user accounts, user roles, and access levels to ensure that permissions remain appropriate and secure. Track user activities, review logs, and audit permissions to detect any security issues or violations. 7. Maintain documentation: Keep thorough and up-to-date documentation for all user accounts, user roles, access levels, and permissions assignments. This can help with troubleshooting and make it easier to make changes or updates to the system. By following these steps, you can establish a robust and secure set of global user permissions for a computer system or software application. Remember, though, that each operating system and software platform has its own methods and tools for setting permissions, so be sure to consult the appropriate documentation."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road. - Kensington Temple is a large Pentecostal church in the Notting Hill area of London , England . It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye , and is the largest church in its denomination , the Elim Pentecostal Church . - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market. - Carnival (see other spellings and names) is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent. The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent). Carnival typically involves a public celebration and/or parade combining some elements of a circus, masks, and a public street party. People wear masks and costumes during many such celebrations, allowing them to lose their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity. Excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods proscribed during Lent is extremely common. Other common features of carnival include mock battles such as food fights; social satire and mockery of authorities; the grotesque body displaying exaggerated features, especially large noses, bellies, mouths, and phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms.

Answer the following question: Information: - Wilfrid ( II ) or Wilfrith ( II ) ( died on 29 April in either 745 or 746 ) also known as Wilfrid the Younger , was the last Bishop of York , as the see was converted to an archbishopric during the time of his successor . In the 10th century , two different groups claim to have taken the relics of an earlier Wilfrid from Ripon ; most likely one party took those of Wilfrid the Younger . The younger Wilfrid 's feast is attested in the Calendar of Winchcombe and later martyrologies , though he does not seem to have had a widespread or popular veneration . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.) was a Northumbrian synod where King Oswiu of Northumbria ruled that his kingdom would calculate Easter and observe the monastic tonsure according to the customs of Rome, rather than the customs practised by Irish monks at Iona and its satellite institutions. The synod was summoned at Hilda's double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey. - Wilfrid (originally spelled Wilfrith; c. 633 c. 709) was an English bishop and saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria. - Ripon is a cathedral city in the Borough of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is located at the confluence of two tributaries of the River Ure, the Laver and Skell. The city is noted for its main feature, Ripon Cathedral which is architecturally significant, as well as the Ripon Racecourse and other features such as its market. The city itself is just over 1,300 years old. - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC. - The Holy Island of Lindisfarne is a tidal island off the northeast coast of England. It is also known just as Holy Island. It constitutes the civil parish of Holy Island in Northumberland. Holy Island has a recorded history from the 6th century AD. It was an important centre of Celtic Christianity under Saints Aidan of Lindisfarne, Cuthbert, Eadfrith of Lindisfarne and Eadberht of Lindisfarne. After the Viking invasions and the Norman conquest of England, a priory was reestablished. A small castle was built on the island in 1550. - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.

Trump is facing an early test with fellow Republicans over U.S.... (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump is facing an early test with fellow Republicans over U.S. relations with Russia, as lawmakers seek to investigate a CIA assessment that Russia interfered in the November election and issue warnings over the incoming president's potential pick for secretary of state. Trump said Sunday the recent CIA assertion that Russian hacking had sought to help his candidacy was \\"ridiculous,\\" and he praised ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who has emerged as the leading contender to lead the State Department. But two key Senate Republicans — John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a leading Trump critic — joined with two Democrats in seeking a bipartisan investigation into the Kremlin's activities during the election. And McCain, the party's 2008 presidential nominee, questioned whether Trump should nominate Tillerson, citing the executive's longstanding business ties with Moscow. \\"It's a matter of concern to me that he has such a close personal relationship with Vladimir Putin,\\" McCain said of Tillerson. \\"And obviously they've done enormous deals together.\\" In an interview with CBS' \\"Face the Nation,\\" McCain said, \\"That would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat.\\" Russia expects to figure prominently at the start of a week in which Trump is expected to name more members of his Cabinet, which also has vacancies in the departments of Energy, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs. Trump is also planning a news conference on Thursday to outline how he intends to separate himself from his sprawling business enterprise. During his campaign, Trump weathered turbulent relations with fellow Republicans but has since forged a more united front with GOP lawmakers since his November victory over Hillary Clinton. The CIA recently concluded with \\"high confidence\\" that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump, raising red flags among lawmakers concerned about the sanctity of the U.S. voting system and potentially straining relations at the start of Trump's administration. In a wide-ranging interview with \\"Fox News Sunday,\\" Trump dismissed those concerns as little more than partisan griping. \\"I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country. And frankly, I think they're putting it out. And it's ridiculous,\\" Trump said. The incoming president said he did not necessarily oppose calls from President Barack Obama for an inquiry into the 2016 campaign hacking but said it should not be solely focused on a single culprit. \\"If you're gonna to do that, I think you should not just say 'Russia.' You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals,\\" he said. The White House has said the probe would focus on any breaches by other countries along with hacking committed in previous elections. Trump's decision-making on whom to select for secretary of state has stretched out over several weeks. He has been considering former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a one-time vocal Trump critic, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who leads the Foreign Relations Committee, and Tillerson, the oil industry executive who met twice with Trump during the past week. In the television interview, Trump pointed to Tillerson's deep relations with Moscow as a selling point. As ExxonMobil's head, he maintained close ties with Russia and was awarded by Putin with the Order of Friendship in 2013, an honor for a foreign citizen. \\"A great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company,\\" Trump said, while also citing Corker and Romney. \\"These are all very different types of people,\\" he said. \\"But when you ask me about Rex, I mean, he's a world-class player. There's no question about it.\\" By Sunday afternoon, Tillerson had still not been formally offered the job, according to a person with knowledge of the process who spoke on condition of anonymity. Democrats have warned that plucking Tillerson for State would put the leader of the world's largest oil company in a pivotal role on issues like climate change and the future of the Keystone XL pipeline. They also question whether he would apply diplomatic pressure on Russia's conflict with Ukraine. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the developments \\"raise serious questions about whether the incoming administration will adequately stand up to Russia's aggression.\\" The prospect of Tillerson also received a cool reception from some Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which would consider his nomination. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the GOP nomination, wrote on Twitter, \\"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a (hashtag)SecretaryOfState.\\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he would reserve judgment. The committee also includes Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a Trump detractor during the campaign. Russia's influence has also been seized upon by a small group of Democratic electors who call themselves the \\"Hamilton Electors\\" and are trying to persuade electors to back another Republican because they contend Trump is unfit to be president. Trump won 306 electoral votes in the election, a comfortable margin to make him the next president when the electoral college meets Dec. 19. But the Hamilton Electors want the CIA and FBI to provide more details on Russia's influence before that date. \\"We believe that we should do our job faithfully as electors and not just rubber stamp the election,\\" said Michael Baca, a Democratic elector from Colorado who co-founded the group. ___ Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman in Washington and Alex Sanz in Atlanta contributed to this report. ||||| Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to ensure Trump’s victory. Donald Trump says CIA charge Russia influenced election is 'ridiculous' Read more Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus. “When the president-elect’s transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community [IC], it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts,” Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian. Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency. It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns. One noted that civil-service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people “who have attended climate change policy conferences”. Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new president’s attitudes toward the agencies. There is not just smoke here. There is a 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid Glenn Carle, former CIA officer “There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing 10-alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half-burnt and holding a match,” said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator. “The facts hurt, Trump won’t like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity.” After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committee’s digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election. In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement: “These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump “cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign” and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence. “If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard-working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths,” Schiff said. “Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions?” Trump’s clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January. Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump. Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary. Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was “no surprise”. He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of “delusions of ‘resetting’ relations with Russia” – a policy that Trump is also pursuing. On Sunday, anti-Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country. “We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society,” the senators said in a joint statement. “Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks.” Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations-heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to “join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nation’s interests over the interests of any political party”. FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump's election win, Harry Reid claims Read more Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trump’s temperament had played into Russia’s hands and put the president-elect on a collision course with the CIA. He said: “Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself. “He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence ‘target’ to manipulate.” Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, “he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States”. A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the “serious matter” of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since “it happened on our watch”. ||||| Correction: An earlier version of this column stated incorrectly that Donald Trump's electoral college victory was the seventh largest of the past 10 presidential elections. It ranked eighth of the past 10 elections. This version has been updated.

The president-elect has gone to Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio, and saluted workers at an Indiana plant where he says he saved more than 1,000 jobs. The CIA’s finding that Vladimir Putin’s Russia actively intervened in our election to help Donald Trump explains why many of us are not simply disappointed or unhappy that Trump won. We are genuinely alarmed. And Trump’s cavalier response to these fears only deepens them. When The Post revealed the CIA’s conclusions about Russia, Trump’s response was to insult the CIA, tell a lie about the size of his victory and act as if an election still very fresh in our minds were some sort of historical event dating back to the Pilgrims. The statement put out by Trump’s transition team, so obtuse and so arrogant, needs to be cited in full: “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.’” That Trump would happily trash our own CIA to get Putin off the hook is disturbing enough — and, by the way, there were dissenters in the CIA on Iraq. That he would ignore the risks our intelligence agents take on so many fronts to protect us is outrageous. CIA officials told senators it is now “quite clear” that electing Donald Trump was Russia’s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) [Let’s get the facts right on foreign involvement in our elections] Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was genuinely disturbed over how a pampered and privileged man so readily threw our intelligence officers under the bus to make a political point. “Perhaps, once he has taken office,” Schiff said, “Mr. Trump will go to CIA and look at the rows of memorial stars in the lobby — each representing a fallen officer — and reflect on his disparagement of the intelligence community’s work.” Oh, yes, and about his having won “one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history”? In the past 10 elections, Trump’s electoral college take ranks eighth. The CIA finding is all the more worrisome because of how Trump has willingly served as a Putin apologist. On NBC in September, for example, Trump sounded very impressed with Putin’s power when he declared: “The man has very strong control over a country.” Well, yes, an autocrat whose opponents often turn up dead does exercise “very strong control.” Trump went on to declare that Putin had been a leader “far more than our president has been a leader.” I don’t know about Trump, but I think most Americans would rather live under Barack Obama. A further cause for concern: Trump and his top lieutenant Stephen K. Bannon have openly allied themselves with the far-right forces in Europe that Putin has championed. In a timely article for the Atlantic, “Russia and the Threat to Liberal Democracy,” Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, speaks of a “romance between far-right, anti-immigrant European parties” and Putin. A Trump romance with Putin fits neatly into this narrative — which is precisely why Trump should want to dispel our fears rather than aggravate them. Diamond declared: “We stand now at the most dangerous moment for liberal democracy since the end of World War II.” Why are we afraid? Because Trump gives us reason to worry he will not be on the right side of this fight. [‘Lessons learned’ about Russia] Nor was it reassuring that a day after the story about the CIA’s finding broke, Trump’s inner circle leaked that his likely choice as secretary of state was Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive who had negotiated oil deals with Putin. For Tillerson’s efforts, Putin awarded him Russia’s Order of Friendship. “Friends and associates said few U.S. citizens are closer to Mr. Putin than Mr. Tillerson,” the Wall Street Journal reported. Is it paranoid to want to know whether Tillerson’s ties to Putin are why he is at the top of Trump’s list to be our top diplomat? Is it out of line to wonder, given Trump’s lack of transparency about his finances, what role Russia has played in his business empire? After all, his son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that “Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets” and added: “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.” Now more than ever, we need to know exactly what he was talking about. Trump’s circle will deride Democrats who ask such questions, but it will not be so easy for them to dismiss Republicans such as Sens. John McCain and Lindsey O. Graham. Those of us profoundly worried about a Trump presidency would be a little less anxious if more Republicans joined them in responding to this challenge not as partisans but as patriots.

In an interview with Fox News’ Eric Shawn, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations questioned why FBI Director James Comey said during the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server that there was no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but Russian cyber fingerprints were found in the alleged presidential election hacks. Story Continued Below “It is not at all clear to me, just viewing this from the outside, that this hacking into the [Democratic National Committee] and the Republican National Committee] computers was not a false flag,” Bolton said. “So the question has to be asked, why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary’s server, but their dumb intelligence service against the election?” Bolton did not mention that Comey’s statement might have meant there was no foreign intrusion into Clinton’s server. Shawn then asked Bolton — who has been mentioned as a possible appointee in Donald Trump’s State Department — whether he was accusing someone in “the administration or in the intelligence community” of the alleged false flag. “We just don’t know,” Bolton said. “But I believe that the intelligence community has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.” A “false flag” is a term for a cover-up or distraction orchestrated by the government or other powerful figures. Shawn continued to push Bolton, asking why intelligence officials would politicize the hack and would “go so far to something that could damage the very issue of our republic and what we for 200-plus years have stood for.” “The whole thing has been called into question, which is why the notion of some kind of independent investigation becomes extremely important,” Bolton said. “I do think it’s critical to answer the question that I posed: If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?” Last week, The Washington Post published a report saying the intelligence community believes that Russia was favoring Trump in the presidential race. President Barack Obama has requested a review of the situation. A bipartisan group of senators — John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed — has also called for an independent investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election. During the interview, Bolton said he had concerns about Obama trying to get the review wrapped up by Jan. 20. He said he thinks the burden of the review will fall on Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee for director of the CIA. “He doesn’t bring any baggage to this; I would look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence community,” Bolton said. Bolton said that if the claims about Russia were true, the U.S. “should retaliate.” “It is unacceptable for the American Constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don’t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are,” he said. Asked by Shawn about people who might be bothered by the false flag claim, Bolton said there needs to be more information about how the intelligence community came to its conclusion. “We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians,” Bolton said. “That’s why I say until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion, we don’t whether it’s Russian-inspired or a false flag.” ||||| WASHINGTON — American spy and law enforcement agencies were united in the belief, in the weeks before the presidential election, that the Russian government had deployed computer hackers to sow chaos during the campaign. But they had conflicting views about the specific goals of the subterfuge. Last week, Central Intelligence Agency officials presented lawmakers with a stunning new judgment that upended the debate: Russia, they said, had intervened with the primary aim of helping make Donald J. Trump president. The C.I.A.’s conclusion does not appear to be the product of specific new intelligence obtained since the election, several American officials, including some who had read the agency’s briefing, said on Sunday. Rather, it was an analysis of what many believe is overwhelming circumstantial evidence — evidence that others feel does not support firm judgments — that the Russians put a thumb on the scale for Mr. Trump, and got their desired outcome. It is unclear why the C.I.A. did not produce this formal assessment before the election, although several officials said that parts of it had been made available to President Obama in the presidential daily briefing in the weeks before the vote. But the conclusion that Moscow ran an operation to help install the next president is one of the most consequential analyses by American spy agencies in years. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The alleged interference by the Russian government in the 2016 US presidential election to ostensibly favor Donald Trump has created a furore that continues to rumble on. According to an internal CIA assessment, Russia intervened in the election in an attempt to help Trump win the presidency.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake. Question: suppose earth does not crack happens, how will it affect MORE/STRONGER earthquakes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"If the earth does not develop cracks deep beneath its surface, it would lead to fewer and potentially weaker earthquakes. To understand this, it’s important to comprehend the role that these cracks, also known as faults, play in the occurrence of earthquakes. Faults are fractures in the Earth's crust where two tectonic plates meet and may move relative to each other. The movement of these tectonic plates leads to the buildup of stress and strain in rocks surrounding the fault lines. When the stress reaches a breaking point, the stored energy is suddenly released in the form of seismic waves, which we experience as earthquakes. Now, considering the scenario where the Earth does not develop cracks or fault lines, there would be a few possible outcomes: 1. Tectonic plate movement may be severely hindered, leading to a significant reduction in stress buildup. This would mean that the number of earthquakes would decrease, and the ones that do occur may be of lower intensity (Option B: Less). 2. In the absence of faults, the stress and energy accumulated within the Earth's crust might still exist but be distributed more uniformly throughout the planet. This could potentially reduce the chances of major earthquakes from taking place while also leading to the occurrence of smaller earthquakes spread across a wider geographical area (Option B: Less). 3. However, it's also possible that without the presence of faults to relieve stress at specific locations, the energy within the Earth's crust would continue to accumulate until it reaches catastrophic levels. In this scenario, when an earthquake finally occurs, it could be a single event of considerably higher magnitude than those typically experienced around fault lines. This potential situation cannot be definitively ruled out, but it is less likely than the first two scenarios. Ultimately, without the development of cracks or fault lines, the Earth would likely experience fewer and potentially weaker earthquakes. This is supported by the understanding that faults are responsible for the displacement of tectonic plates and the release of energy in the form of seismic waves. So, the most supported answer is Option B: Less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Just shaved my beard off in order to avoid facial tan lines, although it's almost guaranteed that I'll get burnt today How would the sentiment of this tweet be described? Choices: (1). negative (2). positive","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as a mix of positive and negative, although it leans more towards the positive (2). The negative aspect of the sentiment emerges from the mention of facial tan lines and the near certainty of getting burnt today. These elements suggest that the individual is unhappy with or concerned about the appearance of tan lines on their face, as well as the potential sunburn associated with exposure to the sun. On the other hand, the sentiment carries a more positive tone due to the proactive measure taken by the individual - shaving their beard to avoid facial tan lines. This action demonstrates that they have a plan in place to minimize their concerns regarding tan lines. Additionally, as it's a tweet, it could also be seen as a light-hearted or tongue-in-cheek commentary on their situation, which adds a positive or humorous twist to the sentiment.

Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

Here are possible answers to this question: - burn - changes color with seasons - turn brown - continue to grow - eat water I believe the correct choice is \\"continue to grow\\", here's why: A:","completion":"You are correct – the option \\"continue to grow\\" is the most accurate answer. When grass is provided with ample water and sunlight, it undergoes a process called photosynthesis. In this process, chlorophyll within the grass blades absorbs sunlight and uses it to convert water and carbon dioxide from the air into glucose and oxygen. Glucose is the source of energy for the grass, allowing it to grow and flourish. This growth takes place in cells at the base of the blades and the roots. The combination of light, water, and nutrients from the soil all contribute to healthy grass growth. Brown or burnt grass usually indicates a lack of one or more of these essential factors. In summary, when grass is given enough water and sunlight, it will efficiently perform photosynthesis and continue to grow stronger and healthier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student read more about a greater frequency of collisions? Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Sean, who studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions, read more about a greater frequency of collisions. This is because raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction due to the increased movement and speed of reactant particles. As a result, there is a greater frequency of collisions and a higher likelihood of overcoming the activation energy barrier to form products. Therefore, Sean's studies on temperature effects directly relate to the concept of a greater frequency of collisions in chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The Vienna Boys' Choir (German: Wiener Sangerknaben) or Vienna Choir Boys is a choir of boy sopranos and altos based in Vienna, Austria. It is one of the best known boys' choirs in the world. The boys are selected mainly from Austria, but also from many other countries. The choir is a private, not-for-profit organization. Gerald Wirth became the choir's artistic director in 2001. However, since then, the choir has come under pressure to modernize and has faced criticism of their musical standards, leading to a split with the Vienna State Opera. The choir has for the first time had to advertise for recruits after a rival choir school was established by Ioan Holender, director of the opera company. He complained of both falling standards and poor communication with the choir. He said that the State Opera sometimes trained boys for particular stage roles, only to find out on the day of performance that they were unavailable as they had gone on tour with the choir. Some boys were attracted to the rival choir school by the prospect of a more relaxed atmosphere and of performance fees being paid directly to them. The Vienna Boys' Choir has sought to update its image, recording pop music selections and adopting an alternative uniform to the sailor suits used since the 1920s, allowing the boys to dance as they sing. After Eugen Jesser died in May 2008, Walter Nettig became the choir's president. Gerald Wirth has been the artistic director since 2001, and he also became the choir's president in 2013. In 2010, following sexual abuse allegations from two former choristers stemming from the late 1960s and early 1980s, the Vienna Boys' Choir opened a confidential phone and e-mail hotline to allow others to come forward. Eight possible victims came forward saying they were abused, either by staff or other choir members.","completion":"This text is about the Vienna Boys' Choir (German: Wiener Sangerknaben), a choir of boy sopranos and altos based in Vienna, Austria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While there is a certain amount of humor in the online mockery, it is crucial to focus on the importance of the mission and how it adds to humanity's understanding of our universe. The Philae Probe's Decade-Long Mission Operated by European Space Agency (ESA), the Philae probe was launched in March 2004. After a decade in space, the lander reached its destination, Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, on November 12, 2014. The successful landing on a moving comet, a first for humanity, reflected the dedication and talent of countless scientists in an extraordinary international collaboration. Through its scientific instruments, Philae has collected valuable data and images to better comprehend the structure, composition, and history of comets. These insights are essential to understanding the origins of our solar system and the conditions existing at its birth. The mission is a crucial step forward in expanding our knowledge of the universe and our place within it. Unexpected Reaction: Memes and Mockery The Internet community, known for its propensity to create memes and jokes out of significant events, took little time to begin mocking the Philae probe's achievement. Soon after news of the successful landing surfaced, Twitter users began to use hashtag #LesserCometMilestones, highlighting less impressive accomplishments that humanity has yet to conquer. Some Twitter users sarcastically marveled at humanity's capability to land on a speeding comet but still not master the art of fixing a chipped tooth or creating everlasting cellphone batteries. Others took jabs at society's fascination with seemingly trivial matters, such as celebrity gossip and reality television shows, while downplaying the historic nature of the comet landing. The Need to Recognize and Celebrate Groundbreaking Achievement While the online response to Philae probe's landing on Comet 67P can be seen as mild sarcastic humor, it is essential to recognize the significance of such a scientific breakthrough. The Internet's propensity to overlook the importance of milestones like this landing is a reflection of society's sometimes skewed priorities. Philae's successful comet landing is a testament to humanity's determination and innovation in unlocking the mysteries of the universe. As we continue to explore the cosmos, it is crucial to focus on the remarkable achievements our scientists bring forth and to acknowledge their far-reaching implications for our understanding of the world around us. We have come so far in our quest to understand our place in the cosmos, and the landing of Philae probe on comet 67P is a prime example of this progress. Conclusion While the Internet may be a platform for humor and quick responses to world events, it is essential to separate the jokes from the reality of Philae's achievement. The historic landing on comet 67P is not just a scientific milestone, but a symbol of hope in our ongoing quest for knowledge, driving us to seek answers to some of the most vital existential questions. The monumental achievement should be embraced and celebrated, not just mocked by Internet users, reminding us that the cosmos and the mysteries it harbors are still very much a part of us all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

USA fends off Trinidad & Tobago for unconvincing win in World Cup qualifying Updated OCT 16, 2014 2:21a ET The United States women’s national team cleared its first hurdle toward the 2015 Women’s World Cup, but not by much, as it eked out a 1-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago in their 2014 CONCACAF Women’s Championship opener here on Wednesday night. Abby Wambach’s deft 55th minute header was the difference. The tournament, which will send three teams directly to Canada next summer and puts a fourth in a home-and-away playoff with Ecuador, gave the towering favorites immediate trouble in a vexing contest. For all their firepower and superior means, the Americans -- who practice year-round with elite coaches in state-of-the-art facilities, whereas the Trinidadians get just a week before tournaments on a shoestring budget -- had significant issues breaking through their opposition. Service, in the end, tended to fall short. And if it didn’t, the finishing did. “It’s a learning process with this group,” said USA head coach Jill Ellis, who has installed a new playing system and philosophy in recent months which has yet to fully take root. “We’re asking certain things of them. But sometimes when things don’t happen right away you get tight.” For the USA’s failings, however, Trinidad and Tobago was also entitled to a good deal of credit for its spirited performance. “If the people knew the plight that we’ve had and the struggles that we’ve had,” said head coach Randy Waldrum. “I’m extremely proud of the way the team played tonight.” The first half was one of both dominance and frustration for the Americans. They put Trinidad and Tobago under suffocating pressure, pinging the ball around deep in the opposing half. Distribution was quick and largely crisp – they completed 165 passes to Trinidad’s 28. The Trinidadians only ventured out on the rare breakaway and never got terribly close to endangering goalkeeper Hope Solo. But for a few brief flurries, the Socca Princesses contained the USA surprisingly well. As advertised, they sat deep and defended with a sound organization and sturdy physicality. Megan Rapinoe ran the show for the Americans early on, twice feeding Alex Morgan in dangerous positions within the first three minutes. A defender whiffed on her low cross to Wambach, doing enough to throw her off the chance. Rapinoe’s corner kick at Christen Press was headed right at goalkeeper Kimika Forbes. All of those chances materialized in the first quarter of an hour. It would be until late in the half before the Americans made another charge of note. Carli Lloyd ripped a shot at Forbes’ near post, which she pushed wide. On the ensuing corner, Press miss-hit her effort and Wambach tried to head it on backward, with no luck. On the brink of halftime, Rapinoe hit a very long shot, which dinked off the bottom of the cross bar before going out off of Forbes. Wambach was then denied on the goal line with the header off the corner. Following the intermission, the USA cranked up the pressure further, hoping to crush any budding hopes of T&T pulling off some kind of historic upset. Wambach immediately knocked down a ball for Morgan, but she pummeled her shot over. Wambach then nodded a Megan Klingenberg cross just wide before seeing Forbes save her one-on-one effort, after which Rapinoe blasted the rebound many yards over the mostly-open goal. At length, the Americans broke the surprising resistance. Morgan ran at goal and, once she was deep into the box, took the ball wide. She chipped it to Wambach at the far post. Forbes got a touch to it, but not enough to prevent it from looping to the tall American striker. The world-record holder for international goals took her time to judge the angles as the ball arced toward her and nodded the ball through the scampering defenders and into the net. The relief was palpable as otherwise stoic head coach Jill Ellis rose to her feet on the bench, looked skyward and pumped both fists. “From our perspective, it was frustrating,” said Wambach. “Their goalie basically stood on her head, she had a fantastic game. She kept them in the game until the end. We just couldn’t break them down. We were, on the final chance, the final pass, just a little bit off.” The Americans would conjure many more chances, but they refused to give themselves some breathing room. Wambach was denied one-on-one again by the outstanding Forbes, who was surely the player of the game. Sydney Leroux also found herself denied by Forbes. Trinidad, for their part, grew surer in their attacks and carved out some looks of their own. The score, in the end, was far tighter than it needed to be, given that the Americans outshot their opponents 28 to 6 and put 10 shots on goal to Trinidad’s one. “We have to fix the problems, we have to fix the issues that made it so difficult for us to score goals,” said Wambach. In the end the job was done. And that’s all that the points column in the Group A standings will reflect. What was this article about?","completion":"The article is about the United States Women's national soccer team's match against Trinidad and Tobago in the 2014 CONCACAF Women's Championship opener. The U.S. team secured a narrow 1-0 victory, with Abby Wambach scoring the only goal in the 55th minute. The match was crucial for both sides, as this championship tournament would determine the teams representing the region at the 2015 Women's World Cup. Despite the superior resources and level of play exhibited by the American team, Trinidad and Tobago proved to be a difficult and well-organized opponent. The match was hard-fought, and the U.S. faced challenges in penetrating the opposition's defense. However, the U.S. team emerged victorious, albeit with a less convincing performance than expected. U.S. head coach Jill Ellis acknowledged the learning process her team was undergoing, with a new playing system and philosophy that had yet to be fully implemented. On the other side, Trinidad and Tobago's head coach Randy Waldrum expressed his pride in his team's spirited performance, considering their limited resources and preparation time prior to the tournament. Throughout the match, the U.S. created numerous scoring opportunities but struggled with finishing. In the end, their narrow victory can be attributed to both Wambach's timely goal and several impressive saves by Trinidad and Tobago's goalkeeper, Kimika Forbes. The article concludes that while the U.S. team's performance might not have been as dominant as expected, they still managed to secure the win and move forward in the tournament with valuable points added to their Group A standings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As Edric settles into the village and witnesses their pagan rituals, he feels a strong calling to help the villagers find salvation and redemption through Christianity. In his attempts to convert the villagers, Edric faces numerous obstacles, including the suspicion and hostility of the village elders, who see his beliefs as a threat to their way of life. They are especially threatened by Edric's rapidly growing bond with 'Liliana', the daughter of the village chief. Liliana is an intelligent and curious young woman who is drawn to Edric's message and begins to question her own beliefs. Eventually, they fall in love, which further complicates Edric's mission to bring Christianity to the village. Throughout the movie, Edric works tirelessly to gain the trust of the villagers by helping them solve their problems, heal their sick, and improve their lives through the teachings of Christianity. He does this while constantly grappling with his own doubts, fears, and internal conflicts. As the movie progresses, the village faces a series of significant events, including a severe drought and a deadly disease outbreak. Edric leads the villagers through these trials, emphasizing the power of faith and prayer. Their success in overcoming adversity eventually softens the villagers' hearts, and they begin to embrace Christianity. However, the movie takes a dark turn when the village's pagan priests feel threatened by the rapid spread of Christianity and conspire to regain power. They frame Edric for a gruesome crime, leading to his arrest and imminent execution. In a climactic sequence, Liliana bravely confronts her father and the village elders, pleading for Edric's life and revealing the priests' conspiracy. The chief reluctantly investigates the matter and, in a shocking twist, discovers that the priests were indeed behind the crime to maintain their grip on the village. He has the priests arrested and professes his newfound faith in Christianity. Edric is freed, and the village eventually converts to Christianity, ushering in a new era of unity and prosperity. The movie ends with Edric and Liliana getting married in the village's first Christian church, symbolizing the triumph of faith and love over fear and superstition. Their love story serves as an anchor for the greater story of spiritual transformation, showing that redemption can be found even in the most isolated corners of the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Dustin Miller (born May 2, 1977), best known by his stage name D-Loc, is an MC in the rap rock group Kottonmouth Kings and rap group Kingspade.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

Manafort was charged with 12 counts, including conspiracy against the United States and money laundering related to his work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. His longtime deputy, Rick Gates, was charged as well. The indictment did not include any references to the Trump, the campaign or collusion. But the special prosector accused Manafort of trying to hide his work in Ukraine — and millions of dollars in payments from it— from around 2006 to 2017. That undercuts Trump's claim the charges stemmed from actions that only occurred \\"years ago.\\" Many believe Mueller could use the charges to try and pry information from Manafort about whether the campaign colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 election. Trump allies and lawyers have expressed confidence Manafort will not reveal damaging information about Trump or his team in a deal with prosecutors. The president, however, has not responded to a guilty plea unsealed Monday made by former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What does Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse need to hear in order to move? Answer the above question based on the context below: Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

Q:Oil is formed by layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae, and fossil fuels like coal and oil are ancient biomass fuel. Given these facts, what is a product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time among the following options: - Fungus - Greenhouse gases - Fossil fuels - Calcium carbonate - salinity - Sand - contamination - Water A:","completion":"A product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time among the given options is fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbon deposits formed through geological processes acting on the remains of ancient biomass for millions of years. These geological processes typically involve a combination of heat, pressure, and time acting upon deceased plants, such as algae, and, in some cases, animal remains. Algae, for instance, were abundant in the prehistoric oceans and sequestered large amounts of carbon on the ocean floor when they died. Over millions of years, layers of sediment accumulated on top of these dead organisms, exerting tremendous pressure and causing their carbon content to become concentrated. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal forms from the remains of terrestrial plants in swampy environments, while oil and natural gas form primarily from marine organisms, including algae. Throughout an extended period, the heat and pressure from these layers of sediment convert organic matter into different hydrocarbons. Oil, a liquid fossil fuel, is created when organic-rich sediment is subjected to heat and pressure over millions of years. This process results in the formation of a substance called kerogen, which ultimately transforms into crude oil at even higher temperatures and pressures. The crude oil then migrates through porous rocks, such as sandstone, and accumulates in reservoirs where it can be extracted and refined to produce various petroleum products like gasoline, diesel, and lubricants. In conclusion, among the given options, fossil fuels are the product of layers of sediment pushing down on decomposing algae over time. The process of forming fossil fuels takes millions of years and is the result of heat, pressure and time acting upon ancient organic materials, including algae. These fossil fuels, once extracted and refined, are used as a primary energy source for various industrial and domestic applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thank you for the kind words and support. pic.twitter.com/6B2dO6OvOx — RMCH Charity (@RMCHcharity) May 25, 2017 The queen issued a statement quickly after the attack, saying, “The whole nation has been shocked.” “I know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured,” the statement read. ||||| Queen Elizabeth made a surprise visit to a children’s hospital that is treating many of the young victims of the horrific tragedy that followed the Ariana Grande concert on Monday, telling one patient that the suicide bombing was “dreadful” and “very wicked.” The monarch arrived at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital at around 11:20 a.m. Thursday, shortly after Britain had fallen silent for a minute in tribute to the dead and injured as well as their families and loved ones. Queen Elizabeth told 14-year-old Evie Mills, who received the concert tickets a birthday present, and her parents, “It’s dreadful. Very wicked. To target that sort of thing,” The Telegraph reports. The Queen reassured them that “everyone is united” following the attack. She then told the teen that she thought Ariana Grande was a “very good singer,” adding: “She sounds very, very good.” The Queen also met with Millie Robson, 15, who wore an Ariana Grande T-shirt as her surprise guest asked if she enjoyed the concert prior to the attack. The teen then shared that she had won VIP passes and met the pop star backstage. The royal visitor wished Millie a quick recovery.

Emily Murrell, 12, missed the Queen’s visit due to a surgery. Her mother Ruth, who was also recovering in the hospital after being hit with shrapnel when the bomb went off, said her daughter would be disappointed. Queen Elizabeth also met 12-year-old Amy Barlow and her mother, Kathy. Twenty-two people died, many of them teens and children, and around 75 were injured in the attack at Manchester Arena on Monday. REX/Shutterstock REX/Shutterstock In a brief tour, the Queen met doctors, nurses and others who have helped save lives in the days since Monday’s attack. The Queen also met the head of the National Health Service trust and the chief nurse and the chief executive. “The awful thing was that everyone was so young. The age of them,” she told one member of the staff. The hospital is one of the most important in the U.K. and treats 200,000 people a year.

Investigators suspect the attack was carried out by Salman Abedi, 22, who detonated an improvised explosive device and died at the scene, Hopkins said. According to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant communication, ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack. ||||| In a few simple words during a visit to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital to meet the young victims of the terrorist bombing, the Queen encapsulated the horror of an attack that has left the nation reeling. “It’s dreadful, very wicked, to target that sort of thing,” the Queen said to 14-year-old schoolgirl Evie Mills, who she met lying on her hospital bed with a teddy by her side, and a blanket shrouding her injured chest and legs. The Queen later added as she toured the children's ward viewing at first hand the carnage of Monday night's attack: “the awful thing was that everyone was so young.” During her 65 years of reign, the Queen has occasionally made visits to hospital to help lead the nation in moments of national grieving. She did so after the 7/7 terror attacks in London and also to meet servicemen and women injured fighting for their country. But never have so many children been among the victims. There are 14 inpatients remaining at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital following the attack, including five in critical care. Among those continuing to recover from their injuries in the hospital was Millie Robson, 15, from Co Durham, who was still wearing her Ariana Grande concert t-shirt that she had specially chosen for the concert at the Manchester Arena. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Queen Elizabeth II visited a children's hospital in Manchester to meet with young survivors of the terrible event that happened after an Ariana Grande concert.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining .","completion":"To determine whether the following phrase is considered positive or negative, let's break down the sentence and analyze the individual elements or words that give it a connotation. Phrase: \\"Exposé, the film (at 80 minutes) is actually quite entertaining.\\" 1. \\"Exposé\\" - This word suggests a revealing film, which can be neutral, absent any further context. 2. \\"the film (at 80 minutes)\\" - This part provides information about the duration of the film, which is also neutral. 3. \\"is actually\\" - The word \\"actually\\" often acts as a surprise or contradiction to a pre-conceived notion. It can imply that despite any potential doubts, the information that follows is reassuring, potentially making the statement positive. 4. \\"quite entertaining\\" - This part describes the film in a positive way, as \\"entertaining\\" is a complimentary adjective. Based on the analysis, the phrase \\"exposé, the film (at 80 minutes) is actually quite entertaining\\" contains both neutral and positive words. However, the core sentiment expressed in this sentence is positive, as it explicitly describes the film as \\"quite entertaining.\\" Therefore, the overall connotation of the phrase can be considered positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close Movie plot: Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who suffers from Asperger syndrome, is the son of German American Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks).[5] Thomas would often send Oskar on missions to do something involving one of his riddles. The last riddle he ever gives Oskar is proof that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar who is told \\"If things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding\\". On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the World Trade Center. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, although Oskar is present to answer this call, he is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the building collapses. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out. A few weeks after what Oskar calls \\"the worst day,\\" he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, \\"So do I\\". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him. A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word \\"Black\\" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black (Viola Davis), who has recently divorced her husband.

The newsreel is accompanied by ragtime pianist Coalhouse Walker, Jr. (Howard E. Rollins, Jr.).The millionaire industrialist Harry Kendall Thaw (Robert Joy) makes a scene when White's latest creation, a nude statue on the roof of Madison Square Garden, is unveiled. The model for the statue is Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern), a former chorus girl who is now Thaw's wife. Thaw becomes convinced White has corrupted Evelyn and humiliated him. On the evening of June 25, 1906, Thaw confronts and publicly shoots White during a show at Madison Square Garden, killing him in cold blood before several witnesses. Thaw surrenders to the police without attempting to run.Meanwhile, an unnamed family resides in a comfortable suburban home in New Rochelle. The family's Father (James Olson) owns a factory, where his wife's Younger Brother (Brad Dourif) is employed as a fireworks maker. Their passive, sheltered existence is disturbed when an abandoned African American baby is found in their garden. The child's mother, an unmarried washerwoman named Sarah (Debbie Allen), is discovered, and brought to their home. When she learns that the police intend to charge Sarah with child abandonment and attempted murder, Mother (Mary Steenburgen) intervenes and takes Sarah and her child into the home, despite Father's objections. Some time later, Coalhouse Walker arrives at the house in search of Sarah, driving a new model T-Ford and acting in a brash manner unlike the subservient attitude expected of the African American community at the time.

While the afternoon sun cast its golden rays upon the vivid flora of the garden, the gardener trudged along a meandering footpath, diligently pushing his rickety wooden cart. The wheels creaked, bearing the weight of the water barrels nestled comfortably within. Weary yet resolute, he wiped the sweat from his brow, determined to complete the task at hand. The garden, a true masterpiece of nature, was a labor of love for the humble gardener. Its variety of flowers, from elegant roses to whimsical daffodils, lent their colors to the landscape, gently painting it with life. Ornately carved hedges danced in the subtle breeze, their delicate green details evoking a symphony of shapes. Majestic trees, some towering tall while others gracefully curved, provided a serenade of leaves as their branches swayed above. At the heart of this Eden, a serene pond awaited the gardener's attention. Its tranquil waters, teeming with fish of every hue, served as an oasis for his hardworking hours, offering relief and solace. On this particular day, the pond had started to decline, its water levels having dipped slightly due to gradual evaporation and thirsty creatures who ventured close to drink. Aware that the pond's inhabitants and surrounding flora relied on its nourishing waters, the gardener saw it as his duty to refill the gem of his garden. As he approached the pond, his hands steadied the cart's wooden frame, careful not to spill a single drop. One by one, he stretched his sinewy arms, grasping the barrels with vigor and pouring their contents into the waiting pond. The water splashed gently upon the surface, merging with the shimmering hues of reds, blues, and yellows reflected on the watery canvas. He watched as the water level slowly began to rise, revitalizing the pond's ecosystem. A school of fishes near the edge darted into deeper waters, their scales sparkling like tiny prisms in the sunlight. Dragonflies zipped about, skimming the water's surface as their wings caught wind, seeking out newfound hideaways amongst the reeds. Even the chorus of frogs, once silenced by the vanishing water, serenaded the gardener with excitable croaks, grateful for the restored depth. As the gardener emptied the final barrel, the water in the pond reached its usual level. His eyes scanned the fullness of the pond, a gratified smile gracing his weary face. The garden had once again returned to its harmonious balance, a vibrant symphony of colors, sounds, and life. Knowing his task had been accomplished, the gardener took a moment to savor the view, allowing the satisfaction from a job well done to wash over him. With renewed determination, he pushed the now-empty cart away from the pond, already planning his next gardening endeavor. As the sun dipped lower in the sky, the gardener continued to tend to his beloved creation, ensuring the beauty and health of the garden was safeguarded for both current and future generations to enjoy. For the gardener knew that his work was not just a responsibility, but a calling, fulfilling his soul and breathing life into his small piece of paradise."},{"prompt":"Q: Title: So far so good Review: Great production, great workout and inspiring on so many levels.

Here is a hypothesis: Think about all the stupid things. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it's essential to first understand their individual meanings and potential implications. Premise: \\"Stop thinking stupid thoughts.\\" This statement suggests an instruction or advice to halt or avoid engaging in thoughts that are considered to be \\"stupid\\" or irrational. It implies that the person receiving this advice has, in the past, engaged in such thoughts and the speaker believes this practice should cease or at least be minimized. As a premise, it sets a foundation for a potential conclusion. Hypothesis: \\"Think about all the stupid things.\\" This statement proposes that one should engage in thoughts about irrational or \\"stupid\\" things. Unlike the premise, it actively encourages the contemplation of these types of thoughts. A hypothesis typically proposes an idea that may be explored or tested, but in this case, it seems to contradict the premise. Now, let's analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis or if the truth of the premise leads to the truth of the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis seem to be contradicting each other. If we assume the premise is true, which means we should stop thinking about stupid things, it does not support the hypothesis that encourages us to think about all the stupid things. As a result, one cannot conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true as well. To better illustrate this using formal logic, let's assign variables to the statements: 1. Premise: ¬P (the negation of thinking stupid thoughts, i.e., stop thinking stupid thoughts) 2. Hypothesis: Q (think about all stupid things) We want to determine if the following argument is valid: 1. ¬P (premise) 2. Therefore, Q (conclusion, which is the hypothesis in this case) To evaluate the validity of this argument, we can construct a truth table for the possible values of P and Q. Let's assume 'T' stands for true and 'F' stands for false. P | Q | ¬P - | - | -- T | T | F T | F | F F | T | T F | F | T As we can see, there is no row in the truth table where ¬P (the premise) being true leads to Q (the hypothesis) being true. In other words, the truth of the premise does not necessitate the truth of the hypothesis. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine that if the premise \\"Stop thinking stupid thoughts\\" is true, then the hypothesis \\"Think about all the stupid things\\" is also true, as the two statements contradict one another, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Repeat this setence, but with the correct capitalization.","completion":"But we need to develop common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU - otherwise, you could find yourself crossing from France to Germany without being able to refuel. In recent years, the European Union has been working towards a more sustainable future, with electric vehicles (EVs) playing a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the increased demand for EVs, it has become evident that a harmonized approach is necessary for the development and deployment of supporting infrastructure, like electric charging points. The lack of common basic standards for electric charging points can create several issues. Firstly, it hinders the seamless cross-border travel for EV users, as they may not be able to recharge their vehicles when moving from one country to another, leading to logistical difficulties and inconveniences. Secondly, the absence of standardization may result in higher costs for both installation and maintenance of these charging points, as businesses and governments may have to adopt different technologies and systems to suit their specific needs. In this context, the development of common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU offers numerous benefits: 1. Improved connectivity: A standardized system would ensure that all EVs, regardless of their brand or country of origin, can recharge at any charging point in the EU, eliminating the need for drivers to carry multiple charging adapters or memberships with different charging networks. 2. Reduced costs: By implementing a uniform standard, economies of scale can be realized, potentially lowering the costs related to installation, maintenance, and usage of electric charging points. This is particularly relevant for governments and businesses that are contributing to the expansion of charging infrastructure. 3. Enhanced innovation: With a common framework in place, manufacturers and service providers can focus on improving efficiency, speed, and customer experience instead of dealing with compatibility issues. This could, in turn, stimulate further innovation and competition in the EV charging market. 4. Regulatory compliance: Creating common basic standards would simplify regulatory compliance for industry participants, as they would only need to adhere to a single set of rules and requirements rather than dealing with multiple inconsistent standards. 5. Greater consumer confidence: Lastly, standardization would boost consumer confidence in electric mobility, as it eliminates the concern of limited charging options while traveling within the EU. To achieve these benefits, the EU could pursue a collaborative approach by engaging stakeholders, including automakers, charging point operators, standards organizations, and government bodies. This would help in developing a comprehensive strategy encompassing technical specifications, communication protocols, and user authentication methods, ensuring seamless interconnectivity and ease of use across the EU's electric charging network. In conclusion, the development and adoption of common basic standards for electric charging points across the EU is of paramount importance to facilitate the growth of electric vehicles, promote a shift towards cleaner transportation, and contribute to a greener, more sustainable future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This has been a decision that has not only sparked massive protests across the country, but it has also driven enraged demonstrators to ransack the President's office. In a country where churning political waters have been an unsettling norm for the past few years, the pardon granted by the Macedonian president has become a lightning rod for accumulated frustration. Political instability, disillusionment, and skepticism about the Macedonian government have found an expressive outlet in the protests that have enveloped the country following President Ivanov's pardon. The wire-tapping scandal initially brought the already vulnerable political setup in Macedonia under increased scrutiny and pressure. The scandal revealed what was referred to as a potentially 'massive invasion of privacy,' with thousands of conversations being illegally recorded by the government. To many, the pardon has acted as a smokescreen, protecting those at the helm of this controversial affair from facing due punishment. President Ivanov's decision to excuse these political figures has been comprehended as a gross display of impunity. It conveyed to protesters the underlying message that individuals in positions of power could evade justice, a scenario that couldn't be more perilous for a country yearning for political stabilization and transparent leadership. The protesters' decision to break into and vandalize the President's office further underscores their level of resentment and disapproval. Such drastic measure reflects the people's deep-felt sense of betrayal and disappointment. Demonstrators come across as individuals who, feeling unheard and unhappy with the status quo, have taken it upon themselves to make a bold and unequivocal statement against the pardoning action. International observers and human rights organizations express concern over both the act of pardoning the implicated politicians and the violent demonstrations. There has been emphasis on the importance of justice and order in Macedonia, both by holding those responsible for the wire-tapping scandal to account, and by protesters voicing their dissent in peaceful and democratic ways. The incident has also caught the attention of the EU and the US, both prompting for the restoration of the rule of law and democracy in Macedonia. There are fears that the ongoing friction could destabilize the Balkan region, already a hotbed for political and sociological tensions. It is also hinted that this incident could potentially push Macedonia further away from its aspiration towards European integration. Whether President Ivanov's controversial decision to pardon the figures involved in the wire-tapping scandal will prove to be the final straw for the Macedonian people, or whether it is merely another episode in the unfurling political drama of the country, remains to be seen. But one thing is clear - the Macedonian masses have shown through these protests that they are not ready to stand silent in the face of perceived grave injustices. The ransacking of the President's office suggests a need for a profound and immediate change in the nation's political establishment. It is a wake-up call to the ruling elites, a sign that there are only so many indiscretions and alleged acts of corruption that they can brush under the proverbial carpet before the public takes matters into its own hands. The future of Macedonia hangs in the balance, as the unfolding events will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping its political landscape.

Title: Pathology Movie plot: The intro shows a camera recording faces of corpses, with their mouths being moved by medical students. Med school student Teddy Grey (Milo Ventimiglia) graduates top of his class from Harvard and joins one of the nationâs most prestigious pathology programs. There, a rivalry develops between a group of interns and Teddy. They invite him into their group, which entertains itself with a secret after-hours game at the morgue of who can commit the perfect undetectable murder. Eventually the group's leader, Jake Gallo, realizes that Teddy is sleeping with his girlfriend, Dr. Juliette Bath. When Teddy catches several members of the group in lies, he realizes that what initially seemed like vigilante killings are, in actuality, just innocent people murdered for sport. Teddy's fiancÃ©e Gwen arrives to stay with him in his apartment. Gallo, angered by Juliette's infidelity, kills her for the next game. However, just as they are about to begin the autopsy on Bath (in the meantime plotting Teddy's death), Gallo realizes that the gas has been left on in the room, resulting in a massive explosion as one of the group lights a meth pipe, killing everyone but Teddy who was not in the room. Gallo realizes what is about to happen and survives. Teddy is seen walking away from the explosion. Later, Gallo manages to kill Gwen in what he believes to be the \\"perfect murder\\". Upon completing his autopsy report on his murdered fiancÃ©e, Teddy is knocked out by Gallo and then is forced to trade verbal barbs with him. Teddy uses some of Gallo's own rhetoric against him in reverse psychology fashion, after which fellow pathologist Ben Stravinsky frees Teddy and together they kill Gallo in exactly the same way that he killed Teddy's fiancÃ©e. In the process, they vivisect Gallo. Answer:","completion":"Teddy and Ben Stravinsky kill Gallo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a more detailed answer: Hepatitis C is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which mainly affects the liver. It is primarily transmitted through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. Transmission can occur due to: 1. Sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment. 2. Receiving contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, or organ transplants, especially before 1992, when widespread screening of blood supplies began. 3. Accidental needlestick injuries in healthcare settings. 4. Sharing personal items, such as razors or toothbrushes, that may have come into contact with the infected person's blood. 5. Having tattoos or piercings done with non-sterile equipment. 6. Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth, although this is less common. 7. Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person, though this is much less common than other transmission methods.

A:","completion":"To prepare a steak on the grill, follow these steps: Step 1: Select and prepare the steak Choose a high-quality steak with good marbling (fat distribution) for better flavor and tenderness. Common cuts for grilling include ribeye, New York strip, or filet mignon. Let the steak reach room temperature by removing it from the refrigerator about 30-60 minutes before grilling. This helps it cook evenly. Step 2: Preheat the grill Clean the grill grates to remove any residue or debris. Then, preheat the grill to medium-high heat, around 400-450°F (204-232°C). Preheating ensures a good sear and prevents the steak from sticking to the grill grates. Step 3: Season the steak While the grill is preheating, season the steak. Since steak has a rich, meaty flavor, simple seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper is usually enough. Apply a generous amount to both sides of the steak, patting it in gently to ensure it adheres. Step 4: Oil the grill grates To prevent the steak from sticking, lightly oil the grill grates using a high smoke point oil such as vegetable or grapeseed oil. Dip a paper towel into the oil and, using tongs, rub it over the heated grates. Step 5: Grill the steak Place the seasoned steak on the preheated grill grates. Let it cook undisturbed to create a nice sear and grill marks. For medium-rare, cook the steak for about 3-4 minutes per side. For medium, cook about 4-5 minutes per side. Adjust the cooking time according to your desired steak doneness. Step 6: Check for doneness Use a meat thermometer to verify the internal temperature of the steak. For medium-rare, aim for 130-135°F (54-57°C), and for medium, shoot for 135-140°F (57-60°C). Grill temperatures can vary, so using a thermometer helps ensure accurate results. Step 7: Rest the steak Once the steak reaches the desired internal temperature, remove it from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board or plate for about 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the steak, resulting in a more tender and flavorful bite. Step 8: Slice and serve After resting, slice the steak against the grain and serve it with your favorite side dishes. Enjoy your grilled steak!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Action on Sugar analysed 131 hot drinks and found a third contained at least as much sugar as a can of Pepsi or Coca-Cola, which contains nine teaspoons. The charity said in some of the worst cases the drinks contained 20 or more teaspoons of sugar. Coffee shop chains Starbucks, Costa and Caffe Nero said they were committed to reducing sugar content in their drinks. The drinks assessed included flavoured coffees such as mochas and lattes, hot fruit drinks and hot chocolates from coffee shops and fast food chains. The charity found that 98% of the drinks tested would receive a red nutritional value label for high sugar content. The recommended maximum intake of added sugar per day for those aged 11 and over is about 30g or seven teaspoons, the NHS says. Starbucks' venti Grape with Chai, Orange and Cinnamon Hot Mulled Fruit was found to have the highest sugar content of the drinks tested, with 25 teaspoons of sugar per serving, the campaign group said. Costa's massimo eat-in Chai Latte was found to contain 20 teaspoons of sugar and Starbucks' venti White Chocolate Mocha with Whipped Cream was found to have 18. KFC's mocha and Starbucks' Signature Hot Chocolate both had 15 teaspoons of sugar per serving while Caffe Nero's drink-in Caramelatte had 13. The group's researcher Kawther Hashem called on coffee shop chains to reduce the amount of sugar in their drinks, improve their labelling and scrap extra-large serving sizes. \\"These hot flavoured drinks should be an occasional treat, not an everyday drink,\\" she said. \\"They are laden with an unbelievable amount of sugar and calories and are often accompanied by a high sugar and fat snack.\\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was \\"surprised\\" by the results, and said the campaign group had tested only the larger portion sizes on offer. Case study: Mark Cresswell from London \\"I used to drink a large white cafe mocha with caramel and vanilla syrup, cream on top, caramel and chocolate drizzle at Starbucks - approximately three times a day, seven days a week. \\"I did this for about a year. At the time, I knew this drink had lots of sugar and fat, but I wasn't aware of just how much. \\"At one point the assistant manager refused to serve me because they were concerned of the health impact. The rest of the staff continued to serve me. \\"I drastically cut back on these sugary drinks after I was diagnosed with a very high cholesterol level and liver problems three years ago. \\"I still have high cholesterol now and was recently diagnosed with a fatty liver - which means it is not working properly - not from alcohol but from sugar. \\"While I believe we should all take responsibility for our health, I do feel that coffee shops which allow their customers to customise their drinks to extreme levels are not helping.\\" Professor Graham MacGregor, Action on Sugar chairman, said the group's report highlighted \\"yet again another example of scandalous amounts of sugar added to our food and drink\\". \\"No wonder we have the highest rates of obesity in Europe,\\" he said. A Starbucks spokeswoman said the chain had \\"committed to reduce added sugar\\" by 25% by the end of 2020 in its \\"indulgent drinks\\". \\"We also offer a wide variety of lighter options, sugar-free syrups and sugar-free natural sweetener and we display all nutritional information in-store and online,\\" she said. Kerry Parkin, Costa's head of communications, said the chain had already taken \\"significant steps\\" to reduce the sugar content of its drinks. The company would be setting salt and sugar reduction targets for 2020, she said. A Caffe Nero spokeswoman said: \\"We have already made changes to reduce the sugar content of some of our iced drinks for summer 2016 by over 10%. \\"In addition, we offer sugar free syrups for many drinks, and all nutritional information is available on our website so that customers can make an informed choice.

The early scenes of the film show him filming his conversation in the hospital with his dying grandfather. Through the eyes of Simon we see the grandfather as a caring, wise man, while through the perspective of his uncle we see the racist, backwards side. Simon's grandfather hated Simon's father and claims that he intended to kill Simon's mother in the car crash when, as Simon finds out at the film's conclusion, he had an eye condition. This condition prevented him from being able to drive at night, as the glare from oncoming headlights would blind him. The evening of the car crash reveals a different side of the story, causing the memories of each character to meet head on, connecting disparate stories of each character to unite in an Egoyanesque conclusion.Simon's family narrative is cleverly knit into a news story presented to Simon by his high school French teacher as a translation exercise. An article is read by the teacher about an attempted bombing of an aircraft by a man who put explosives in his pregnant wife's luggage. Simon gets the idea to translate the story and write it from the perspective of the child in the woman's womb. The teacher encourages Simon to develop his story as a drama exercise, however Simon presents it to the class and to the world via the Internet as if he really was that child. The teacher's silence, as we find out later, is owing to her relationship with Simon's late father who died, with his mother, in a car crash when he was still a child. The narrative of the car crash and the attempted bombing of the plane become intertwined as a way for the characters to deal with their past experiences, which they have all been trying to deny.The film is about a search for identity in a digital age where the truth is oftentimes irrelevant. Simon's story of his suicide bomber father is met on the Internet with sympathy, anger, and even support as we see a skinhead on webcam telling Simon that his father was a hero....

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the title of Nielsen's third cantata? , can you please find it? Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act Saul og David (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by Einar Christiansen, tells the Biblical story of Saul's jealousy of the young David while Maskarade (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish libretto by Vilhelm Andersen, based on the comedy by Ludvig Holberg. Saul and David received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 Masquerade was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many strophic songs, its dances and its underlying \\"old Copenhagen\\" atmosphere.Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed Hymnus amoris (Hymn of Love), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper Dannebrog, Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \\"a decisive victory\\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of Nationaltidende welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the Berlingske Tidende reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. Søvnen (The Sleep), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. Fynsk Foraar (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside. Answer:","completion":"The title of Nielsen's third cantata is \\"Fynsk Foraar\\" (Springtime on Funen), Op. 42, which was completed in 1922.

If you are familiar with the antics of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit-man named Brand Hauser who finds himself in Turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target. While there he finds himself intrigued by the anti-establishment reporter played by Marisa Tomei and pursued by the over-sexualized pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him (and played hilariously by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played suitably over the top, they aren't always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise. All the principals turn in solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her Disney image. Tomei is funny but understated while the Cusack's own nearly every scene they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns it's way to the expected conclusion.

Pick out any shriveled or irregular beans and discard them.","completion":"Ok, after we soak the beans overnight and rinse them, here's what we'll do next: 1. Put the beans in a big pot: Carefully pour the rinsed beans into a large pot. Remember we removed those not-so-good beans, so we only have the nice and clean beans! 2. Add lots of water: Pour enough water into the pot so that it covers the beans by about 2 inches. Just like when you take a nice bath, the beans need enough water to swim around. 3. Turn on the heat: Ask an adult to help you set the stove to medium heat. We want our beans to cook slowly and gently, not too fast. 4. Add some flavor friends: You can make your beans taste even better by adding some salt, chopped onions, garlic, or maybe some diced carrots. Just choose the ones you like! 5. Let it simmer: When the water starts to bubble a little bit, it’s time to turn the heat down to low. This way, our beans can cook slowly. Put a lid on the pot but leave a little gap open so steam can escape. 6. Check on the beans: You'll need to cook the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours, but you should check them every 30 minutes to make sure they have enough water. If the water is getting low, add some more to the pot. 7. Test if the beans are soft: After about 1.5 hours, take out a bean with a spoon and blow on it to cool it down. Give it a gentle squish with your fingers or taste it. If it's soft and ready to eat, it's done! If not, just let the beans cook a bit longer. 8. Enjoy your delicious beans: Once the beans are soft and cooked, you can ask an adult to help you turn off the stove. Scoop the beans into a bowl and enjoy them as a side dish or add them into your favorite recipe! Remember, always ask an adult for help when using the stovetop or dealing with hot pots and pans.

Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Sami Mokbel. Sportsmail understands Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain was in Porto on Thursday to watch French centre half Eliaquim Mangala in action. Read the full story on the £20m-rated centre back HERE. Manchester City want to buy British this summer as they struggle to keep hold of their homegrown stars. The club are identifying summer targets to satisfy Premier League rules on homegrown players, with Southampton full back Luke Shaw, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles in their sights. City nominated nine homegrown players in their squad at the start of the season but face losing several of them this summer. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez on Ross Barkley's ability. Midfielder: Ross Barkley. Full-back: Luke Shaw. Defender: Jamaal Lascelles. Wonderkid: Ross Barkley (L) has been earning rave reviews for Everton, including this goal against Newcastle. Luke who's talking: Southampton defender Shaw has also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea. Best defence: Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles could be needed to replace departing homegrown players. And, although the 2012 Premier League. champions are closing in on £20m-rated Porto centre back Eliaquim. Mangala, don't expect too many more exports in the summer. Central defender Joleon Lescott will leave when his contract expires. Likewise, Micah Richards is not prepared to sign a new, five-year deal. Richards has struggled for games under Manuel Pellegrini, yet the club are keen to keep him and Sportsmail understands the right back has been offered an increase on his £80,000-a-week deal to stay. Feeling unwanted: City defender Joleon Lescott (R) is expected to leave at the end of the season. Not about the money: Micah Richards has been offered an increase to stay but wants more playing time. What shall we do? Youngsters Jack Rodwell and Deryck Boyota are also considering their futures. Premier League clubs must include no more than 17 non-homegrown players over the age of 21 in their squads of 25. Homegrown players are defined as players trained by their club, or another in the same country, for at least three years between 15 and 21. There is no obligation to put a certain number of them in a match-day squad.Why were the rules brought in?There was concern that the richest clubs would stockpile the best players to the detriment of developing their own youngsters. The 25-year-old’s contract does not expire until the end of next season, but City may look to sell him in a cut-price deal this summer to avoid losing him for nothing in 2015. Liverpool, Arsenal and AC Milan are monitoring the situation. Dedryck Boyata, who qualifies as homegrown even though he is Belgian, has also been offered a new deal despite playing only one league game this season. However, the defender is understood to be hugely reluctant to re-sign given his lack of playing time and is also likely to leave. City chiefs will open talks with James Milner — whose contract expires next season — before the World Cup, but the England forward wants assurances over his playing time before agreeing to an extension. Play me! James Milner wants assurances before he commits to a new contract at the Etihad. Stunted growth: Rodwell has struggled to displace stars like Vincent Kompany since moving from Everton. Pecking order: Alex Nimely may be tempted to move with the likes of Sergio Aguero ahead of him. The future of striker Alex Nimely, 22, is also unclear given that his contract expires this summer, while Jack Rodwell is known to be considering his future at the Etihad Stadium. Midfielder Gareth Barry, on loan at Everton, will definitely be leaving while Serbia defender Matija Nastasic will be counted as an overseas player next season, having turned 21 last month. Behind the scenes, the potential lack of homegrown talent is a concern and buying British is likely to be a necessity for City. Sporting director Txiki Begiristain is well aware of the problem and City’s network of scouts are working hard to identify targets. One of ours: Matija Nastasic will be considered a homegrown player next season having turned 21 last month. Sticking with Toffees? Gareth Barry is certain to leave after spending the season on loan with Everton. Warning signs! Scott Sinclair (L) was offloaded after barely featuring during his short spell at City. However, persuading the likes of Shaw, 18, Barkley, 20, and Lascelles, 20, that they can fulfil their footballing potential at City might prove a further stumbling block. You only need look at how some City buys have fared to understand why they might be cautious. Scott Sinclair and Rodwell arrived from Swansea and Everton respectively in 2012 but have struggled to make an impact. Sinclair has been shipped out on loan to West Bromwich Albion while Rodwell has found first-team football hard to come by, partly due to injury, and has made only seven Premier League starts. Head to head: Jose Mourinho (L) and Manuel Pellegrini could be competing for the same players next season. Old guard: John Terry (top), Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole (R) are some of Chelsea's hew homegrown stars. Chelsea are also keeping abreast of the homegrown market. Manager Jose Mourinho could name only a 22-man squad in September after reaching his full quota of 17 overseas players. At the time, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Ryan Bertrand were the only homegrown players at his disposal — meaning he had to forego three squad places. Chelsea, like City, will be in the market for all the best English talent this summer, including Shaw and Barkley. And that means only one thing: sky-high prices. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about Manchester City, a football club, looking to buy British players in the summer.

Add p to both sides of the equation: 11*p + 24 + p = -p + p Combining like terms, we get: 12*p + 24 = 0 2. Next, we want to get rid of the constant term (24) on the left side of the equation, to have only the term with the variable p on the left side. To do this, subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: 12*p + 24 - 24 = 0 - 24 Simplifying, we get: 12*p = -24 3. Now, we want to isolate p on the left side. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p (which is 12): 12*p / 12 = -24 / 12 Cancelling the common terms, we get: p = -2 So, the value of p that solves the equation 11*p + 24 = -p is p = -2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Yes The Anglo-Irish War (also known as the Irish War of Independence) indeed ended in 1921 with a stalemate, leading to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State. This conflict took place from January 21, 1919, until July 11, 1921, between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the British security forces in Ireland. The IRA was a military organization advocating for an independent Irish Republic, free from British rule. The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed on December 6, 1921, by representatives of the British government and Irish delegates, including Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith, sought to establish peace in a politically divided Ireland. The terms of the treaty recognized the Irish Free State as a self-governing Dominion within the British Empire, similar to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Irish Free State was granted effective internal independence while remaining constitutionally linked to the British Crown. The signing of this treaty resulted in the partition of Ireland into two separate entities. The 26 southern counties formed the Irish Free State, while the remaining six northeastern counties (an area known as Northern Ireland) chose to remain part of the United Kingdom, reflecting the predominantly unionist, Protestant majority in this region that favored continued British rule. Although the agreement ended the conflict and marked a significant step in the Irish struggle for independence, it also generated intense disagreement and division among the Irish population. Opponents of the treaty argued that they could not accept any compromise short of creating a fully independent, united Ireland. This opposition eventually led to the Irish Civil War (1922-1923) between pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions, causing further strife and hostility in the country. To sum up, your given statement is a good and accurate answer to the question, as it highlights the key aspects of the end of the Anglo-Irish War. This includes the stalemate, the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and the establishment of the Irish Free State as a Dominion within the British Empire, with an internal autonomy yet constitutionally linked to the British Crown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Select from: -Trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with sugar and place them in a preheated oven on a baking sheet. -Trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with oil and place them in a preheated oven on a baking sheet.","completion":"The second option, trim the ends, rinse in cold water, cut sprouts in half, toss with oil and place them in a preheated oven on a baking sheet, makes more sense to accomplish the goal of cooking brussels sprouts. This method ensures that the sprouts are prepared and cooked properly, resulting in a delicious and healthy dish. Here's a more detailed explanation of the process: 1. Preparation: - Begin by selecting fresh Brussels sprouts with a bright green color and firm texture. Avoid any that have yellowing leaves or soft spots. - Rinse the sprouts under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. - Trim the ends of the Brussels sprouts by cutting off about 1/4 inch of the stem. This helps them cook evenly and removes any tough parts. - Peel off any loose, discolored, or damaged outer leaves. These are typically not very appetizing and may not cook properly. - Cut the sprouts in half lengthwise; this allows them to cook more quickly and evenly, and also maximizes their surface area for caramelization. 2. Toss with oil and seasoning: - Place the halved Brussels sprouts in a mixing bowl. - Drizzle with olive oil, approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons, depending on the quantity of Brussels sprouts. This will help them cook evenly and develop a delicious, crispy texture. - Season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also add additional seasoning options like garlic powder, onion powder, or crushed red pepper flakes for more flavor variety. - Toss everything together until the sprouts are well coated in oil and seasonings. 3. Cooking: - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature will cook the sprouts quickly, preserving their nutrients and creating a crispy exterior. - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil to make clean-up easier. - Arrange the Brussels sprouts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, ensuring each piece has plenty of space. Crowding them may lead to uneven cooking and prevent caramelization. - Roast in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the sprouts are tender and have developed a golden brown color on the outside. You can flip the sprouts halfway through cooking to ensure even browning on both sides. 4. Serving and additional options: - Once the roasted Brussels sprouts are out of the oven, you can serve them as a delicious side dish or add them to salads. - For additional flavor, consider adding balsamic glaze, grated Parmesan cheese, or toasted pine nuts before serving. This method is preferred over the first option, which involves tossing the Brussels sprouts with sugar. While sugar can sometimes be used to help the caramelization process, it is uncommon to use it with Brussels sprouts and may result in a final dish that is overly sweet and potentially less healthy. Tossing the sprouts with oil is a more traditional and sensible method, giving the finished dish a crispy exterior and well-cooked interior."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: A local district attorney says that the probe into Sandra Bland's death after a traffic stop is being treated \\"like a murder investigation,\\" despite preliminary information indicating that she committed suicide. Bland was arrested July 10 after a traffic stop and died three days later in her cell, sparking questions about the manner of her death and outrage. An autopsy found that she died by asphyxiation and that she used a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell. \\"This is being treated like a murder investigation,\\" Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday evening. \\"I want fingerprints run. I want...DNA tests run on the trash bag.\\" He also called for \\"any other valid scientific testing that we have so we can say with certainty what happened in her cell.\\" \\"There are too many questions that still need to be resolved,\\" Mathis added. The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and is being supervised by the FBI, Mathis said. But local church pastors say they and Bland’s relatives believe the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice. Her relatives have called for an independent autopsy to be completed as well, with the results expected by Tuesday. The DA's statement about the case came as Capt. Brian Cantrell, of the Waller County Sheriff's Office, gave a more detailed account of what happened after Bland's arrest as their department released three hours of footage from inside the jail. Cantrell said that Bland was taken to Waller County Jail after refusing medical attention on the scene after a confrontation with police. There, she was placed in a cell alone because she was deemed a \\"high risk\\" inmate to the safety of others based on the nature of the charge against her, Cantrell said. On the morning of Monday, July 13, jailers checked on Bland and she said she was \\"fine,\\" according to Cantrell. The jailer also said that she could use a phone that was located in the cell using a PIN number. There were no records of a call being made, Cantrell said. Just before 9 a.m., when jailers returned to see if she wanted to go to the recreation hall, they found her hanging from the privacy portion of her cell. According to Cantrell, they then put her on the ground to administer CPR. Preliminary information from the medical examiner's office indicated that she died from self-inflicted asphyxiation, Cantrell said. \\"The death of Miss Bland was a tragic incident, not one of... criminal intent,\\" Cantrell told reporters. He also expressed the department's \\"sincere condolences\\" for the death. In the wake of the incident, all trash bag liners were removed from the cells at the jail. No jailers have been disciplined as of yet. Dash cam footage of the traffic stop may be released Tuesday, Cantrell said. Mathis said that Bland appeared to be \\"very combative\\" during the traffic stop. \\"It was not a model traffic stop and it was not a model person that was stopped,\\" Mathis told reporters, referring to whether or not Bland was compliant. He noted that the dash cam footage may not clarify what happened because much of the activity takes place in Bland's car, of which there was a limited view. Supporters of Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested July 10 and found dead in her cell three days later, said today they have already seen the dash-cam video that they say shows an officer dragging Bland out of her car and chastising her for smoking in her vehicle. \\"She has the right to smoke in her car. That is her right,\\" the Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant of Baltimore, who has been working to raise awareness of the case, said at a news conference in Texas this morning. Mathis said that the assertion that Bland was pulled out of her car window was untrue. Byrant said “there are many questions that must be answered.” “We are not satisfied with the explanation that she committed suicide,” he said. “We are in a state of emergency here in Texas. We are not afraid of ISIS, we're afraid of the police.” ||||| Authorities in Texas have released a video covering the three hours before Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell. NBC Chicago's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015) Texas authorities on Monday released a three-hour video taken from outside a jail cell where an Illinois woman arrested during a traffic stop was found dead. The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest. Video Footage Shows Hours Leading Up to Illinois Woman's Jail Cell Death The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest. NBC Chicago's Regina Waldroup reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015) Authorities also said dashcam video of Bland's arrest is expected to be released Tuesday. Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday the video is consistent with information the officer has provided about the traffic stop. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said Bland was arrested after she allegedly kicked an officer. But Mathis cautioned that the dashcam video shows only restricted views of the stop in Prairie View, Texas. The Chicago-area black woman's death at the Waller County jail in Hempstead, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers. The FBI and the Texas Rangers are investigating. \\"This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,\\" Mathis said. Bland's death been ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, a finding that supporters and relatives dispute. Bland's family and others have called for a Justice Department probe and an independent autopsy. \\"This was not a case of suicide, but homicide,\\" Rev. Jamal Bryant, of the Empowerment Temple AME Church of Baltimore, said earlier Monday. He said he was in Hempstead at the Bland family's request. DPS has said the trooper who stopped Bland violated traffic stop procedures and the department's courtesy policy, but hasn't elaborated further. The trooper is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Bland may have been trying to text or email in the moments after she was pulled over for an improper lane change, Mathis said Monday. \\"Sandra Bland was very combative,\\" the district attorney said. \\"It was not a model traffic stop ... and it was not a model person that was stopped on a traffic stop. I think the public can make its own determinations as to the behaviors that are seen in the video.\\" The video from the jail released Monday shows no activity in the hallway leading to Bland's cell for about 90 minutes until an officer goes to check on her. It shows a deputy reacting to what she sees while looking in the cell, triggering a frenzy of activity involving other deputies. An EMT crew arrives with a wheeled stretcher. The video does not show the inside of her cell or even her cell door. Deputies and medical personnel are seen coming and going, but a body isn't visible. Capt. Brian Cantrell, head of the sheriff's department criminal investigation division, said the video was motion sensitive, indicating if nothing is taking place after a certain amount of time, it turns off. He said the FBI has been given hard drives to determine if there's been any manipulation. Cantrell said a guard checked with Bland about two hours before she was found dead and Bland told her, \\"I'm fine.\\" About an hour later, she asked to make a telephone call from her cell and was advised the phone was on a wall in the cell, according to Cantrell. There is no record of her ever making a phone call, he said. Mathis also said jail records show Bland was offered a medical checkup but declined. Cantrell declined to describe Bland's death in detail. He described the plastic garbage bag used as a ligature by extending his hands about 5 to 6 feet apart. The bags, he said, had been approved by a jail inspector, but have since been removed from all cells. Relatives and friends have insisted she was upbeat and looking forward to a new job at Prairie View A&M University, the school where she graduated in 2009. She was in the area to interview for the job and accepted it. Mathis also said the dashcam video doesn't provide a complete view. The trooper's dash cam shows a view forward toward Bland's car, but not inside and not to the side, where she wound up on the ground after authorities said she kicked the officer. \\"It doesn't show how she got on the ground,\\" Cantrell said. Copyright Associated Press / NBC Chicago ||||| HEMPSTEAD, Tex. — The authorities on Monday offered new details of the final hours of the life of a Chicago-area woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas three days after she was arrested during a traffic stop. A Waller County sheriff’s official described a timeline for the jail cell of the woman, Sandra Bland, that started early in the morning of July 13, when she refused a breakfast tray around 6:30 a.m., until a jailer found her hanging shortly after 9 a.m. For about 90 minutes during that period, there was no movement by jail officials in the hallway leading to her cell, according to a video that the authorities released from a camera inside the jail. “This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,” the Waller County district attorney, Elton Mathis, said. He said the case is likely to be turned over to a grand jury expected to be impaneled in August. Mr. Mathis said he expected investigators to release a dashboard camera video of Ms. Bland’s arrest on Tuesday. “There are too many questions that need to be resolved,” Mr. Mathis told reporters, saying that the Bland family “does make valid points” that Ms. Bland seemed to “have a lot of things going on in her life for good.” Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff’s Office said that Ms. Bland replied “I’m fine” when a jailer was conducting rounds shortly after 7 a.m. and later inquired about how to make a phone call. But shortly after 9 a.m., a female jailer saw Ms. Bland hanging in her cell and summoned help. Other officers and emergency medical personnel tried unsuccessfully to administer CPR. The death of Ms. Bland has set off protests and calls for a federal investigation from her relatives and supporters, who have sharply disputed the official ruling by the Harris County medical examiner that her death was a suicide. They said Ms. Bland, who was black, was a vocal opponent of police brutality, and they have requested an independent autopsy. United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, on Monday urged the Justice Department to investigate the death. Photo “Someone’s child died; some young woman died that this family loves, and we owe them an explanation,” Ms. Jackson Lee said in asking Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to begin an inquiry. “I cannot sense under the facts that I know now that a 28-year-old young woman, excited about a new job, posed a threat to anybody in Waller County, including any law enforcement officer.” The Texas Department of Public Safety has said the Texas Rangers and the F.B.I. are also investigating the case. Hempstead, the county seat of Waller County, is about 60 miles northwest of Houston. Ms. Bland had come to the county from her home in Naperville, Ill., for a job at Prairie View A&M; University. Ms. Bland was arrested on July 10 in Waller County by an officer with the Department of Public Safety on a charge of assaulting a public servant. She had been pulled over for failing to signal a lane change. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story A lawyer for the family, Cannon Lambert, told NBC News that the dashcam video showed that the encounter between Ms. Bland and the state trooper became confrontational after she refused the officer’s demand to put out a cigarette. The authorities said she hanged herself with a plastic bag, resulting in death by self-inflicted asphyxiation. A handful of supporters of Ms. Bland gathered Monday in sweltering midday heat outside the Waller County Sheriff’s Office, which holds the jail cell where she died, continuing a vigil that began last week. Brandi Holmes of Houston held a sign reading, “What happened to Sandy Bland?” Another sign read, “State police profiling — you stopped her for what.” The Rev. David Madison, president of the A.M.E. Ministers Alliance in Houston, said the demonstrators were united behind the calls for a Justice Department investigation. “We’re not accepting the report of death suicide,” said the minister, who is pastor of the Greater Ward A.M.E. Church in Houston. “Sandra Bland had just moved from Chicago to Houston to start a new job. You don’t come all the way to Houston just to kill yourself.” The death has fueled additional tensions over the treatment of African-Americans in police custody and comes roughly three months after the death of Freddie Gray, 25, an unarmed African-American in Baltimore who died from injuries sustained while being transported in a police van. Photo Ms. Jackson Lee was among a bipartisan group of Houston-area officials who were in Hempstead over the week to express concern about the case and meet with members of Ms. Bland’s family. The group included Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican; State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat; and State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist, was arrested after a traffic stop on July 10 and died three days later in her cell, raising questions about the manner of her death. Waller County District Attorney, Elton Mathis, has said that the investigation into Bland's death is being treated \\"like a murder investigation,\\" despite preliminary information suggesting she may have committed suicide. An autopsy found that Bland died by asphyxiation, using a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell. The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and supervised by the FBI; however, local church pastors and Bland's relatives believe that the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice.

His Sudanese father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. As an adult, Samir is first seen operating as an arms dealer. While negotiating a deal with Omar in Yemen he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends, and when Omar's people arrange an escape, they take Samir with them. They meet Fareed, a lieutenant in the al-Nathir terrorist organization. FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton suspects Samir has been radicalized and begins tracking him. Joining al-Nathir, Samir uses the skills he learned as a Special Forces Engineer Sergeant with the U.S. Army Special Forces to bomb the U.S. consulate in Nice, France. It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for a US intelligence contractor, Carter; Samir is devastated when he learns that despite Carter's covert efforts, innocent people perished in the consulate bombing. Impressed with Samir, Fareed introduces him to leader Nathir, who discloses a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during Thanksgiving and instructs Samir to act as liaison to each of the al-Nathir sleeper bombers. Later, Carter unwittingly interrupts a meeting between Samir and Omar, and is killed by Omar. Samir reveals his deep cover to Agent Clayton, who tracks him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. While on board a cargo ship to Marseille, France, Samir kills Nathir and Fareed, and tells an enraged Omar that by targeting innocents they betrayed Islam.

In 1951, with secret means of communications established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. In January 1953, Speer began work on his draft memoirs, and over the next year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for the things he did right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.In the mid-1950s, Wolters quarrelled with Kempf who effectively dropped out of the network for a number of years, adding to the burden on Wolters and Riesser. While Speer's pleas for his former associate and his former secretary to work together eventually brought about a healing of the breach, this was to some degree superficial as Kempf was aware that Wolters, even then, disagreed with Speer's opinions. Wolters questioned Speer's readiness to accept responsibility for the Nazi regime's excesses and did not believe Speer had anything to apologise for, though the strength of his feelings on this point was kept from Speer—but not from Kempf and Riesser.Wolters was tireless in his efforts on behalf of Speer and his family to such an extent that his son, Fritz, later expressed feelings of neglect.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: What is probably true about Puskas?

Q: Generate an appropriate title for the given text. The generated title must be short and include the main topic of the text. The preferred titles are under fifteen words. By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York When the pandemic hit the US in March, Sarah Sherman, owner of Hopper Real Estate in Eastham - a holiday home rental business on the Cape - saw her summer season erased with cancellations. But by mid-July, her business had revived - despite the number of cases in the country setting records. At one point, she scored more than 16 bookings in just two days - a number unheard of in a typical year. \\"It's definitely feeling like summer,\\" she says. The return of visitors was a major relief to Ms Sherman and business owners like her across Cape Cod, a peninsula that juts off Massachusetts into the Atlantic Ocean that was made famous as the summer playground of the Kennedys. Cold and grey in the winter, it is dependent economically on the summer months, when its population doubles and families from across the northeast pour in to sunbathe, cycle and gorge on lobster and fried clams. As the country went into lockdown, reservations \\"just stopped\\", she recalls. \\"We were like, 'Oh my god, what is going to happen?'\\" \\"We didn't know whether there was going to be a summer.\\" That worst case scenario didn't materialise. Families with second homes de-camped for extended stays earlier in the year than usual. Renters soon followed, as a long spring in lockdown created pent-up demand, particularly for places like the Cape, to which most visitors travel by car. By the 4 July holiday weekend - typically one of the busiest in the year - occupancy rates at hotels were above 90%. But as case counts rise elsewhere in the country, Ms Sherman says it is too early to say if the area's economy has escaped. \\"As we watch the rest of the country spike, we're like, 'If that happens here, that could close down the rest of our summer really quickly.'\\" Consumer spending stalls Ms Sherman's concerns are widely shared. Economists have warned that consumer spending in the US appears to be stalling, even in places, like Massachusetts, which have so far escaped a sharp rise in cases. Spending has flattened across the country since the 4 July holiday, and remains down more than 6% since January, according to data from a team of researchers at Harvard University, who found the pullback has been driven by wealthy families and led to significant job loss at businesses in neighbourhoods that cater to such a clientele. For a place like the Cape, which relies on tourist dollars, the economic impact is likely to be significant, says Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Wealthy families are more likely to have been spared job and income cuts, which could help spending bounce back when people feel safe again. But it's not clear how many businesses will be able to survive until then, she says. \\"We're just beginning to see the longer term harm to the economy,\\" she says. 'Not as busy' Many restaurants and other stores are offering off 20% or more, as visitors shop and dine out less. At Scargo Cafe in Dennis, takeaway and outdoor tables have helped to maintain business, but with a nearby cinema and theatre closed, co-owner David Troutman says it's nothing like a typical summer, when people pack three deep at the bar and wait for an hour to be seated. Many of his 73 staff are working part-time and he didn't hire extra seasonal help. \\"Whether it's a good economy or bad economy or the pandemic, [second-home owners] going to come down here no matter what,\\" he says. \\"But people are unquestionably afraid to come into the building .... It's certainly not as busy.\\" The subdued tone is especially evident in Provincetown, a small town on the tip of the Cape whose art galleries and restaurants are typically jammed with visitors. Mike Carroll, owner of the Schoolhouse Gallery, says he has reduced public hours and cut back his staff from three to one, opting to handle most things himself. \\"It's really good to have a to-do list every day because the news is not good,\\" he says. \\"Our visitor population will be down, business will definitely be down and the seasonal aspect of it will definitely make it more acute.\\" New economy? That's what longtime Cape Cod vacationer Zoe Fishman fears. Though her family has retreated to its second home on the Cape almost every weekend since March - much earlier than usual - activities have been largely limited to beach-going and pool-time at the grandparents'. And she knows that will take a toll. \\"There are definitely major changes to how we spend,\\" says the paediatrician, who described her economic outlook as \\"dismal\\". \\"I hope that next summer will be a summer of a lot of new restaurants. I hope that we'll see a new sort of economy,\\" she says. \\"But I think what we're probably going to see next summer is a lot of empty places.\\" A:","completion":"Cape Cod Tourism Amid Pandemic Uncertainty"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Possible answers: 1. The leaves don't have to be excessively long; you could simply cut them. You will also want to beware of weed whaling. 2. You can use a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) sprig, or just a combination of cuttings. Cutting from a real fica plant usually doesn't require you to cut it whole, but some varieties of artificial ficus do. 3. You don't want the sprig to be a brand new shoot, but it also shouldn't be too old either. Look for a sprig with no damage and healthy, green leaves. 4. The main benefit to a cutting is that it won't rip or damage its leaves. Mature sweet ficus varieties have a long stem and the stem should be somewhat inward.Choose from options above and answer: What most naturally follows? How to grow a ficus benjamina Select a healthy sprig for cutting. The easiest way to grow a new ficus is with a cutting from an established plant. The best cutting will be a small sprig that's at least 6 inches (15 cm) long, and with a few leaves on it. Answer:","completion":"Growing a ficus benjamina, also known as a weeping fig or simply ficus, is a rewarding experience due to its lush foliage and easy adaptability to various indoor conditions. Following the selection of a suitable sprig, certain steps need to be taken to ensure the successful growth and propagation of the cutting. Here are the subsequent steps: 1. Prepare the cutting: Once you have selected a healthy sprig, carefully remove it from the parent plant using a clean, sharp pair of pruning shears or a knife. Make a diagonal cut at the base of the stem to maximize the surface area for rooting. Remove any leaves from the lower half of the cutting to prevent them from touching the soil or water when planted, as this may cause rot. 2. Rooting the cutting: There are two methods for rooting ficus benjamina cuttings - in water or in a potting mix. a. Water rooting: Place the cut end of the stem in a container filled with clean water. Ensure that no leaves are submerged in the water. Place the container in a warm and brightly lit spot, avoiding direct sunlight. Change the water every few days to prevent bacterial growth. Roots should begin to appear within 2 to 4 weeks. b. Soil rooting: Dip the cut end of the stem in a rooting hormone, which can be found at a local nursery or garden center, to encourage root growth. Plant the cutting in a moist, well-draining potting mix, such as a mixture of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Rooting in soil generally takes longer than water rooting but may result in a stronger root system. 3. Provide a nurturing environment: Regardless of the rooting method, ensure that the cutting is placed in a warm environment with consistent temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C). Additionally, provide bright, indirect light to support growth, and avoid placing the cutting in areas with drafts or temperature fluctuations. 4. Transplant to a pot: Once the cutting has established roots, carefully transplant it into a pot containing well-draining, high-quality potting mix. Choose a pot that is only slightly larger than the root ball, as ficus plants prefer snug pot conditions. Ensure that there are drainage holes in the pot to prevent waterlogged soil. 5. Care and maintenance: Ficus benjamina requires consistent, moderate watering, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out before watering it thoroughly. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so always check the soil moisture levels before watering. Fertilize the plant with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer). With attentive care and following these steps, your ficus benjamina cutting will grow into a thriving, attractive houseplant that will enhance your living space with its verdant foliage."},{"prompt":"Information: - Wrestling Society X (WSX) was a short-lived professional wrestling-based television series produced in 2006 by Big Vision Entertainment.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Soviet Occupation Zone (\\"Sovetskaya okkupatsionnaya zona Germanii\\", \\"Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany\\") was the area of central Germany occupied by the Soviet Union from 1945 on, at the end of World War II. On 7 October 1949 the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which became commonly referred to as East Germany, was established in the Soviet Occupation Zone. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The OderNeisse line is the international border between Germany and Poland. It was drawn at the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of the Second World War and is primarily delineated along the Oder and Lusatian Neisse rivers in Central Europe, meeting the Baltic Sea to the north, just west of the Polish seaports of Szczecin and winoujcie (German: \\"Stettin\\" and \\"Swinemünde\\"). All prewar German territory east of the line and within the 1937 German boundaries (23.8% of the former Weimar Republic) were placed under International Law Administrative status, with most of it being made part of newly-Communist Poland. The small remainder, consisting of the territory surrounding the German city of Königsberg (now renamed Kaliningrad, in honour of Soviet head of state Mikhail Kalinin) in northern East Prussia, was allocated to the Soviet Union (as Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR, today the Russian Federation) after the war (pending the final World War II peace treaty for Germany). The vast majority of the native German population in these territories fled, or was killed or expelled by force. The OderNeisse line marked the border between the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and Poland from 1950 to 1990. East Germany confirmed the border with Poland in 1950, while West Germany, after a period of refusal, finally accepted the border (with reservations) in 1970. In 1990 the newly reunified Germany and the Republic of Poland signed a treaty recognizing it as their border. - West Berlin was a city that existed in the period between the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990 as a political enclave surrounded by East Berlin and East Germany. It was east of the Inner German border and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945 and shared economic, political, legal, and sporting systems with West Germany, but was not \\"de jure\\" part of it. It had a special and unique legal status because its administration was formally conducted by the Western Allies. East Berlin, \\"de jure\\" occupied and administered by the Soviet Union, was the \\"de facto\\" capital of East Germany. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, physically divided East and West Berlin until it fell in 1989. - North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK ), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang is both the nation's capital as well as its largest city.

Continue writing the following text. The child took to playing music on the guitar instantly but ignored the game because the","completion":"fascination with the guitar was far greater than any digital entertainment could offer. The child, named Alex, had always shown an interest in music from a young age, attracted to the melodic tunes and the rhythmic vibrations that emanated from various musical instruments. As Alex plucked the strings of the guitar, the sounds produced transported him into a world, so real and yet surreal, that he couldn't help but explore it further. Intrigued by this newfound passion, he was drawn towards the rich history of the guitar and its diverse use across different genres of music, from classical to rock, folk to modern pop. Alex's parents, witnessing this zealous interest in music, decided to encourage his talent by enrolling him in guitar lessons with a local tutor. The tutor, Mr. Hudson, was an accomplished musician who had a wealth of experience and knowledge about various musical instruments, especially the guitar. He was mesmerized by Alex's raw talent and helped him hone his skills, teaching him the intricacies of the renowned instrument. While embracing the journey of learning the guitar, the nuances of the strings and chords gradually unfolded to Alex. As he progressed, the agility of his fingers improved remarkably, creating harmonious melodies that left listeners spellbound. Not only did his technical prowess on the guitar develop, but his understanding of musical theory, composition, and songwriting grew exponentially as well. The passion for music built within him generated a sense of commitment that led to hours of practice each day, pushing his boundaries and testing the limits of his abilities. Playing and exploring various musical styles, from blues to jazz and beyond, Alex quickly became multifaceted in his guitar playing. One day, during a local open-mic event, Alex stepped onto the stage for the first time, with nerves tingling and heart pounding, taking his guitar as his only companion. As the crowd hushed, he began to play, transporting everyone to the magical and enchanting world he had discovered within the confines of his room. His performance, imbued with raw emotion and sheer talent, earned thunderous applause, affirming his potential as a musician. That moment marked the beginning of a journey that transformed Alex from a passionate hobbyist into a dedicated musician, no longer just dabbling in the world of music but now committing himself wholeheartedly. Collaborating with fellow musicians and forming a band, Alex continued to perform at various venues, garnering a loyal fan base that reveled in the soulful melodies he and his bandmates created. Over the years, the band experimented with different styles and sounds, creating a unique blend of music that resonated with their growing audience. As their popularity surged, they began receiving invitations to perform at music festivals across the country, gaining recognition within the industry. This newfound attention opened doors to record deals, allowing the band to release music that reached a wider audience and solidified their place in the music world. Despite the success and the life-altering journey, Alex never lost touch with the love for music that had initially drawn him to the guitar. He continued to approach his craft with the same passion and dedication, constantly pushing himself to learn and evolve as a musician. The simple act of picking up the guitar had unexpectedly led him down a path he never would have imagined, and yet, it had shaped his life in ways he could never have dreamed of. The game, a mere distraction when compared to the magical allure of the guitar, had remained untouched, as if it knew that it could never match the wonders that a gloriously-plucked melody could bring. The once modest ambition of just playing for fun had been replaced with the pursuit of a lifetime - an everlasting journey of passionate music creation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: It was the third time that the Portuguese government had requested external financial aid from the IMF—the first occasion occurred in the late 1970s following the Carnation's Revolution. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"A: Yes, the answer provides insight into the number of times Portugal has requested external financial support, which is three times. Portugal requested assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the first time in the late 1970s after the Carnation Revolution, and the answer specifies that the most recent occasion was the third time the country sought help. To add further details, Portugal has experienced three significant instances when it required external financial support: 1. Late 1970s: After the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, Portugal faced ongoing economic turmoil, which led to the first request for external assistance from the IMF in 1977. The country received loans amounting to 830 million, subsequently participating in several economic adjustment programs to improve its financial situation. 2. Late 1980s: The second instance occurred in the late 1980s when Portugal faced a balance of payment crisis and increasing deficits. The government again requested financial aid from the IMF, receiving the assistance in 1983, primarily due to its financial struggles and economic challenges. 3. Eurozone Crisis in 2011: The third and most recent request for external financial support came during the 2010-2011 European debt crisis. Like many European countries, Portugal experienced difficulties as the sovereign debt crisis grew. In April 2011, Portugal requested financial assistance from the European Union (EU) and the IMF. This resulted in a bailout package totaling €78 billion, comprising €52 billion from the EU and €26 billion from the IMF. Portugal subsequently underwent a strict austerity program to recover from its financial troubles. These three instances demonstrate the various times Portugal has reached out for external financial support to stabilize its economy and address critical financial challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Emile Durkheim. According to the context provided, Durkheim's work on totemic rituals marked the initial efforts to study rituals. His work was later extended by Erving Goffman, and subsequently utilized by Randall Collins, who formulated the interaction ritual theory. Durkheim was a pioneering sociologist whose studies form the foundation of the sociology of religion, focusing on the social influence on individual practices and beliefs including the study of rituals. However, it was Goffman and Collins who extended and applied this work specifically to everyday focused encounters and the concept of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Goffman discussed everyday routines and ordinary social interactions, shedding light on the importance of these common rituals in societal context, whereas Collins built on this to specifically examine the relationship between interaction, emotional energy, and collective effervescence generated during group gatherings. So, in the historical chronology of the study of rituals captured in this passage, Durkheim was indeed the first."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\"?

During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

The Olympics, as a global sporting phenomenon, has always commanded significant attention and viewership, with millions of spectators attending the event in person and billions more tuning in to watch it online or on television. It is an international gathering where athletes from all around the world come together to compete in various sports, fostering unity and camaraderie among nations. In the given description, the term \\"massive crowd\\" alludes to a large number of people who have gathered at the running event. The fact that the event is being shot from far away to encompass the entire crowd indicates that the gathering of spectators is not just big, but potentially enormous. While it is difficult to quantify the exact number of people present in the crowd, it would be logical to infer that the gathering is indeed \\"huge\\" based on the context provided. This could be further substantiated by considering factors such as the popularity and universal appeal of the Olympics and the historic trend of drawing massive crowds to its events.

Step 3: Consider the available choices Choice A focuses on Maria, who dislikes soda, not buying any when it was on sale. This choice could make sense if Maria was generally the one in charge of grocery shopping, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the addiction element with Victoria. Choice B, on the other hand, concerns Victoria - who is addicted to soda - not buying any when it was on sale. This choice may seem counterintuitive, given Victoria's addiction.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: tilt up from bay to close up with moving traffic and pedestrians .","completion":"The most important words in the sentence \\"tilt up from bay to close up with moving traffic and pedestrians\\" are: 1. Tilt up: These words describe the action that needs to be performed. \\"Tilt up\\" refers to a specific type of camera movement in which the camera angle is adjusted in an upward direction, capturing a vertical view of the scene. This action is commonly used in photography and videography to create a unique and artistic perspective, transition between scenes, or reveal aspects of the environment. 2. Bay: \\"Bay\\" describes the location from which the camera will perform the tilting action. A bay typically refers to a body of water partially enclosed by land, often with a wide opening to the sea or ocean. By mentioning \\"bay,\\" the sentence implies that the camera angle initially captures a view of the bay area, and then transitions to the close up of moving traffic and pedestrians. 3. Close up: Located after the tilting action, \\"close up\\" refers to the intended shot of the camera, presumably focusing on the more intricate details of the scene. A close-up shot is used in photography or film to emphasize specific elements, such as facial expressions, objects, or actions. In this sentence, \\"close up\\" suggests that the emphasis will shift from the bay to nearby moving traffic and pedestrians. 4. Moving traffic: \\"Moving traffic\\" indicates the subject matter to be captured within the close-up shot after the tilting action. This phrase implies that there is ongoing activity involving vehicles on streets or roads. By emphasizing the movement, the sentence suggests that dynamic aspects of the scene, such as the motion of cars, buses, or motorcycles, will be focused on in this visual portrayal. 5. Pedestrians: \\"Pedestrians\\" are also part of the close-up shot following the tilt-up action. These are people walking along streets, sidewalks, or other public spaces, co-existing with moving traffic. Including pedestrians in this sentence highlights the human aspect of the scene and adds a sense of everyday life and activity to the visual. In summary, the most important words in the sentence are \\"tilt up,\\" \\"bay,\\" \\"close up,\\" \\"moving traffic,\\" and \\"pedestrians,\\" as they respectively describe the core action, initial setting, intended focus, and primary subjects of the scene."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.

At the White House on Wednesday, Trump continued to speak cautiously about the coming summit, even while praising the North Korean leader for the prisoner release. “Everything can be scuttled,” Trump told reporters. “A lot of things can happen — a lot of good things can happen, [and] a lot of bad things can happen.” North Korea on Wednesday granted amnesty to three Americans of Korean descent. They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus. Pyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year. A White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea’s latest prisoner release as a “positive gesture of goodwill” ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month. South Korea’s presidential office said Pyongyang’s decision was a “very positive” sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting. The freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North. “I don’t know the answer to that,” Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. “It would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ... I’m glad that we don’t have to confront that.” It’s not clear what, if anything, the U.S. gave up in exchange for the prisoners. It’s not even clear a concession was needed, since North Korea has for decades sought the presumed legitimacy provided by a summit with a sitting U.S. president. after the story ends does Pyongyang take more prisoners? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Probably Pyongyang only takes 1 or 2 more prisoners - Probably Pyongyang stops taking prisoners - Probably Pyongyang continues to take many prisoners - not enough information Answer:","completion":"- not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We should have arrived at Liverpool at 9:19, but due to a typical London fog, the train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30 that it got there. In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \\"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road. By now it was far too late even to try to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30, so we decided to return to Cambridge. It took seven long hours instead of the usual two to make that journey. Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train. Tired and hungry we finally reached home at ten, opening the door to the sound of the telephone bell.

This might have been helpful in 1971, when it was originally written, but you simply can't use hardly any of the stuff Hoffman writes about. Truly a disappointment. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product, \\"Steal this Book\\" by Abbie Hoffman, in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses disappointment and a sense of depression after the initial novelty of owning the book wore off. The main criticism stems from the belief that the content is outdated and not applicable to today's context. The reviewer begins by using a somewhat sarcastic tone when mentioning that the book is \\"Carried by wannabe-Anarchists everywhere.\\" This statement implies that the individuals who carry this book around may be trying to project an image of rebellion or activism, but they may not be genuinely invested in the ideologies that the book promotes. The primary disappointment expressed in the review is that the content of the book is outdated. The reviewer acknowledges that \\"Steal this Book\\" might have been helpful when it was first published in 1971, but it is not practical or useful in the present day. However, it is important to note that this criticism is based on the reviewer's opinion, and others may have different perspectives on the book's relevance in modern times. Moreover, the reviewer's dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the fact that they cannot use \\"hardly any of the stuff\\" written about in the book. This further emphasizes that the book does not meet their expectations, and consequently, they consider it a disappointment. In summary, the review portrays \\"Steal this Book\\" in an unflattering light due to the belief that the content is outdated and not applicable in today's society. The reviewer also seems to imply that owning the book may be more about projecting an image rather than the act of genuinely embracing the ideas it presents.

I loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack... It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. If we lived in Elizabethan days, I'd say this movie's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy. But since we don't, let's say it's more like a Drama-Suspense movie. The plot is simple, but the story is complex. The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. Much of the story is shown rather than told, which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling. I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case I do. (Though I did enjoy the book too.) I've bought the DVD, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary. (I also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after I saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him.

Bolivia, officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia (), is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range. The largest city and principal economic and financial center is Santa Cruz de la Sierra, located on the Llanos Orientales (Tropical lowlands) mostly flat region in the East of Bolivia. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is geographically the largest landlocked country in the Americas, but remains a relatively small country in economic and military terms. Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish \\"conquistadors\\" arriving from Cuzco and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century. During the Spanish colonial period Bolivia was administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. Spain built its empire in great part upon the silver that was extracted from Bolivia's mines. After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for Simón Bolívar, on 6 August 1825. Since independence, Bolivia has endured periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various peripheral territories to its neighbors, such as Acre and parts of the Gran Chaco. It has been landlocked since the annexation of its Pacific coast territory by Chile following the War of the Pacific (1879–84), but agreements with neighboring countries have granted it indirect access to the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

Context: Coming off their easy home win over the Bears, the Vikings flew to the desert for a Week 13 Sunday Night duel with the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took the lead at halftime when Warner completed a 34-yard TD pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. In the third quarter, Arizona increased their lead when kicker Neil Rackers kicked field goals of 31 and 30 yards. In the fourth quarter, Arizona kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 29-yard field goal. However, the Vikings tried to rally with Favre hooking up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 31-yard TD pass. The Vikings tried an onside kick, which they did not recover and Arizona ran out the clock to seal their win. With only their second loss of the season, the Vikings not only fell to 10-2, but they lost starting linebacker E. J. Henderson to a season-ending broken leg. Question: How many yards was the differential between the longest touchdown and the longest field goal? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to find the longest touchdown and the longest field goal in the game and then subtract the length of the longest field goal from the longest touchdown. Longest touchdown: Kurt Warner's 39-yard TD pass to Anquan Boldin. Longest field goal: Ryan Longwell's 25-yard field goal. Now, we subtract the two numbers: 39 (longest touchdown) - 25 (longest field goal) = 14 yards So, the difference between the longest touchdown and the longest field goal is 14 yards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Einstein's brain had extraordinary folding patterns in several regions, which may help explain his genius, newly uncovered photographs suggest. The photographs, published Nov. 16 in the journal Brain, reveal that the brilliant physicist had extra folding in his brain's gray matter, the site of conscious thinking. In particular, the frontal lobes, regions tied to abstract thought and planning, had unusually elaborate folding, analysis suggests. \\"It's a really sophisticated part of the human brain,\\" said Dean Falk, study co-author and an anthropologist at Florida State University, referring to gray matter. \\"And [Einstein's] is extraordinary.\\" Snapshots of a genius Albert Einstein was the most famous physicist of the 20th century; his groundbreaking theory of general relativity explained how light curves due to the warping of space-time. When the scientist died in 1955 at age 76, Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who autopsied him, took out Einstein's brain and kept it. Harvey sliced hundreds of thin sections of brain tissue to place on microscope slides and also snapped 14 photos of the brain from several angles. Harvey presented some of the slides, but kept the photos secret in order to write a book about the physicist's brain. The pathologist died before finishing his book, however, and the photos remained hidden for decades. But in 2010, after striking up a friendship with one of the new study's co-authors, Harvey's family donated the photos to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Falk's team began analyzing the photos in 2011. [See Photos of Einstein's Brain] More brainy connections The team found that, overall, Eintsein's brain had much more complicated folding across the cerebral cortex, which is the gray matter on the surface of the brain responsible for conscious thought. In general, thicker gray matter is tied to higher IQs. Many scientists believe that more folds can create extra surface area for mental processing, allowing more connections between brain cells, Falk said. With more connections between distant parts of the brain, one would be able to make, in a sense, mental leaps, drawing upon these faraway brain cells to solve some cognitive problem. The prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in abstract thought, making predictions and planning, also had an unusually elaborate folding pattern in Einstein's brain. That may have helped the physicist develop the theory of relativity. \\"He did thought experiments where he'd imagine himself riding alongside a beam of light, and this is exactly the part of the brain one would expect to be very active\\" in such thought experiments, Falk told LiveScience. In addition, Einstein's occipital lobes, which perform visual processing, showed extra folds and creases. The right and left parietal lobes also looked very asymmetrical, Falk said. It's not clear how those features contributed to Einstein's genius, but that brain region is key for spatial tasks and mathematical reasoning, Falk said. The jury is still out on whether Einstein's brain was extraordinary from birth or whether years of pondering physics made it special. Falk believes both played a role. \\"It was both nature and nurture,\\" she said. \\"He was born with a very good brain, and he had the kinds of experiences that allowed him to develop the potential he had.\\" But most of Einstein's raw ability probably came from a trick of nature rather than a lifetime of hard work, said Sandra Witelson, a researcher at McMaster University who has done past studies of Einstein's brain. In 1999, her work revealed that Einstein's right parietal lobe had an extra fold, something that was either hardwired into his genes or happened while Einstein was still in the womb. \\"It's not just that it's bigger or smaller, it's that the actual pattern is different,\\" Witselson said. \\"His anatomy is unique compared to every other photograph or drawing of a human brain that has ever been recorded.\\" Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience.

(AP) — For much of the past three decades, pit bulls have been widely regarded as America's most dangerous dog — the favorite breed of thugs, drug dealers and dog-fighting rings, with a fearsome reputation for unprovoked, sometimes deadly attacks. Hostility toward \\"pits\\" grew so intense that some cities began treating them as the canine equivalent of assault rifles and prohibited residents from owning them. But attitudes have softened considerably since then as animal activists and even television shows cast the dogs in a more positive light. The image makeover has prompted many states to pass new laws that forbid communities from banning specific breeds. And it illustrates the power and persistence of dog-advocacy groups that have worked to fend off pit bull restrictions with much the same zeal as gun-rights groups have defeated gun-control measures. \\"Lawmakers are realizing that targeting dogs based on their breed or what they look like is not a solution to dealing with dangerous dogs,\\" said Lisa Peterson, a spokeswoman for the American Kennel Club. Seventeen states now have laws that prohibit communities from adopting breed-specific bans. Lawmakers in six more states are considering similar measures, and some cities are reviewing local policies that classify pit bulls as dangerous animals. Pit bull advocates hail the changes as recognition that breed-specific laws discriminate against dogs that are not inherently aggressive or dangerous unless they are made to be that way by irresponsible owners. The dogs' foes complain that their message is being drowned out by a well-funded, well-organized lobbying effort in state capitols. The debate puts millions of pit bull owners up against a relatively small number of people who have been victimized by the dogs. Ron Hicks, who sponsored a bill in the Missouri House to forbid breed-specific legislation, said he was surprised when nobody spoke against his proposal last month at a committee hearing. \\"I figured a few parents would be there who would bring tears to my eyes,\\" the Republican said. \\"Would it have changed my opinion or what I believe in? No.\\" A version of Hicks' legislation was endorsed by a House committee last month and needs to clear another committee before a full House vote. The state Senate is considering a comparable bill, as are lawmakers in Utah, South Dakota, Washington, Vermont and Maryland. In Kansas, the communities of Bonner Springs and Garden City repealed their pit-bull bans earlier this year. Summer Freeman did not know there was a ban when she moved to Bonner Springs last year after a divorce. She panicked when an animal-control officer discovered her pet and told her she had 15 days to get rid of the dog named Titan or move out of town. \\"I think of him like my son,\\" she said. \\"He's my dog-son, I guess you could say. He's at my hip all the time. He's just a big baby that wouldn't hurt a fly.\\" Freeman was forced to leave Titan at a shelter in Lawrence for nine months until she successfully fought to overturn the law in January. For dog owners and pit bull opponents alike, the battle is as deeply personal as any gun-control or religious issue. Each side accuses the other of lying, exploiting emotions and using bullying tactics. Pit bull owners insist their dogs are harmless, loving family members that shouldn't be blamed for something they didn't do. To opponents, they are a volatile breed whose genetics drive them to kill more than two dozen people in the U.S. each year, many of them young children. Popular television shows such as \\"Pit Boss\\" and \\"Pit Bulls and Parolees\\" on Animal Planet glorify the animals and minimize the tragedies that occur when pit bulls turn on humans, pit bull opponents say. \\"Everything is telling us these animals are safe if you raise them right,\\" said Jeff Borchardt, an East Troy, Wis., man whose 14-month-old son was mauled to death a year ago by two pit bulls that tore the child from the arms of their owner, who was baby-sitting. \\"My son's dead because of a lie, because of a myth. My life will never be the same.\\" The two dogs that killed Borchardt's son had lived with their owner since soon after they were born, were well-cared for and had no history of aggressive behavior, he said. Both had been spayed or neutered. That contradicts the contention that only mistreated, neglected or abused pit bulls attack people. Colleen Lynn, founder of DogsBite.org, pointed to a friend-of-the-court brief her organization submitted in a 2012 case in which the Maryland Court of Appeals declared pit bulls \\"inherently dangerous.\\" \\"Appellate courts agree with us. Doctors and surgeons agree with us. That is credibility right there,\\" Lynn said. \\"We also have the support of three divisions of the U.S. military, huge, massive bodies in the U.S. government.\\" The Marines, Army and Air Force all have banned dangerous dogs — including pit bulls and rottweilers — from their bases because of the \\"unreasonable risk\\" they pose to safety, Lynn said. On the other side stand the American Bar Association and National Animal Control Association, which oppose breed-specific laws because they are discriminatory against a type of dog that isn't really a single breed. Three main breeds — Staffordshire bull terrier, American pit bull terrier and American Staffordshire terrier — along with mixes of those breeds are generally considered pit bulls. But many muscular, square-jawed, boxer-type dogs often are misidentified as pit bulls, making breed-specific bans hard to enforce. And because fatal pit bull attacks are a rarity compared with other causes of death such as auto accidents, dog advocates argue that breed-specific bans amount to legislative overkill. \\"All communities deserve comprehensive dog laws that demand responsible dog ownership and that hold reckless owners accountable when their poor decisions wind up getting other dogs or other people hurt,\\" said Ledy Vankavage, a top lobbyist for the Best Friends Animal Society. Don Bauermeister, assistant city attorney for Council Bluffs, Iowa, led the effort to pass a local pit bull ban that took effect in 2005. He recalled first reading about the issue in the July 27, 1987, issue of Sports Illustrated, which carried a full-cover shot of an angry pit bull baring its teeth. Across the top, it said \\"BEWARE OF THIS DOG.\\" After the Council Bluffs ban went into place, the number of pit bull attacks that resulted in hospitalization plummeted from 29 in 2004 to zero the past few years — proof, Bauermeister said, that breed-specific bans work. The opposition to pit bull bans, he added, is a sign that many American pet owners have lost touch with reality. \\"Fifty years ago, you could take a sick animal behind a barn and put it out of its misery,\\" he said. \\"That's just the way it was done. Now they would investigate you for doing that. The emotional irrationality of Americans and their dogs has never been worse than it is today.\\" ||||| 1. WHAT IS BREED-SPECIFIC LEGISLATION? 2. WHAT BREEDS OF DOGS HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY BSL? 3. WHAT POSITION DO LEGAL, ANIMAL-RELATED, AND NON-ANIMAL RELATED ORGANIZATIONS TAKE ON BSL? 4. AREN'T CERTAIN BREEDS OF DOGS MORE LIKELY TO INJURE OR BITE THAN OTHERS? 5. DOES BSL REDUCE DOG BITES? 6. HOW COSTLY IS IT TO IMPLEMENT AND ENFORCE BSL? 7. WHAT IS THE TREND IN BSL? 8. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE DOG BITE-RELATED INCIDENTS IN A COMMUNITY? Q: What is breed-specific legislation? A: Breed-specific legislation (BSL), also referred to as breed-discriminatory legislation (BDL), is a law or ordinance that prohibits or restricts the keeping of dogs of specific breeds, dogs presumed to be specific breeds, mixes of specific breeds, and/or dogs presumed to be mixes of one or more of those breeds. The most drastic form of BSL is a complete ban; but BSL also includes any laws or governmental regulations that impose separate requirements or limitations, including but not limited to: mandatory spay-neuter, mandatory muzzling, liability insurance requirements, special licensing and additional fees, mandatory microchipping or tattoos, owner / walker age requirements, property posting requirements, confinement and leash requirements, breed-specific pet limits, sale or transfer notification requirements, restrictions on access to certain public spaces with the dog [e.g.: public parks, school grounds], required town-issued items [e.g.: fluorescent collar; vest], training requirements, requirement that photos of the dog and/or owner be kept on town file. BSL, in all of its forms, results in the destruction of many pet dogs. Q: What breeds of dogs have been targeted by BSL? A: Various breeds have been or currently are targeted by BSL. Until the law was repealed in 2009, Italy regulated the keeping of 17 breeds. In the United States, jurisdictions have either banned or put discriminatory restrictions on one or all of the following: Akita, “Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldogs”, Alaskan Malamute, “American Bandogge”, American Bulldog, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Belgian Malinois, Bullmastiff, Bull Terrier, Cane Corso, Chihuahua, Chow Chow, Dalmatian, Doberman Pinscher, Dogo Argentino, “Fila Brasileiro”, German Shepherd Dog, Miniature Bull Terrier, Neapolitan Mastiff, \\"Pit bull\\" (please note that \\"pit bull\\" is not a breed of dog), Perro de Presa Canario, Rottweiler, Shar Pei, Siberian Husky, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, “Tosa Inu”, and wolf-hybrids. These ordinances also target dogs suspected of being mixes of one or more of the named breeds. Q: What position do legal, animal-related, and non-animal related organizations take on BSL? A: All of the following organizations do not endorse BSL: American Animal Hospital Association, American Bar Association, American Dog Owner's Association, American Humane Association, American Kennel Club, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, Association of Pet Dog Trainers, Australian Veterinary Association, Best Friends Animal Society, British Veterinary Association, Canadian Kennel Club, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Federation of Veterinarians in Europe, Humane Society of the United States, International Association of Canine Professionals, National Animal Control Association, National Animal Interest Alliance, National Association of Obedience Instructors, Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (UK & Australia), United Kennel Club, and the White House Administration. In addition, many state and local-level veterinary medical associations and humane organizations oppose BSL. Q: Aren't certain breeds of dogs more likely to injure or bite than others? A: There is no evidence from the controlled study of dog bites that one kind of dog is more likely to bite a human being than another kind of dog. A recent AVMA survey covering 40 years and two continents concluded that no group of dogs should be considered disproportionately dangerous.[1] Additionally, in a recent multifactorial study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association on the exceptionally rare events of dog bite-related fatalities, the researchers identified a striking co-occurrence of multiple, controllable factors in these cases.[2] Breed was not identified as a factor. Q: Does BSL reduce dog bites? A: No. BSL has not succeeded in reducing dog bite-related injuries wherever in the world it has been enacted. • An analysis published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association explains one reason that BSL could not be expected to work even if particular breeds could be identified as high risk. The authors calculated the absurdly large numbers of dogs of targeted breeds who would have to be completely removed from a community in order to prevent even one serious dog bite-related injury. For example, in order to prevent a single hospitalization resulting from a dog bite, the authors calculate that a city or town would have to remove more than 100,000 dogs of a targeted group. To prevent a second hospitalization, double that number. [3] • Denver, CO enacted a breed-specific ban in 1989. Citizens of Denver continue to suffer a higher rate of hospitalization from dog bite-related injuries after the ban, than the citizens of breed-neutral Colorado counties. [4] A study published in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior , compared medically treated dog bites in Aragon, Spain for 5 years prior to and following enactment of Spain’s “Law on the legal treatment of the possession of dangerous animals” (sometimes referred to Spain’s Dangerous Animal Act) (2000). The results showed no significant effect in dog bite incidences when comparing before and after enactment of the BSL. [5] • The Netherlands repealed a 15-year-old breed ban in 2008 after commissioning a study of its effectiveness. The study revealed that BSL was not a successful dog-bite mitigation strategy because it had not resulted in a decrease in dog bites. [6] • The Province of Ontario in Canada enacted a breed ban in 2005. In 2010, based on a survey of municipalities across the Province, the Toronto Humane Society reported that, despite five years of BSL and the destruction of \\"countless\\" dogs, there had been no significant decrease in the number of dog bites. [7] ||||| In the 13-year period of 2005 through 2017, canines killed 433 Americans. Pit bulls contributed to 66% (284) of these deaths. Combined, pit bulls and rottweilers contributed to 76% of the total recorded deaths. | More » ||||| Why Breed-Specific Legislation Doesn’t Work Targeting types or breeds of dogs won't stop dog bites or protect people The HSUS opposes laws and ordinances aimed at forbidding or regulating dog ownership based solely on breed or type of dog. Breed-specific legislation (BSL) does not enhance public safety or reduce dog bite incidents. Rather, such laws, regulations, and ordinances are costly to enforce and harm families, dogs, and communities. The HSUS supports finding real and effective strategies for safe, humane community dog management and believes BSL is a distraction from that goal—it wastes valuable resources and charges a moral cost in the process. Missing the scope of the problem Most breed-specific laws are created as a misguided response to a dog bite incident or attack. There are a number of reasons BSL does not protect citizens from dog bites, including: There is no credible evidence to demonstrate that any particular breed or type is overrepresented among biting dogs. Professional animal expert organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, have found that no breed is more dangerous than another. to demonstrate that any particular breed or type is overrepresented among biting dogs. Professional animal expert organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, have found that no breed is more dangerous than another. Identifying breeds is often subjective and unreliable . For example, the term “pit bull” usually encompasses three separate breeds, along with any mixes of those breeds. Any medium-sized dog with short hair and a squarish muzzle could meet most people’s visual perception of a “pit bull” dog—including hound mixes, retriever mixes, and other dogs with no “pit bull” ancestry. Clearly, the larger the dog, the greater the potential damage if he or she bites, but no one breed or type is more genetically programmed to bite than others. .

It often ends up being created as a reactionary measure to a bite incident that ignores the true scope of the problem. As a result, there’s no scientific data that proves breed-specific measures have ever been effective at eliminating dog bites. Underfunded animal-control agencies bear the brunt of the burden, as BSL creates unrealistic mandates that take dogs out of homes and into shelters. These shelters then must endure the burden of housing—and often euthanizing—family dogs who posed no bite risk. Understanding the real risk factors Though breed or type don't affect a dog’s behavior, there are a variety of other factors and influences that do, including: The dog’s hormones .

No two dogs will ever react exactly the same way to a given circumstance. The person’s ability to recognize warning signs. Dogs who bite usually give some kind of warning, whether subtle or overt. If people ignore or misunderstand such warnings, dogs may feel the need or urge to bite. Developing a proactive solution Our society coexists with almost 80 million dogs—living in 40% of American households—so it’s vital that communities have preventative, effective dog-bite solutions that are backed by stakeholders and lawmakers. Such solutions involve understanding the real risk factors for bites, helping minimize those risk factors, and ensuring that bites are handled effectively and uniformly to eliminate future risk. Dog bite incidents will decline when all dog owners are given access to critical services such as veterinary care, spaying and neutering resources, training and behavior assistance, and other socialization and health information. Proactive strategies aimed at preventing bites from happening in the first place—paired with appropriate enforcement-based responses to bite incidents—create a safer, more humane approach to managing dogs in communities. ||||| Official The White House Response to Ban and outlaw Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) in the United States of America on a Federal level! Breed-Specific Legislation Is a Bad Idea Thanks for your petition. We don't support breed-specific legislation -- research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources. In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at twenty years of data about dog bites and human fatalities in the United States. They found that fatal attacks represent a very small proportion of dog bite injuries to people and that it's virtually impossible to calculate bite rates for specific breeds. The CDC also noted that the types of people who look to exploit dogs aren't deterred by breed regulations -- when their communities establish a ban, these people just seek out new, unregulated breeds. And the simple fact is that dogs of any breed can become dangerous when they're intentionally or unintentionally raised to be aggressive. For all those reasons, the CDC officially recommends against breed-specific legislation -- which they call inappropriate. You can read more from them here. As an alternative to breed-specific policies, the CDC recommends a community-based approach to prevent dog bites. And ultimately, we think that's a much more promising way to build stronger communities of pets and pet owners. Tell us what you think about this response and We the People. ||||| Janelle Holland rescued her pit bull Triumph (she calls him \\"T-Diddy\\") nine years ago. He was found at age 2 and had been used as a fighting dog before Janelle got him. Janelle says the dog is great with people and very friendly. (Photo: Steve Hebert for USA TODAY) Three decades after officials in more than 700 cities throughout the country began passing bans and other restrictions to keep pit bulls out of their communities, state and local governments are increasingly reconsidering their approach to what not so long ago was America's most vilified pet. Since June, at least nine communities in the Midwest have overturned pit bull bans that were on the books. Last week, Hallsville, Mo., became the latest to lift its ban after a family successfully appealed to the City Council for a change in law when it learned the family dog was a pit bull mix. Over the past two years, more than 100 municipalities across the USA have overturned bans and other restrictions that target dogs in the pit bull family, the generic term commonly used to describe the American pit bull terrier, Staffordshire bull terrier and many mixed-breed dogs with square-shaped heads and bulky builds. More communities could soon follow suit. The unified government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan., is considering lifting a pit bull ban that has been on the books for nearly a quarter-century, as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its animal control policies. The push in Kansas City (pop. 148,000) comes as Roeland Park, Kan. (pop. 6,800) recently began reviewing its ban on pit bulls. The nearby community of Bonner Springs announced this year that it was lifting its ban. Advocates argue the bans have been ineffective in reducing dog bites and led to millions of dogs being euthanized. They say too often animal control officials, law enforcement and the media misidentify offending dogs as pit bulls. \\"The only ones that are being affected by these bans are responsible dog owners,\\" said Janelle Holland, a pit bull owner who was forced to leave Roeland Park more than a decade ago after learning she was violating the ban. There's been action on the statewide level as well. This year, South Dakota and Utah joined 17 other states in passing laws to prevent local governments passing \\"breed-specific legislation,\\" or BSL, making it illegal for cities to pass bans targeting pit bulls or any other breed. (The South Dakota law went into effect in July, and Utah's prohibition on pit bull bans will be law on New Year's Day.) Breed-specific legislation began spreading in communities throughout the country in the mid-1980s after a surge in fatal dog bitings, including a disproportionate number of incidents initially attributed to pit bull-type dogs. The pit bull was popular in illegal dogfighting rings, and the breed developed a reputation as a favorite accessory of drug dealers and gangsters. This month, residents in the Denver suburb of Aurora, Colo., voted by a 2-to-1 ratio in a referendum to keep their pit bull ban on the books. The Aurora vote follows a vote in 2012 in Miami-Dade County, where voters opted to keep the ban by a similarly wide ratio. Fourteen-month-old Daxton Borchardt was fatally mauled last year by two pit bulls. (Photo: Jeff Borchardt) Jeff Borchardt, an East Troy, Wis.-man whose 14-month-old son, Daxton, was fatally mauled last year by two pit bulls while being cared for by a babysitter, says government leaders should look to the Aurora and Miami examples before overturning bans. \\"There's this pro-pit-bull movement that tries to paint these dogs as nanny dogs and sweet, lovely and kind,\\" Borchardt said. \\"It's disgusting, it's dangerous, and it's irresponsible.\\" Some groups, including the American Veterinary Medical Association, the Humane Society and the American Bar Association, have suggested governments would be better off focusing attention on problem animals in a community rather than banning any particular breed of dog. The push to end pit bull bans got a boost last year, when the Obama administration — in response to opponents of such laws petitioning the White House — said it was opposed to breed-specific legislation. Stakeholders on opposite sides of the issue cast aspersions about the evidence the others use to back their arguments. A lack of recent government or third-party data on pit bull bites further muddies the national conversation. The National Canine Research Council, which opposes breed-specific legislation, points to a 2013 study it partly funded that suggests a dog's environment has more to do than its breed with the likelihood of a dog making a deadly attack. The study, published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, of 256 dog bite-related fatalities from 2000-2009 found co-occurring factors in more than 80% of the deadly incidents, such as the absence of an able-bodied person to stop the attack, a history of abuse or neglect of the dog and the failure by owners to neuter the dogs. \\"It's becoming more and more obvious that breed-specific legislation doesn't improve public safety,\\" says Janis Bradley, director of communication for the NCRC. \\"Its purpose is to reduce injuries from dog bites, but there is no municipality or state where it's enacted where they've been able to show that it's accomplished this.\\" The Center for Disease Control, which opposes BSL, notes that fatal attacks represent a tiny fraction of about 4.7 million dog bites Americans suffer annually and that it's difficult to accurately calculate bite rates for specific breeds. DogsBite.org, a group that advocates in favor of BSL, points to its own research, culled from news reports of dog-bite-related fatalities, that shows 74% of incidents from 2005 to 2013 involved a pit bull or Rottweiler. Colleen Lynn, founder of DogsBite.org, dismisses the suggestion from the CDC and others that BSL doesn't work. \\"It's not designed to reduce all dog bites,\\" said Lynn, who said pit bulls are an inherently aggressive animal. \\"It's breed-specific and meant to reduce pit bull maulings and fatalities.\\" Even as dozens of American communities abandon BSL, some ponder its merits. This year, Riverside, Ala., a community about 40 miles outside of Birmingham, weighed enacting a pit bull ban after a 5-year-old boy was fatally mauled by neighbor's pit bull. City officials opted against it. Mayor Rusty Jessup said he would prefer not to have any pit bulls in his community of 3,000. Jessup said he didn't think his community could enforce such a ban or even positively determine the breeds of dogs. \\"We were just afraid that we were going to get situations where we're trying to enforce this and people are saying, 'That dog's not a pit bull, it's a boxer,'\\" Jessup said. \\" And doggone it, who are we going to have to make that determination?\\" Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1uHILDO ||||| AURORA | By a 2-to-1 margin, Aurora voters say they don’t want pit bulls to return to the city, based on early returns. With more than 70,000 votes counted across Adams and Arapahoe counties so far, voters have overwhelmingly said no to Aurora ballot question 2D, which would lift the city’s 9-year-old ban on the dogs. In Arapahoe County, 68 percent of voters said no. In Adams County, 63 percent voted against lifting the ban. The issue has been extremely contentious for years in Aurora, but especially since the city council pitched the question to voters. The issue has drawn national attention, from both critics and proponents of the ban. Colleen Lynn, a supporter of breed bans and founder of the group dogsbite.org, said she was happy with the outcome in Aurora, but a bit surprised by the margin of victory for the ban. “I didn’t expect it to be this big,” she said. Lynn said that while pit bull supporters are often very public and vocal in their support for the breed, there are many people who oppose the breed but don’t want to speak publicly about it. “We believe that the majority of Americans do not want to live next door to a pit bull period. And that is usually a very silent majority,” she said. Lynn said that’s why her group supports ballot measures like Aurora, because they give people a chance to privately voice their concerns about the animals. Under the city’s current rules, three breeds of dogs commonly recognized as pit bulls — American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers and Staffordshire bull terriers — are banned within the city limits. When city council first enacted the ban in 2005, there were 10 breeds barred from the city, but council in 2011 softened the ban to just three breeds and gave owners a chance to have their dog DNA-tested to prove whether they were in fact a banned breed. Dogs who were already in the city at the time of the ban were allowed to stay if their owners paid a registration fee and followed certain restrictions. According to the city’s numbers, about 90 registered pit bulls remain in the city, down from about 500 when the ban took effect. The city has euthanized more than 1,100 restricted-breed dogs since the ban. Opponents of the ban have argued that the law should focus on irresponsible dog owners as opposed to specific breeds. But supporters of banning the dogs, which include the city’s Animal Care Division, have said pit bulls are more dangerous than other breeds and should be barred from Aurora. Plus, opponents say, because Denver and other cities have similar bans, Aurora would become a dumping ground for dogs barred from other cities. ||||| Breed-specific legislation (BSL) targets specific breeds of dogs that are wrongly thought to all be dangerous – most frequently \\"pit bull types\\" – and places stricter regulations on these dogs or even makes ownership of them illegal. Several cities, towns and states across the United States and Canada have adopted breed-specific measures in an attempt to prevent dog bites in their communities. However, while BSL may look good on the surface, it is not a reliable or effective solution for dog bite prevention. The AVMA is opposed to breed-specific legislation. Any dog can bite According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 4.5 million people in the United States are bitten by dogs each year, and more than 800,000 receive medical attention for dog bites, with at least half of them being children. It is no exaggeration to say that dog bites pose a significant health risk to our communities and society. The issue of dangerous dogs, dog bites and public safety is a complex one. Any dog can bite, regardless of its breed. It is the dog's individual history, behavior, general size, number of dogs involved, and the vulnerability of the person bitten that determines the likelihood of biting and whether a dog will cause a serious bite injury. Breed-specific bans are a simplistic answer to a far more complex social problem, and they have the potential to divert attention and resources from more effective approaches. The problem with breed-specific legislation AVMA's Policy on Dangerous Animal Legislation states: \\"The AVMA supports dangerous animal legislation by state, county, or municipal governments provided that legislation does not refer to specific breeds or classes of animals. This legislation should be directed at fostering safety and protection of the general public from animals classified as dangerous.\\" There are several reasons why breed-specific bans and restrictions are not a responsible approach to dog bite prevention: Breed-specific laws can be difficult to enforce, especially when a dog's breed can't easily be determined or if it is of mixed breed. Frequently, breed-specific legislation focuses on dogs with a certain appearance or physical characteristics, instead of an actual breed. \\"Pit bulls\\" are the most frequent targets of breed-specific legislation despite being a general type rather than a breed; other breeds also are sometimes banned, including Rottweilers, Dobermans and boxers. However, it is extremely difficult to determine a dog's breed or breed mix simply by looking at it. A study conducted by Maddie's Fund, a national shelter initiative, showed that even people very familiar with dog breeds cannot reliably determine the primary breed of a mutt, and dogs often are incorrectly classified as \\"pit bulls\\". Because identification of a dog's breed with certainty is prohibitively difficult, breed-specific laws are inherently vague and very difficult to enforce. Breed-specific legislation is discriminatory against responsible owners and their dogs. By generalizing the behaviors of dogs that look a certain way, innocent dogs and pet owners suffer. BSL can lead to the euthanasia of innocent dogs that fit a certain \\"look,\\" and to responsible pet owners being forced to move or give up dogs that have never bitten or threatened to bite. Furthermore, dogs that are considered to be of a \\"dangerous breed\\" may already be serving the community in positions such as police work, military operations, rescue purposes, and as service animals. Contrary to being a liability, these animals are assets to society; however they, too, suffer due to misinformation and breed-based stereotypes. Breed bans do not address the social issue of irresponsible pet ownership. Dogs are more likely to become aggressive when they are unsupervised, unneutered, and not socially conditioned to live closely with people or other dogs. Banning a specific breed can give a community a false sense of security, and deemphasize to owners of other breeds the importance of appropriate socialization and training, which is a critical part of responsible pet ownership. In enacting breed-specific legislation, cities and states will spend money trying to enforce ineffective bans and restrictions rather than implementing proven solutions, such as licensing and leash laws, and responding proactively to owners of any dog that poses a risk to the community. It is not possible to calculate a bite rate for a breed or to compare rates between breeds because the data reported is often unreliable. This is because: The breed of a biting dog is often not known or is reported inaccurately. The actual number of bites that occur in a community is not known, especially if they don't result in serious injury. The number of dogs of a particular breed or combination of breeds in a community is not known because it is rare for all dogs in a community to be licensed. Statistics often do not consider multiple incidents caused by a single animal. Breed popularity changes over time, making comparison of breed-specific bite rates unreliable. However a review of the research that attempts to quantify the relation between breed and bite risk finds the connection to be weak or absent, while responsible ownership variables such as socialization, neutering and proper containment of dogs are much more strongly indicated as important risk factors. A better solution to dog bite prevention Animal control and legislative approaches to protecting a community from dangerous dogs should not be based on breed, but instead on promoting responsible pet ownership and developing methods to rapidly identify and respond to owners whose dogs present an actual risk. The AVMA recommends the following strategies for dog bite prevention: Enforcement of generic, non-breed-specific dangerous dog laws, with an emphasis on chronically irresponsible owners Enforcement of animal control ordinances such as leash laws, by trained animal care and control officers Prohibition of dog fighting Encouraging neutering for dogs not intended for breeding School-based and adult education programs that teach pet selection strategies, pet care and responsibility, and bite prevention AVMA's report A Community Approach to Dog Bite Prevention (PDF) highlights tangible steps that veterinarians can take alongside state and local leaders to implement effective dog bite prevention programs in their community.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways.

Bob Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' Interactive Video Mimics TV Surfing Rock icon Bob Dylan's 1965 hit \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" deemed one of the greatest songs ever by experts, just received the 2013 music video treatment. The interactive video, shared first with Mashable, is the song's first official video.

However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine. Question: \\"How many years elapsed between the settlements of the Portuguese and the British arrival in Hong Kong?\\" Response: \\"About 300 years\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

One day, Sean meets \\"Duke\\" Wayne (George Wendt), who introduces Sean to his boss, a shady developer named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray hires Sean as a spy, and orders him to follow Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), an accountant who has been investigating Ray's company. Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean 13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and beating him to death. When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It emerges that Matthews never had any intention of paying Sean for the killing, for he only wanted to use and eliminate him. But Sean survives from having a bullet put in his head then reveals that he had taken Gatley's work file of evidence and hidden it along with his documentation of events leading to the murder. When torture fails to make him disclose the whereabouts of the file, Sean is then brutally beaten about the head with golf clubs many times by Ray and his henchmen daily for weeks, in an effort to destroy his memory. After suffering a heavy amount of trauma, Sean escapes, killing Duke, and finds his way to a downtown homeless shelter where Gatley's widow, Susan (Kari Wuhrer), takes him under her wing, oblivious to his role in her personal tragedy. After she nurses him back to normal, he feels he has been reborn and they become lovers and he moves into her house. But after a few weeks, Susan finds his file describing the murder and, enraged, physically attacks him. Defending himself, Sean accidentally kills her.

Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier. Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the ObregÃ³n brothers. Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the ObregÃ³n cartel, who are arrested. Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the ObregÃ³n brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the JuÃ¡rez Cartel, the rival of the ObregÃ³n brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit. Javier's partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal. Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA. In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime. Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public, and he is arrested and is shown suffering probable torture in prison.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: There are many indicators of dilation that don’t require inserting your fingers into your vagina. This can be especially helpful if you are in a lot of pain or discomfort. Most women will make some type of sound when they’re in labor. Listening to what types of sounds you’re making can cue you into how much you’re cervix has dilated. The following sounds can accompany the various stages of labor and cervical dilation: At 0-4 centimeters dilated, you may not be making much noise and can talk through a contraction with little effort. At 4-5 centimeters, it may be difficult to nearly impossible to talk. Your noises may still be quiet. Between 5-7 centimeters, you may make louder and staccato noises. It should be nearly or completely impossible to talk through contractions. Between 7–10 centimeters (2.8–3.9 in), you may be making very loud noises and shouldn’t be able to talk through a contraction. If you’re a silent laborer, you can also check your dilation. Tell someone to ask you a question at the start of a contraction. The less you are able to say a sentence, the farther along your dilation is. Childbirth is an inherently emotional experience for the woman in labor. Watching what emotions you’re experiencing can cue you into how far your cervix is dilated. You may have the following emotions during labor: Happiness and laughter between 1-4 centimeters Smiley and laughing at little things between contractions between 4-6 centimeters Irritation at jokes and small talk around 7 centimeters until birth. Many people will notice certain scents when a woman gets to between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. The smell of labor is deep, heavy, and dusky—not musky. If you notice a distinct change to these scents in the smell of the room in which you’re laboring, your cervix may be between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. Some women may see a stringy mucus discharge at 39 weeks that is tinged pink or brown with blood. This bloody show may continue through the early stages of labor. At 6-8 centimeters dilated, however, a lot of blood and mucus may be present. Looking for these substances can indicate that you’re somewhere between 6-8 centimeters dilated. The purple line is located in your natal cleft, or what some people call the butt crack. This line can be a measure of how far you’re dilated, with it reaching the top of your cleft at full dilation. You may need someone to help you examine your purple line. Recognize that in the early stages of labor that the purple line will be closer to the anus. As your labor progresses, it will creep up between your buttocks. At full dilation, the purple line will extend to the top of your natal cleft. Many women experience physical signs of dilation that are visible without a vaginal examination. In general, many will feel like they have the flu as they get close to 10cm and/ or the pushing phase. Scanning your body for these signs and symptoms can help you figure out how much your cervix has dilated. In most, cases, a combination of these signs can indicate how you’re your cervix is dilated. Feeling like you have to vomit, having a flushed face and feeling warm to the touch can mean you’re about 5 centimeters dilated. You may also tremble uncontrollably. Vomiting alone may be the result of emotions, hormones, or fatigue. Seeing if your face is flushed with no other signs can be a good indicator that you’re 6-7 centimeters dilated. Be aware that trembling uncontrollably without any other signs can indicate fatigue or fever. See if you’re curling your toes or standing on your toes, which is a sign you’re between 6 and 8 centimeters dilated. Check your buttocks and upper thighs for goosebumps, which is a good sign that you’re at 9-10 centimeters. Recognize that having involuntary bowel movements is also a sign of full dilation. You may also see or feel the head at your perineum. As your baby descends into the birth canal, you will feel pressure at different points along your back. The more you dilate, the farther down your back the pressure will be lower. It will generally move from the rim of your pelvis down to your tailbone.","completion":"When a woman is having a baby, her body goes through changes called dilation. Dilation is how wide the cervix (the opening to the womb) becomes so the baby can come out. There are different ways to tell how much the cervix has dilated without looking inside the body. One way is by listening to the noises the woman makes when she is in labor. If she can talk easily during contractions, she may not be very dilated, but if she cannot talk and makes louder noises, she might be closer to giving birth. Another way is by observing her emotions and how she reacts to things. At first, she might be happy and laughing, but as she gets closer to giving birth, she may be more irritated and serious. During labor, some women might notice a change in their body scent, or see some blood and mucus. This can be a sign that they are getting closer to giving birth too. There is also something called the \\"purple line\\" at the back that moves up as the dilation increases. Some women might feel flu-like symptoms, feel really warm, or get goosebumps; these can also be signs of how much the cervix is dilated. Finally, as the baby moves down, the woman will feel pressure in her back which might help her know how close she is to giving birth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on their last three projects, these 10 stars are not. We used data gathered from our Celebrity 100 research and Box Office Mojo to calculate how much, on average, each star's last three films earned at the box office per dollar of pay. Think of it like a star return on investment number. ||||| Poor Eddie Murphy desperately needs a comeback. Remember back in the day when he was so funny on Saturday Night Live and in movies like Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop? His voice work has helped make movies like Shrek and Mulan tolerable for adults, and even his family-friendly movies, like Norbit and Dr. Dolittle, were good for some chuckles. But lately, Murphy's career has just collapsed. Imagine That, A Thousand Words and Meet Dave were colossal flops. Last year's Tower Heist, which was supposed to be something of a return to form for the comedian, failed to wow at the box office, earning 153 million on an estimated budget of 75 million. (In order to even come close to turning a profit, a movie has to earn twice its production budget in ticket sales, plus the millions spent on marketing.) Murphy then backed out of hosting the Oscars, which didn't help his reputation. His string of flops lands Murphy at the top of our Most Overpaid Actors list for 2012. We estimate that for every 1 Murphy was paid for his last three films, they returned an average of 2.30 at the box office. To compile our list, we used data on actors' earnings gathered for our Celebrity 100 list. Box office grosses and budget estimates are from Box Office Mojo. We looked at the last three films each actor starred in over the last three years that opened in more than 2,000 theaters, calculating the return on investment for the studios who pay his (or her) salary. Ranking second behind Murphy is a newcomer to our list: Katherine Heigl. For every dollar she was paid on her last three movies, they earned an average of 3.40. After hits like Knocked-Up, 27 Dresses and The Ugly Truth, Heigl's quote shot up to the 12 million range. Unfortunately, the films she's made at that price point have failed to deliver. Her most recent film, One For The Money, earned only 37 million on an estimated 40 million budget. Heigl needs to step away from the expensive star vehicles and rebuild her career. Her next release is the ensemble pic The Big Wedding, which hits theaters in April. Featuring Robert DeNiro, Susan Sarandon and Amanda Seyfried, the movie could give Heigl a chance to show how funny she can be when the pressure is off. In past versions of our overpaid actors roundup, we looked at each actor's films over the last five years. This year, we cut back to the last three years to give the list a more contemporary focus. That dropped Drew Barrymore from the top 10, but not because she has anchored any smashes lately. Barrymore was our worst-performing actor last year -- her films earned only 40 cents for each 1 she was paid. However she hasn't starred in three big releases over the last three years. We don't count ensemble films where there is no clear star like Barrymore's 2009 film He's Just Not That Into You, which was actually a hit. Reese Witherspoon ranks third on our list with an average 3.90 return for every 1 she was paid. Witherspoon is one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood, but her choices lately have been questionable, like 2010's How Do You Know. With a ridiculously high budget of 120 million -- a big chunk of which went to salaries for Witherspoon and big-name co-stars Paul Rudd, Jack Nicholson and Owen Wilson -- the romantic comedy never had a chance of turning a profit. It grossed just 49 million at the box office, making it one of the worst-performing films of 2010. Her most recent film, This Means War, didn't help much. The 65 million action comedy did OK, earning 157 million worldwide, but it wasn't enough to get Witherspoon off of our most overpaid list. Sandra Bullock makes a surprise entry in fourth place with a 5 return for every 1 she was paid. In 2009 Bullock starred in one of the biggest films of the year, The Blind Side. Not only did it earn 310 million at the box office globally, it was made for just 30 million, making it one of the most profitable films of the year. It was also a big earner for Bullock, who had a profit-sharing deal on the project. But her two other films of the last three years were stinkers: All About Steve and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close. [Bullock's representatives insist that Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close should not have been included in our calculations for the actress because she was not the star of the film. If you took that film out and added in The Proposal, her return on investment number would be much higher.] Rounding out the top five is Jack Black, whose films returned only 5.20 for every 1 he was paid. Last year's comedy The Big Year barely registered at the box office. Big-name stars like Black, Steve Martin and Owen Wilson couldn't overcome poor reviews and a less than sexy topic -- birdwatching. It earned only 7 million. Follow me on Twitter at DorothyatForbes.

Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\".

In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster? Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low. Hint: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs Answer:","completion":"The sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A, where the heat is set to high.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? best spent elsewhere","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"best spent elsewhere,\\" I will follow these steps: 1. Analyze the words and phrases in the sentence. 2. Assign sentiment values to the important words or phrases. 3. Determine the overall sentiment of the sentence based on the values assigned and any modifiers or contextual clues. Step 1: Analyze the words and phrases. In this sentence, the important words and phrases are \\"best\\" and \\"spent elsewhere.\\" Step 2: Assign sentiment values. The word \\"best\\" usually has a positive sentiment value, while the phrase \\"spent elsewhere\\" has a slightly negative connotation as it implies not spending time or money on the subject being discussed. Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment. Combining sentiment values: since the sentence suggests that the viewer's resources are \\"best spent elsewhere,\\" the overall sentiment leans negative. This is because the reviewer is implying that there are better options available, and the subject of the review (in this case, the movie) is not worth the time or effort.

If An elephant-ride, which allows you to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a cushioned howdah, is a great joy., can we conclude that \\"On top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the given statement, \\"An elephant-ride, which allows you to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a cushioned howdah, is a great joy,\\" we can conclude that \\"On top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider.\\" From the statement, it can be derived that the elephant-ride experience involves swinging through different terrains such as jungles and grasslands. The rider is described to be reclining on a cushioned howdah, which implies that the howdah is an integral part of the elephant-ride experience and serves as a comfortable seating arrangement for the rider. A howdah is a seat or carriage traditionally used on the back of an elephant as a form of transportation, used mostly in the past by the aristocracy or for hunting purposes. However, in this context, the howdah is being used for the purpose of swinging through the jungle and grassland landscape, providing an enjoyable experience to the rider. Moreover, the statement specifies that the howdah is cushioned, which suggests that it has been designed to provide additional comfort and support to the rider while they traverse the landscape. This further reinforces the idea that the elephant carries a cushioned howdah on its back for the rider's enjoyment and relaxation during the ride. In conclusion, based on the initial statement, it is reasonable to infer that on top of the elephants, there is a cushioned howdah for the rider that serves as a comfortable seat, enabling the rider to swing through the jungle and grassland while experiencing great joy. The howdah's presence fulfills the purpose of comfort and enhances the overall pleasure of the elephant-riding experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \\"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\\" Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God. To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.

Movie title: Latter Days Movie plot: Elder Aaron Davis (Steve Sandvoss), a young Mormon missionary from Pocatello, Idaho, is sent to Los Angeles with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith. They move into a bungalow apartment next to the apartment of openly gay party boy Christian Markelli (Wes Ramsey), an aspiring actor who works as a waiter at Lila's, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne (Jacqueline Bisset). Christian's best friend and roommate is Julie Taylor (Rebekah Johnson), who also works as a waitress and barmaid at Lila's Restaurant. His other co-workers include Traci Levine (Amber Benson), a young woman who struggles to get by while hoping to become a famous actress, and Andrew (Khary Payton), another aspiring young actor and openly gay party animal who has been HIV-positive since he was 15 because of his promiscuous lifestyle in junior high school, but still remains in good health.

The former are often too soft-toned to hold their own in a session (as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player's lap), whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear.

Question: \\"What is the major flaw of the witness system?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The major flaw of the witness system within the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, specifically regarding the \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, lies in its potential to conceal or inadequately address cases of sexual abuse. This rule stems from the interpretation of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which require sexual abuse allegations to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. Consequently, in cases where there is no corroboration, the Watch Tower Society instructs elders to \\"leave the matter in Jehovah's hands,\\" rather than pursuing further investigation or involving law enforcement. Critics argue that this policy, in effect, necessitates another witness to an act of molestation—an inherent impossibility. By relying on this rule, the organization may inadvertently protect the perpetrators of abuse rather than the victims. Former members, such as Barbara Anderson, claim that these policies contribute to concealing instances of sexual abuse and ultimately fail to protect the children within the organization. Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they prioritize the protection of children through education and by fostering a close-knit community. They argue that focusing on parental involvement and steering clear of activities that separate children from parents serves as the best means for ensuring child safety. Nonetheless, the \\"two witness rule\\" remains a contentious issue, as it may hinder the proper resolution of sexual abuse cases and potentially foster a culture of concealment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum, with the Forum to the northwest and the Baths of Caracalla to the south.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum, with the Forum to the northwest and the Baths of Caracalla to the south.\\", we can analyze the given information to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" Firstly, let's examine the information at hand about Classical Rome: 1. The nucleus of classical Rome is around the Colosseum. 2. The Forum is situated to the northwest of this nucleus. 3. The Baths of Caracalla are located to the south of this nucleus. Now, let's break down the hypothesis: \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" If the Forum is to the northwest of the nucleus of classical Rome (which is around the Colosseum), it indicates that the Colosseum is located to the southeast of the Forum. This assumption can be further analyzed with the available information: - Since the nucleus (Colosseum) is to the southeast of the Forum, it means that there's a diagonal relationship between the Colosseum and the Forum, with the Colosseum being located down and to the right from the Forum (when facing north). - Additionally, the Baths of Caracalla are stated to be to the south of the nucleus, which forms a triangular relationship between the three points of interest: The Forum, the Colosseum, and the Baths of Caracalla. Furthermore, to confirm the given hypothesis we can refer to the actual layout of the historic sites in Rome. Historical maps and current geographical data both support the premise and the hypothesis. The Colosseum (also known as the Flavian Amphitheater) is in fact situated to the southeast of the Roman Forum, which was the center of political, economic, and religious activities in ancient Rome. Moreover, the Baths of Caracalla, a large public bathing complex, can be found further south to the Colosseum, aligning with the given information. In conclusion, based on the premise and by analyzing the relative positions of the Colosseum, the Forum, and the Baths of Caracalla, we can assert that the hypothesis \\"The Colosseum is to the southeast of the Forum.\\" is indeed true.

Jackson is taken to a U.S. Air Force installation, and told the project is classified information by its commander Special Operations Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell). Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a \\"stargate\\" which uses constellations as spatial coordinates. On this revelation, Jackson is shown that the base has this Stargate, also discovered by Langford's father. They use Jackson's coordinates to align the Stargate's metal ring with markings along its outside, and once all seven are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O'Neil and other soldiers as they pass through the wormhole, though expresses concern at a nuclear bomb they brought as a last resort. On the arid desert planet, they find themselves in a pyramid-like structure. Jackson locates the Stargate and its controls, but lacks the coordinates to return home. O'Neil orders some men to stay behind to guard the Stargate. Nearby, they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral from the planet. Jackson is able to communicate with them as they speak a variation of Ancient Egyptian, and finds the tribe sees them as emissaries of their god Ra (Jaye Davidson).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: Does Kuwait support ISIS? Second question: Does Iran support ISIS? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"The two questions you asked: \\"Does Kuwait support ISIS?\\" and \\"Does Iran support ISIS?\\" are not asking the same thing, though they touch on a similar theme. They are seeking information about whether two distinct countries, Kuwait and Iran, support the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a violent extremist organization. Given that these are different nations with their own distinct political structures, histories, and geopolitical contexts, the implications and answers will not be the same. Now let's answer the questions: To clarify, the terrorist organization known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), also known as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and Levant) or Daesh, has been categorically denounced by most nations worldwide, including Middle Eastern countries like Kuwait and Iran. First question: \\"Does Kuwait support ISIS?\\" Kuwait, a small monarchy on the Persian Gulf, does not officially support ISIS. The Kuwaiti government and the vast majority of its citizens strongly condemn all forms of terrorism. In fact, Kuwait has suffered from terrorist attacks by extremists, including those linked to ISIS, such as a suicide bombing in 2015 at a mosque which killed 27 people. The government of Kuwait, in cooperation with international anti-terrorism efforts, has also initiated programs to counter extremist teaching and promote a moderate and inclusive version of Islam. However, it is worth noting that in the early years of the Syrian civil war, some private citizens and organizations in Kuwait were accused of financially supporting various Syrian rebel groups, which may have included extremist elements. This does not reflect official government policy and has largely stopped after the government tightened controls on money transfers. Second question: \\"Does Iran support ISIS?\\" Iran has been one of the most active countries in fighting against ISIS, given both its regional interests and its non-Sunni (Shia) majority, which ISIS considers heretical. It has provided significant support to various anti-ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. This includes backing Shia militias in Iraq, and the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which has been fighting ISIS as part of the broader Syrian civil war. Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has directly fought ISIS in both countries. So, while these two questions are asking about the relationship two different countries have with the same entity, ISIS, the answers and implications are unique to each country."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Seven U.S. sailors died in the collision between the Fitzgerald and a Philippine-flagged cargo ship 64 miles south of Yokosuka Naval Base. Cmdr. Bryce Benson, captain of the Navy ship, was injured in the collision when his cabin was crushed by the cargo ship's impact. He was rescued while hanging from the side of his ship, and was temporarily relieved of command Tuesday until he recovers from his unidentified injuries. The Fitzgerald arrived at the Yokosuka naval base within hours after the collision, with a 12-by-17-foot hole ripped in its starboard side below the waterline. The impact crushed the ship's superstructure, twisted its hull and ruined tens of millions of dollars of electrical equipment aboard, the U.S. Naval Institute reported Wednesday. Dry dock status, in which the ship is pulled completely from the water, will allow more complete evaluation of the extent of damage. The Navy will then determine if the ship should be repaired in Japan or in the United States. ||||| Story highlights The 10,000-ton USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal collided last month The Navy is carrying out an investigation into what happened Washington (CNN) The US Navy released new photos showing the damage caused to the USS Fitzgerald after it collided with a cargo ship on June 17, causing the death of seven US sailors.

Carl Schaffner is a crooked British (previously German) businessman who flees to Mexico after stealing company funds. While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.

That was the chief reaction to the double win Sunday night for the new Fox comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” a lightly watched show that managed to knock off two network titans, “The Big Bang Theory” and “Modern Family,” and much buzzed-about cable entries like HBO’s “Girls.” Kevin Reilly, the chairman of entertainment for Fox, admitted being surprised at the “Nine-Nine” wins for best comedy and best leading comedy actor (Andy Samberg.) “I’m harkening back to the year ‘The Shield’ won as best drama, which was the first time for a basic cable show,” Mr. Reilly said in an interview here on Monday. (That was 2002.) “Now it’s becoming almost expected,” he said, that cable shows always win the big awards. With “Nine-Nine’s” win, it’s “Like, ‘oh it’s a major upsetting win’ for a broadcast network,” he added. One explanation for the surprise win of “Nine-Nine,” some said on Monday, is that Globes voters often like to get out ahead of what they perceive might be the next hot show. “It feels like ‘The Office’ to me,” said Mr. Reilly, who was an ardent advocate of that comedy when he was at NBC and helped keep it alive until it emerged as a hit. “It has the same vibe.” (One of the “Nine-Nine” creators, Michael Schur, wrote and produced for “The Office” and had a guest role as Dwight’s Amish cousin, Mose.) The show’s other creator is Dan Goor, who spent about a decade as a late-night comedy writer, for Jon Stewart and Conan O’Brien. Mr. Schur and Mr. Goor were looking to build a workplace comedy with the kind of offbeat and diverse cast of characters that populate Mr. Schur’s other NBC comedy, “Parks and Recreation.” They chose to set it in a police station in Brooklyn. For “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” winning at the Globes comes just before the show will be given the klieg-light treatment as one of two Fox comedies to play after the Super Bowl on Feb. 2. (The other is “New Girl.”) “It is the perfect timing,” said Mr. Reilly, who acknowledged the timing might also be right to announce a second season of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine.” “But I was tempted to do it before the Globes,” he said. The only impediment, he noted, was business on other shows he needed to conclude first. “I don’t think that’s going to be a big announcement,” Mr. Reilly said. “I would anticipate the show will be back.” “Nine-Nine” is likely to draw new viewers, thanks to the wealth of attention from the Globes, which was watched by more than five times as many people as typically tune in to that sitcom. Thanks to some strong movies and the pairing again of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts, the broadcast of the Globes reached a 10-year high in audience figures, attracting just under 21 million viewers. It also scored well among those 18 to 49, the most important to advertisers. In that category, the show averaged a 6.5 rating, up 6 percent from last year.

Given those answer options, answer the question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province. Suddenly, the screen flashes to white as the men disappear in a fireball — the result of a bomb dropped from a U.S. MQ-9 \\"Reaper\\" drone. \\"Taliban fighters on the run following Afghan-led offensive in #Farah province, #Afghanistan. Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed. Less than 24 hours later, the U.S. Air Force posted its own Afghanistan-related tweet that raised eyebrows — this one referencing a viral audio clip that has sparked a lighthearted online debate among those who hear the word \\"Laurel\\" and others who hear \\"Yanny.\\" \\"The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,\\" read the Air Force tweet.

During the 1950s, Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen, nearly always against civilians, mainly from the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip, leading to several Israeli counter-raids. In 1956, Great Britain and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal, which the Egyptians had nationalized (see the Suez Crisis). The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israel's southern population, and recent Arab grave and threatening statements, prompted Israel to attack Egypt. Israel joined a secret alliance with Great Britain and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal[citation needed].

Answer:","completion":"Before selling land to settlers, the New Zealand Company, a private land investment company founded by Edward Gibbon Wakefield in the early 19th century, primarily purchased land from the indigenous Māori people of New Zealand. The New Zealand Company aimed to facilitate the systematic colonization of New Zealand by European settlers, by establishing settlements, organizing transportation, and promoting overseas immigration. Central to its plans was the acquisition of large tracts of land that would then be subdivided and sold to settlers at a profit, with the proceeds used to fund further settlement work. Initially, the Company attempted to negotiate land purchases directly with local Māori chiefs, employing agents to enter into agreements with local tribes. The Company believed that they could secure vast lands from the Māori people for relatively low prices, but relied heavily on the negotiation skills of their agents and the assumption that the Māori chiefs had a full understanding of the transactions. One of the most significant land purchases took place in 1839 when the Company agent, William Wakefield (the brother of the Company's founder), arrived in New Zealand and negotiated the purchase of approximately 20 million acres (around 8.1 million hectares) of land from the local Māori tribes. This acquisition became known as the \\"first and principal purchase\\" and encompassed large portions of present-day Wellington, Wanganui, and Taranaki. However, many of these land purchases were fraught with controversy and misunderstandings. The Māori people often had differing concepts of land ownership from the European settlers, and some believed they were only granting temporary rights to use the land, rather than transferring permanent ownership. These discrepancies led to numerous disputes and conflicts between Māori tribes and the New Zealand Company over the legitimacy of land purchases. Furthermore, the New Zealand government later disputed some of these agreements, as they contravened the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and over 500 Māori chiefs, which required that all land sales needed to go through the Crown. In response to these issues, the New Zealand government stepped in to establish a process for investigating and verifying land purchases, known as the Land Claims Commission, which was set up in 1840. The Commission scrutinized the land purchase agreements between the New Zealand Company and the Māori tribes and found that many of them were not valid. Despite these controversies, the New Zealand Company continued to play a vital role in the colonization of New Zealand, establishing several settlements and attracting thousands of settlers to the country. However, it faced numerous difficulties, including land disputes and financial troubles, which ultimately led to its dissolution in 1850. From that point on, the British Crown assumed direct responsibility for managing land purchases and the colonization process in New Zealand. In summary, the New Zealand Company mainly bought land from the indigenous Māori people before selling it to settlers, albeit through a process marred by misunderstandings and legal disputes. The role of the New Zealand Company, and its legacy, continues to be an important aspect of New Zealand's history, particularly in relation to Māori-European interactions and the development of modern landownership systems in the country."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

In retrospect, it's easy to think of Atkins picking jazz, but at the time it was still unusual for country artists to cross over. Those who know Homer & Jethro from their comedy records may be surprised by their top-notch guitar and mandolin playing. The material is a mix of pop and jazz, and the group (which included a changing line-up of session bassists, drummers and pianists, as well as fiddle player Dale Potter) gives most of these tunes a hillbilly twist. Haynes, Burns and Byrd each sing a few, but the real charm of these sessions is the high-spirited instrumental interplay.

These very small loans , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15...

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

A:","completion":"In the sixteenth century, the state of Michigan was densely forested with an abundance of elm and oak trees. However, during the twentieth century, vegetation clearance and replacement of the wooded areas with farmlands significantly changed the landscape and ecosystem in northeast Michigan. Heavy irrigation became a common practice in these farmlands. The water table is influenced by various factors, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, and human activities like irrigation and vegetation clearance. In the sixteenth century, northeast Michigan's landscape was dominated by forests, which play a crucial role in maintaining and regulating the water table. Forests, especially deep-rooted trees like elms and oaks, facilitate the process of evapotranspiration. This process, along with influxes of precipitation, helps to maintain a stable, deep water table, thus preventing the occurrence of shallow groundwater and salinization. However, the twentieth-century transformation of northeast Michigan witnessed an increase in human-induced changes to the landscape. Vegetation clearance for farmlands and heavy irrigation might have significantly altered the water table in the region. The removal of forests could have decreased the rate at which water is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. Coupled with this change, heavy irrigation in farmlands likely resulted in an increase in the local water table. Increased water table levels can lead to the mobilization of salts, which can have detrimental effects on the ecosystem, as mentioned in the background information. This process can result in increased soil salinization which reduces water uptake in plants and ultimately contributes to the decline of elm and oak populations in northeast Michigan. Therefore, while the actual data for water table levels from the sixteenth century in northeast Michigan might be unavailable, based on the potential change in the factors affecting the water table after the twentieth-century landscape changes, it is likely that the water table was at a more stable and deeper level in the sixteenth century than it was in the twentieth century following human-induced alterations like vegetation clearance and heavy irrigation practices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Another source of loanwords was Old Norse, which came into contact with Old English via the Scandinavian rulers and settlers in the Danelaw from the late 9th century, and during the rule of Cnut and other Danish kings in the early 11th century. Many place-names in eastern and northern England are of Scandinavian origin. Norse borrowings are relatively rare in Old English literature, being mostly terms relating to government and administration. The literary standard, however, was based on the West Saxon dialect, away from the main area of Scandinavian influence; the impact of Norse may have been greater in the eastern and northern dialects. Certainly in Middle English texts, which are more often based on eastern dialects, a strong Norse influence becomes apparent. Modern English contains a great many, often everyday, words that were borrowed from Old Norse, and the grammatical simplification that occurred after the Old English period is also often attributed to Norse influence. What language was a source for English loanwords that are still used today?","completion":"A source for English loanwords that are still used today is Old Norse, a language from Scandinavian people like the Vikings who lived a long time ago.

He played a crucial role in organizing and leading the Doolittle Raid, which was America's first offensive air operation against the Japanese mainland. The Doolittle Raid took place on April 18, 1942, and it was in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The operation, also known as the Tokyo Raid, involved 16 U.S. Army Air Forces B-25B Mitchell medium bombers launched from the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Hornet. The bombers took off from the carrier about 650 miles away from Japan and targeted Tokyo and several other cities. Although the raid did not cause extensive damage to the Japanese cities, it served as an important morale booster for the United States and a shock to the Japanese, who believed their homeland was beyond the reach of American military forces. The attack had several significant strategic effects. It convinced the Japanese to divert resources to homeland defense, contributing to their eventual defeat in the Pacific War. Furthermore, it demonstrated the potential of long-range bomber attacks, which was a key component of American air power strategy throughout the 20th century. After the Doolittle Raid, General Jimmy Doolittle continued to serve in the U.S. military, rising to the rank of Lieutenant General.

The primary goal of these plans was to create Lebensraum, or living space, for German settlers in the occupied Eastern Europe, which included large parts of the Soviet Union. Generalplan Ost aimed to eliminate, deport, or enslave the local Slavic and Jewish population to make room for German settlers. According to the plan, large numbers of people would be removed from their lands and homes, and their resources would be confiscated to support the German expansion. The Nazi Hunger Plan was a part of this broader strategy, designed specifically to divert the conquered regions' food and agricultural resources to feed the German army and settlers. The plan called for the deliberate starvation of the civilian population in the occupied territories, particularly in urban areas and the Soviet Union's food-producing regions. This would be achieved by prioritizing food and resource allocation to Germans and ruthlessly exploiting the local agricultural production. The food supply would be systematically cut off from the occupied populations, causing widespread famine and resulting in the planned death of millions of people. Though never fully realized, as the war progressed, elements of the Generalplan Ost and Hunger Plan were implemented, leading to the deaths of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war in the occupied territories, including the Soviet Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide. and a hint : A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Please answer this question : Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? A:","completion":"Reaction A, where sodium oxide is present in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate compared to reaction B, which uses sodium oxide in the form of large chunks. The reason for this difference in reaction rates lies in the surface area of the reactants. As the hint suggests, increasing the surface area of a reactant can increase the rate of a reaction. This is because a reactant with a larger surface area has more points of contact for other reactants, which allows for more frequent collisions between particles. More frequent collisions can lead to a higher probability of successful reactions. In reaction A, the small particles of sodium oxide provide a larger overall surface area than the large chunks used in reaction B. This means that there will be more opportunities for the sodium oxide particles to interact and react with other substances in the reaction mixture. Consequently, the increased surface area of the small particles allows reaction A to proceed more rapidly than reaction B. To further illustrate this concept, consider the example of burning wood. When you have a large log in a fire, it burns relatively slowly because the available surface area for combustion is limited. However, when you burn the same mass of wood in the form of small twigs, the combustion process is much faster because there is a greater surface area for the wood to interact with oxygen in the air. In conclusion, reaction A, which uses sodium oxide as small particles, will have a higher reaction rate due to the increased surface area, leading to more frequent and effective collisions between the reactant particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I can use this background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. Now, I have a new situation: Rob is a chemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to devise a technique that would be able to control chemical reactions. For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B. Answer this question please: In which reactants the particles would collide with greater force, reactant A or reactant B? Answer:","completion":"The particles would collide with greater force in reactant A. Here's the reasoning step-by-step: 1. As described in the background information, at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy. This energy tends to make them move faster. 2. This increased movement means they're more likely to bump into each other. 3. Moreover, when they do bump into each other, they're likely to do so with greater force because of their higher energy levels. 4. We know that Rob used warmer reactants for reactant A. Therefore, these reactants would be at a higher temperature compared to reactant B. 5. Given that temperature impacts the energy levels of the reactants and their resulting collisions, it follows that reactant A, being warmer, would result in particles colliding with greater force compared to reactant B. Thus, reasoning from the given background information and applying that to the specific scenario of Rob's tests, we conclude that the particles in reactant A would collide with greater force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: To cut the brownies to resemble legos Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of cutting brownies to resemble legos, it would be best to follow these detailed steps: 1. Bake the Brownies: First, prepare the brownie batter following your favorite recipe or use a store-bought mix. Make sure the batter is poured into a rectangular baking pan, which will provide enough space to create the desired lego shapes. 2. Choose the Lego Block Dimensions: In order to create lego-like brownies, you'll need to decide on the size of the blocks. A standard size for lego blocks could be approximately 2 x 2 or 2 x 4, depending on the size of brownie pieces you prefer. 3. Cool the Brownies: After baking, allow the brownies to cool completely since warm brownies will crumble and make it harder to achieve precise cuts. It may be beneficial to refrigerate the brownies for an hour to ensure they are firm enough for cutting. 4. Remove the Brownies from the Pan: Carefully remove the brownies from the pan using a spatula. Place them on a cutting board with the bottom side up for easier cutting and to retain the original texture on top. 5. Measure and Mark: Using a ruler and a knife, measure and score the brownies according to the pre-selected lego block dimensions. Ensure that the lines are straight and the measurements are consistent to create uniform lego shapes. 6. Cut the Brownies: Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the brownies along the scored lines. To prevent crumbling, it may be helpful to clean the knife between each cut. 7. Create the Lego Studs: To mimic the lego studs, you can use round candies like M&Ms or Skittles, or make them out of frosting. If using frosting, prepare a small piping bag with a round tip. For candies, simply place the desired number of pieces in a small bowl. 8. Attach the Studs: If using candies, use a small dab of frosting as an adhesive. Apply the frosting to the bottom of each candy and press it gently onto the brownie blocks, mimicking the stud placement of real lego blocks. If using frosting for the studs, carefully pipe small, round dots evenly spaced on the top surface of each brownie block. 9. Double-check the Appearance: After attaching the studs, double-check that the brownie blocks resemble legos. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure uniformity in size and stud placement. 10. Allow the Frosting to Set: If you used frosting for the studs or as adhesive for the candies, allow some time for the frosting to set before serving. By following these steps, you can create brownies resembling legos in a consistent and visually appealing manner. This detailed process ensures the creation of a fun and unique dessert that is sure to impress guests or make for a delightful treat for children and lego enthusiasts alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: \\"How to Play the Classic Board Game of Battleship: A Step-by-Step Guide\\" Introduction In the world of board gaming, few games have achieved such widespread popularity and recognition as Battleship. A strategy-oriented game with an engaging, military-themed premise, Battleship is an excellent way to boost your tactical skills while enjoying quality time with family and friends. Although the game has been around since the 1930s, its modern, mass-produced form arrived in the 1960s, with updated rules and features. This article will guide you through the process of setting up and playing the classic game of Battleship, whether you are a beginner or a seasoned player looking for a refresher. Setting Up the Game 1. Give each player a battleship box: In the standard Battleship game, two players compete against each other. Each player receives a plastic box, known as the battleship box, which consists of two grid systems. The top half is used to record the players' strikes and misses, while the lower half is meant for arranging their fleets. The box also serves as a convenient shield to maintain privacy and promote strategic thinking. 2. Check that all the ship pieces are there: Each player's fleet consists of five ships in distinct sizes and shapes, including a carrier, a battleship, a cruiser, a submarine, and a destroyer. Before starting the game, both players should ensure that their ship pieces are complete and undamaged. The necessary pieces include: a. Aircraft Carrier (5 grid spaces) b. Battleship (4 grid spaces) c. Cruiser (3 grid spaces) d. Submarine (3 grid spaces) e. Destroyer (2 grid spaces) 3. Have each player secretly arrange their ships: Players must strategically arrange their respective fleets on the bottom grid of their battleship boxes. This process is conducted in secrecy, with each player positioning their ships either horizontally or vertically, without touching one another or overlapping. The ships can be repositioned at any time before the game begins, allowing players to reconsider their strategy if desired. Some Battleship sets come equipped with small pegs to secure the ships in place on the grid, ensuring that they do not move throughout gameplay. 4. Decide who will play first: Before beginning the game, the players need to decide who will go first. This can be achieved through a coin toss, a game of rock-paper-scissors, or any mutually agreeable method. The first player assumes the role of the attacker, while the second player is the defender, waiting to retaliate once the initial move is made. Playing the Game 1. Call out the shot: With both players having positioned their fleets, the first player calls out a coordinate that corresponds to the square they wish to strike on their opponent's board. For example, \\"B5\\" denotes the intersection of the B column and the 5 row. 2. Determine if it's a hit or miss: The defender now checks the called coordinate on their grid to see if one of their ships occupies that square. If a ship is present, the defender announces a \\"hit.\\" The attacker inserts a red peg onto the corresponding square on their top grid as a record of the hit. If no ships occupy the targeted square, the defender calls out \\"miss,\\" and the attacker denotes this by inserting a white peg in that square. 3. Take turns: Following the initial move, players take turns attacking their opponents, calling out targeted coordinates and recording the outcomes on their grids. The defender is now able to counterattack, and this volley continues until one player's fleet is entirely sunk. 4. Winning the game: The objective of the Battleship game is to be the first player to sink all the opposing player's ships by successfully hitting each square that a ship occupies on their grid. A ship is considered sunk when all its grid spaces have been targeted by the opponent. The victorious player is the one who can annihilate their opponent's fleet before suffering the same fate. Conclusion Battleship is a timeless classic that has maintained its charm and appeal over several generations of board game enthusiasts. Its simple rules, engaging gameplay, and tactical depth make it an ideal choice for both casual and avid gamers alike. You can't go wrong with a round of Battleship to test your strategic thinking and, most importantly, enjoy some valuable recreational time with friends and family.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: What is the best environment for fossils to form in? The best environment for fossils to form is in areas where the conditions promote rapid burial and preservation of remains, preventing decomposition and destruction by scavengers or natural elements. Several factors contribute to making an environment favorable for fossil formation. 1. Sedimentary rock: Fossils are primarily found within sedimentary rocks like shale, limestone, and sandstone. These rocks are formed when sediment accumulates in layers over time and eventually hardens into rock. Sedimentary environments, such as riverbeds, swamps, lakes, and shallow marine environments, provide ideal conditions for fossil formation. 2. Rapid burial: When an organism dies, it must be rapidly buried in sediment to prevent exposure to scavengers, bacteria, and weathering. Rapid burial helps preserve the organism's remains intact, increasing the chances of fossilization. 3. Anoxic conditions: Fossil formation is more likely in environments with low oxygen levels. A lack of oxygen slows down decomposition and discourages scavengers, preserving the remains. This can occur in deep marine environments or in waterlogged soils like those found in swamps or bogs. 4. Low-energy environments: Fossils are best preserved in low-energy environments where sediment is deposited gently without eroding or destroying the remains. In high-energy environments, like fast-moving rivers or areas with strong tidal forces, remains can be easily broken or scattered, decreasing the likelihood of fossil formation. 5. Mineral-rich water: The presence of mineral-rich groundwater can aid in fossil formation. Minerals can infiltrate the remains and aid in the hardening process, helping to create a more complete and durable fossil record. Question 2: What is the best model of watch in Fossil brands? Fossil is a well-known brand that offers a wide range of stylish and functional watches. The \\"best\\" model will depend on an individual's preferences, needs, and budget.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden. After reading the above, is \\"Telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Nashri's defiance led to what event?\\"? Choices: - no. - yes.","completion":"yes. Nashiri's defiance led to him telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. This statement shows his disagreement with Bin Laden's reported decision to replace Khamri and Nibras, as Nashiri believed they were prepared for the mission.

None of the above choices .. C). The other team will stop the match .. D). The other team will go ahead ..","completion":"D). The other team will go ahead. After the Quaffle grazed his fingers, the most plausible outcome would be that the other team carries on with the game while trying to take advantage of their opponents' potential weakness. This scenario fits the spirit of the sport, where competitiveness and quick reactions are crucial. In the magical sport of Quidditch - as seen in the famous Harry Potter series - the game is fast-paced, with players continuously competing to outmaneuver each other. When the Quaffle grazed his fingers, it showed a momentary lapse in his ability to grasp the ball, which consequently led to the opposing team scoring. Given the highly competitive nature of Quidditch matches, the other team is unlikely to stop the match (option C) or get medical attention (option A) unless there is a genuine and serious injury. In this situation, the player did not appear to have sustained any significant harm but rather experienced a fleeting moment of inaccuracy. As such, it wouldn't warrant a pause in the game or any medical intervention. Based on the provided context, options A and C can be ruled out for the reasons stated above. Option B, \\"None of the above choices,\\" can also be dismissed as there is a viable choice among the given options. Finally, option D seems the most fitting and realistic choice, considering the sport's nature and the specific incident where the Quaffle grazed the player's hands.

Answer the following question: The Morning After Robot From today's newspaper, I know that in 2014 you might get a Morning After Robot. It will clean your house after a party. The Robot can take picture of your room before the party. After the party, the robot will go around the room, and it will pick up bottles and trash. After that it will compare the room with the picture and put things back according to its original shape. Such robots are being studied in a lab at Stanford University. That sounds pretty cool! If we can see the robot and have enough money, we must buy them. Robot Roomba Mothers' Day is coming. You can give Robot Roomba as a gift to your mother. The Roomba is a great gift for two reasons. On the one hand, it's really cool as a useful robot. It can actually clean your floor. Maybe not as fast or well as a person does, but it is a lot more fun cleaning the floor by the Roomba than cleaning the floor yourself. On the other hand, it shows the family life is very modern. What's the disadvantage of the Roomba? A) It doesn't clean the floor as quietly as a person does. B) It doesn't clean the floor as clean as a person does. C) It doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. D) There is less fun using it. Answer:","completion":"C) It doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. The Roomba, a popular robotic vacuum cleaner, has brought convenience in the cleaning realm, especially for those who have busy lifestyles or would rather allocate their time to other tasks. Although it has become a sought-after gadget for its incredible innovation, it is important to understand both the advantages and disadvantages associated with this device. As mentioned in the provided information, the Roomba is a fantastic gift for Mother's Day, as it showcases both modernity in family life and adds an element of fun to a typically monotonous household chore. The robot is designed to navigate a room and clean surfaces autonomously, minimizing the effort required in maintaining clean floors. However, despite its convenience, the Roomba has its limitations. The disadvantage is that it doesn't clean the floor as fast or well as a person does. This performance gap stems from a few factors: 1. Speed: The Roomba uses advanced algorithms and sensors to clean a room, but its movement is often slower compared to how quickly a human can clean the same space. This is because the robot might need to adjust its path, avoid obstacles, and go over certain spots multiple times to ensure thorough cleaning. 2. Precision: While the Roomba is designed to navigate around objects and avoid collisions, it may fail to reach tight spots or corners, leading to incomplete cleaning. A human cleaner can easily move objects like furniture or target specific areas that need extra attention. 3. Floor type: The Roomba is designed to work on different floor surfaces like hardwood, tile, or carpet. However, its efficiency varies depending on the type and texture of the floor. A human cleaner, on the other hand, can adjust their cleaning techniques according to the floor type and deliver more thorough results. 4. Cleaning stubborn dirt: The Roomba may struggle with deeply embedded dirt, grime, or stains, as its suction power and brushes may not be as effective as human cleaning using various tools and cleaning solutions. Despite the stated disadvantage, the Roomba still brings value and convenience to households, offering busy individuals a practical solution for maintaining a cleaner living space. However, it is essential to recognize its limitations and understand that occasional manual cleaning might be necessary for more thorough results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season. This would mark Urlacher's final game in a Bears' uniform. Urlacher was inactive for the final four games of the 2012 season, and he retired from the NFL on May 22, 2013.

A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal. - Herbert Spencer Gasser ( 5 July 1888 -- 11 May 1963 ) was an American physiologist , and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for his work with action potentials in nerve fibers while on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis , awarded jointly with Joseph Erlanger . - Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874 December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements. - In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for (or assisting in, with regard to saltatory conduction) the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon towards boutons at the axon ends which can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as \\"nerve impulses\\" or \\"spikes\\", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its \\"spike train\\". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to \\"fire\\". - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.

Check my flickr\\": - \\"@karohemd\\" is a mention of another user, which generally indicates a conversational or social tone. - \\"looks tasty!\\" expresses positive sentiment, with the use of the exclamation mark adding emphasis. - \\"I did cook today, though\\" adds context to the message but doesn't provide any specific sentiment.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Tops GOP Field in New Hampshire, Second in Iowa: Poll Donald Trump isn’t just the leading Republican candidate in the national polls – a barometer of name recognition – he is now looking strong in the early presidential nominating states where voters are paying attention. An NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday found the New York developer in first place among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and two percentage points behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in Iowa. Mr. Trump carries 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary electorate, a decisive lead over second-place Jeb Bush, who had 14%, the poll found. In Iowa, Mr. Trump is at 17%, with Mr. Walker at 19%. The poll found a strong early showing in New Hampshire for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who at 7% is in fourth place among GOP voters there. Mr. Kasich, who formally launched his presidential campaign Monday, has just 2% support in Iowa, good for 11th place among the 17 Republican candidates tested. Until now, Mr. Trump had been in the lead of national polling but Mr. Walker and Mr. Bush led opinion surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire, home to the nation’s first two presidential nominating contests. Mr. Trump campaigned Saturday in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where he attacked the Wisconsin governor for the first time. Mr. Trump said “the gloves are off” after a fundraiser for Mr. Walker called Mr. Trump “DumbDumb” in an invitation to an event later this week. Mr. Trump’s polling rise comes as he seems to have weathered the initial public storm over his belittling of Sen. John McCain’s war record. The NBC/Marist poll was conducted before and after Mr. Trump said Mr. McCain “is not a war hero.” Mr. Trump’s standing in Iowa increased after he made the incendiary remark, though he lost ground in New Hampshire, according to the poll. Perhaps working in Mr. Trump’s favor is that twice as many Republican voters in both Iowa and New Hampshire said they’d prefer a GOP nominee who shares their positions on issues over one who has the best chance of retaking the White House for the party. The polling landmines for Mr. Trump are the same as they have been. Some 44% of the Iowa Republican electorate and 53% of the New Hampshire GOP voters have an unfavorable view of him, far more than the other leading candidates tested. Mr. Bush is next with about one-third of GOP voters in each early state viewing him unfavorably. Among Democratic presidential candidates the NBC/Marist poll found Hillary Clinton with a commanding percentage in Iowa (55%) over challengers Bernie Sanders (26%) and Martin O’Malley (4%). If Vice President Joe Biden was included, Mr. Sanders’s share dropped to just 7%. Mr. Biden hasn’t ruled out a presidential campaign but has done nothing to organize a run. Mrs. Clinton’s lead in New Hampshire is smaller – just 47% to 34% over Mr. Sanders. The NBC/Marist poll surveyed 919 registered voters in Iowa. The New Hampshire poll surveyed 910 registered voters. Each took place from July 14-21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ______________________________________________________ Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

If you really want to make a good impression, be open to letting your date pick the movie for the date. Let them choose what they want to see. They may see this as a sweet and accommodating gesture. For example, you may ask them, “Hey, Chuck, what do you want to see?” or “Any new movies out you really want to see?” If you'd like to have more of a say, have a discussion about which movie you go see. Throw out a few options to your date and then agree on the movie together. That way, you can both enjoy the movie. Agreeing on the movie together can also show your date that you are willing to compromise, which can be an attractive quality in a romantic partner. For example, you may say, “Why don't we compromise and see a comedy?” or “What about going to see something we both like?” Going to the movies is generally considered a casual setting for a date. Do not over dress by wearing a party dress or a tie. Instead, wear clothing that makes you feel confident and comfortable. If you are really into your date and want to look sexy, you may take it up a notch by wearing heels, a dress, or a collared shirt. Once you have agreed on a movie, contact your date and confirm the meet up time by calling or texting them. Make sure you include a note about how excited you are for the date when you confirm the time. For example, you may text, \\"See you at the Westbrook theater at 7 pm. Looking forward to it :)\\" or call them and say, \\"Meet you outside the theater at 6:30. Can't wait!\\" Plan ahead so you arrive 5-10 minutes early for the movie. This can allow you to get any last minute jitters out and feel calm for the date. You may wait for your date in front of the theater or get their ticket for them while you are waiting, if you'd like. Another option is to arrange to meet with your date early at the theater so you can get snacks and good seats before the movie starts.

News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood.

Canada earned the spots after finishing second in the Union Cycliste International (UCI) America Tour as of Dec. 31. The three riders ultimately selected to fill the spots will join 142 other riders from 59 other nations and the Tripartite Commission. \\"Establishing our quotas early gives us time to work more collaboratively with our top athletes and their professional trade teams to ensure we get the right guys to Rio, with the right build-up race programs\\", said Kevin Field, Cycling Canada's men's elite road manager.

Riders will have to make four laps of the Grumari National Park circuit before zooming along the Vista Chinesa circuit through the Tijuca forest —which includes an 8.9-kilometre climb with gradients as high as 10 per cent — and along Ipanema beach back to Copacabana. \\"Our riders are excited the courses will be challenging,\\" said Field. \\"We have guys who can be very competitive and the internal work is well under way to narrow our selections to our best three riders.\\" \\"Our job now will be to select the riders best suited to be competitive in both the men's road race and the time trial,\\" said Jacques Landry, Cycling Canada's high performance director.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" Question: What Nicolette thought about King's welfare? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Nicolette thought that most people in the room, including the King's family and courtiers, were more worried about their own welfare than the King's. She felt irritated by their whispers and believed they were not doing much to alleviate the King's suffering. However, Nicolette herself was attending to the King and trying to make him as comfortable as possible, showing her genuine concern for his welfare."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Opening the enchanting table is your first step into a world of enchantments, where the impossible becomes possible. So, take a deep breath and embark on an adventure by right-clicking on the enchantment table in Minecraft. Step Two: The Book of Magic The object that holds the magic spell is a book. An ordinary book turns into an imbibed manuscript filled with potent enchantments once it interacts with the enchanting table. Once you have opened the enchantment table, move the book into the table's slot. By doing this, you prepare the book to receive the magic that will eventually be stored within its pages. Step Three: Essence of Enchantment - Lapis Lazuli The enchantment process requires a special ingredient, lapis lazuli. This vibrant-blue mineral possesses the essence required to translate the abstract enchantment into a functional form within the book. This step is crucial, as without lapis lazuli, there can be no enchantment. To do this, simply place your lapis lazuli into the designated slot in the enchanting table. This will set the enchantment's power level. Step Four: Choosing Your Enchantment Now comes the most exciting part - choosing your enchantment. The enchantment options will appear once the book and lapis lazuli are in their rightful places. You will be presented with a selection of enchantments, each represented by hieroglyph-like symbols and ranging from simple to superior, depending on your enchantment table level. Your choice of enchantment depends largely on your character's requirements and the kind of power you want to equip them with. Select your enchantment by clicking on the glyphs representing the enchantment you desire. Remember, each enchantment has unique capabilities, and your choice will tailor your character's abilities in the Minecraft world. Step Five: Claim Your Enchanted Book Once you have selected your enchantment, the book will glow, indicating that it's now an enchanted book. It's time to move the enchanted book to your inventory. The enchanted book contains the magic you have selected, ready to be used when needed. Drag and drop the newly enchanted book into your inventory. Step Six: Repeat As Necessary And there you have it! You've successfully enchanted a book. But mastering the art of enchanting doesn't stop here. Depending on your needs, you can repeat this process as often as necessary, giving you a wide range of enchanted books at your disposal. Each time you follow these steps, you'll find yourself delving deeper into the magical realm of Minecraft, equipping you to face every challenge that comes your way with an enchanted edge.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: TOKYO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Japan’s Shionogi & Co said on Tuesday that it has applied to health regulators in the United States, Canada and Europe for approval of its HIV drug Dolutegravir. Shionogi developed Dolutegravir with a Viiv Healthcare, an AIDS drug joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, in exchange for its rights to the drug. Hypothesis: The United States along with Canada will approve of the HIV drug","completion":"Based on the provided context, we can draw the following hypothesis: Hypothesis: The United States, Canada, and Europe's health regulators are currently considering the approval of Shionogi & Co's HIV drug, Dolutegravir, which was developed in partnership with Viiv Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the United States and Canada, or any of the mentioned health regulators, will approve the HIV drug just based on the information provided. The approval process usually consists of multiple stages, and the drug's safety and efficacy have to be evaluated thoroughly by the respective health authorities before a decision is made. At this stage, we can deduce that Shionogi & Co is seeking regulatory approval from health authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe. This implies that the company believes their drug might meet the requirements needed to get approved, which typically include passing through various clinical trials to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness and safety. Considering that Shionogi developed Dolutegravir in collaboration with Viiv Healthcare, which is a joint venture between two major pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, it's plausible that the drug candidate has been developed through rigorous research and development processes and has the potential for approval. These companies most likely have experience in gaining approval for similar drugs in the past, so they may have strategized and designed the drug development process accordingly. However, it is important to remember that the approval of a drug is not guaranteed, even if it comes from a collaboration between renowned pharmaceutical companies. The regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe have the responsibility to ensure public health and safety and will thus carefully evaluate the characteristics and performance of Dolutegravir in clinical trials. Therefore, only after assessing all the relevant data, including the drug's safety profile and effectiveness in treating HIV, will these regulatory bodies make their decision. In conclusion, it is not possible to confirm the hypothesis that the United States and Canada will approve Shionogi & Co's HIV drug solely based on the context provided. The hypothesis can only state that the company has applied for approval, not that approval will be granted. To know the outcome of the approval process, we would need information on the results of the clinical trials, feedback from the health regulatory agencies, and eventually, the official announcement of their decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason behind this trouble is the ongoing argument in higher education between lecturers and employers over pay.The Association of University Teachers(AUT)are currently taking industrial action because of the fact that lecturers have been underpaid for years.Vice-presidents of the universities,who enjoy six-figure salaries,are not making any noises to suggest that this will change in the near future.

A:","completion":"To answer the question \\"What types of microscopes do not require a vacuum?\\" let's analyze the given answer and consider any additional information needed. Step 1: Understanding the given answer The provided answer says \\"The electron microscope uses electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses to control the electron beam and focus it to form an image.\\" It mainly describes how an electron microscope works. Step 2: Identifying the relevance of the given answer Unfortunately, this answer doesn't address the original question directly, which asks about microscopes not requiring a vacuum. Step 3: Providing a reasonable answer based on general knowledge Microscopes that do not require a vacuum include light microscopes, such as compound microscopes and stereo microscopes, which use visible light and lenses to magnify the sample. Electron microscopes, on the other hand, use electron beams and require a vacuum to function properly. Step 4: Formulating a final answer So, a reasonable answer to the question would be: \\"Light microscopes, such as compound and stereo microscopes, do not require a vacuum for operation.\\" Although the given statement provides information about electron microscopes, it is not a reasonable answer to the question as it does not address the microscopes that do not require a vacuum."},{"prompt":"This article: Stanford did not employ a full-time professor in religion until 1951 and did not establish a religious studies department until 1973, later than most other universities in the U.S. Earlier courses in religion were largely offered by the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church. David Charles Gardner offered a course in Biblical history and literature beginning in 1907, and by 1910, he was teaching New Testament Greek and Bible classes. Gardner's successor, D. Elton Trueblood, whose goal was the establishment of a non-denominational graduate school in religious studies at Stanford, taught classes about the philosophy of religion. In 1941 Trueblood's efforts to expand the study of religion resulted in the creation of a minor in religion, as well as twenty-one courses offered by him and four faculty members. By 1960, the chaplains of Stanford Memorial Church no longer had to run the program, which had expanded to allow students the option of majoring in the study of religion.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, answer the following question. After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Select from: [1]. Fans of macaroni and cheese.; [2]. Overweight or obese.; [3]. not enough information; [4]. University researchers.; Answer:","completion":"[2].

In the early 1980s, McKenna began to speak publicly on the topic of psychedelic drugs, becoming one of the pioneers of the psychedelic movement. His main focus was on the plant-based psychedelics such as psilocybin mushrooms (which were the catalyst for his career), ayahuasca, cannabis, and the plant derivative DMT. He conducted lecture tours and workshops promoting natural psychedelics as a way to explore universal mysteries, stimulate the imagination, and re-establish a harmonious relationship with nature. Though associated with the New Age and Human Potential Movements, McKenna himself had little patience for New Age sensibilities. He repeatedly stressed the importance and primacy of the \\"felt presence of direct experience\\", as opposed to dogma. In addition to psychedelic drugs, McKenna spoke on a wide array of subjects including; shamanism; metaphysics; alchemy; language; culture; self-empowerment; environmentalism, techno-paganism; artificial intelligence; evolution; extraterrestrials; science and scientism; the Web; virtual reality (which he saw as a way to artistically communicate the experience of psychedelics); and aesthetic theory, specifically about art/visual experience as information representing the significance of hallucinatory visions experienced under the influence of psychedelics. McKenna soon became a fixture of popular counterculture with Timothy Leary once introducing him as \\"one of the five or six most important people on the planet\\" and with comedian Bill Hicks' referencing him in his stand-up act and building an entire routine around his ideas. McKenna also became a popular personality in the psychedelic rave/dance scene of the early 1990s, with frequent spoken word performances at raves and contributions to psychedelic and goa trance albums by The Shamen, Spacetime Continuum, Alien Project, Capsula, Entheogenic, Zuvuya, Shpongle, and Shakti Twins. In 1994 he appeared as a speaker at the Starwood Festival, documented in the book Tripping by Charles Hayes. McKenna published several books in the early-to-mid-1990s including: The Archaic Revival; Food of the Gods; and True Hallucinations. Hundreds of hours of McKenna's public lectures were recorded either professionally or bootlegged and have been produced on cassette tape, CD and MP3. Segments of his talks have gone on to be sampled by many musicians and DJ's. McKenna was a colleague and close friend of chaos mathematician Ralph Abraham, and author and biologist Rupert Sheldrake. He conducted several public and many private debates with them from 1982 until his death. These debates were known as trialogues and some of the discussions were later published in the books: Trialogues at the Edge of the West and The Evolutionary Mind.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.

Answer the following question: Information: - Freestyle BMX is bicycle motocross stunt riding on BMX bikes. It is an extreme sport descended from BMX racing that consists of five disciplines: street, park, vert, trails, and flatland. - A multi-sport event is an organized sports event, often held over multiple days, featuring competition in many different sports between organized teams of athletes from (mostly) nation states. The first major, modern, multi-sport event of international significance is the modern Olympic Games. - Jamie Alan Staff MBE ( born 30 April 1973 ) is an English racing cyclist and coach , formerly on BMX and later on the track . A World and Olympic champion , he has also won numerous other medals at World Championships , World Cups and at the Commonwealth Games . - Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. - The Commonwealth Games (known as the British Empire Games from 19301950, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games from 19541966, and British Commonwealth Games from 19701974) is an international, multi-sport event involving athletes from the Commonwealth of Nations. The event was first held in 1930, and, with the exception of 1942 and 1946, which were cancelled due to World War II, has taken place every four years since then. - BMX racing is a type of off-road bicycle racing. The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over. Professional ranks exist for both men and women, where the age ranges from 18 to 40 years old. - A BMX bike is an off-road sport bicycle used for racing and stunt riding. BMX means bicycle motocross. - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories. - Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom. - BMX, an abbreviation for bicycle motocross, is a cycle sport performed on BMX bikes, either in competitive BMX racing or freestyle BMX, or else in general on- or off-road recreation. BMX began when young cyclists appropriated motocross tracks for fun, racing and stunts, eventually evolving specialized BMX bikes and competitions.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? the premise of \`\` abandon '' holds promise ,","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"the premise of \`\`abandon'' holds promise,\\" can be interpreted as both positive and negative, depending on the context in which it is being used. Positive Interpretation: In this interpretation, the sentiment can be seen as positive because the sentence implies that the idea or concept of \\"abandon\\" can lead to promising outcomes. It suggests that there might be positivity or potential growth in letting go of certain things, ideas, or situations. This \\"abandon\\" may introduce new opportunities or a fresh start. Consequently, the underlying sentiment is one of hope and positive anticipation. An example of a positive interpretation might be a scenario where someone explores the idea of leaving their comfort zone to advance in life. Negative Interpretation: On the other hand, the sentiment might also be interpreted as negative. The word \\"abandon\\" inherently carries negative connotations, as it can imply losing something or giving up on something important. The sentence might be taken to suggest that the act of abandonment itself might be promising or even necessary, which can be seen as disheartening or saddening. An example of a negative interpretation may be a situation where a person has no choice but to leave something they cherish in order to move forward. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"the premise of \`\`abandon'' holds promise,\\" is subjective and could be perceived as both positive or negative, depending on the context and perception of the reader.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the couple that bought the two massive concrete chairs at the auction? Discussion of damming the White River for flood control began in the 1930s, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) held hearings on building a dam in January 1946. The new dam would create a lake 50 miles (80 km) long, and one arm would extend to Monte Ne. Work on Beaver Dam began in 1960 as the CoE impounded and bought land around the White River. In July 1962, Mary Powell sold Camp Joyzelle to the CoE, and W. T. McWhorten sold his land as well. The Federal Government required that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, and it was no easy task. In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.The CoE mistakenly believed that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover the area of the large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G.

Article: We often see wind-horse flags in Tibetan areas. They are long cloths on which pictures of horses and scriptures are printed. People often put these flags on top of houses, or leave them where a vehicle accident happened. They prevent evil spirits from injuring people again. A wind-horse flag can be white, yellow, red, green or blue. These five colors symbolize the five elements that form the world; earth, water, fire, wind and sky. Another explanations that red is the sun, green is the grassland, yellow is the earth, blue is the sky, and white is the cloud. The wind-horse flag originated with a monk who obtained a scripture from India. When he crossed a river, he carelessly dropped the scripture into the water. He quickly saved the scripture and spread it out on a big rock to dry as he sat in meditation . Suddenly violent thunder sounded like drums. The monk felt liberated from all of his sadness, and when he opened his eyes he saw that the scripture had been blown into the sky by a strong wind. Finally, he went straight to heaven. In order to honor the spirit of the monk and the Buddhist scripture, people printed the scripture on a piece of cloth and hung it up between the sky and the earth as though the scripture was flying in the sky. We also know why people put the wind-horse flag on the top of mountains and houses. The Tibetan ancestors had a very great idea about chanting scripture. They thought people not only could chant scripture, but also the five elements. The wind-home flag is a good example of how they use the wind to blow the flag, which means that the wind also chants scripture. Answer: The scripture was blown into the sky.","completion":"Question: What happened to the scripture when the monk opened his eyes after hearing violent thunder while meditating?"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It was clear to Victoria that this excessive attachment was unhealthy, and she felt a growing concern for her friend's well-being. Step 1: Assess the situation Searching for the right moment to bring up her concerns, Victoria spent more time with Katrina and Jake to properly assess their relationship. Her intent was not only to confirm her own perception but also to ensure her eventual advice would be helpful and appropriate. She paid attention to Jake's behavior patterns, Katrina's reactions, and the overall dynamics between the couple. Step 2: Offer support In providing her unwavering support, Victoria would frequently join Katrina and Jake during their outings or events. This allowed for casual conversations and a friendly atmosphere making it easier to broach sensitive topics. Additionally, being consistently available as a friend gave Katrina a sense of security in knowing that she could count on Victoria when needed. Step 3: Give gentle advice One day, the three of them went out for coffee. While Jake briefly stepped away to use the restroom, Victoria brought up her concerns about how clingy Jake seemed. Speaking with kindness and care, Victoria asked Katrina how she truly felt about the situation, and invited her to share her own thoughts and feelings. Step 4: Encourage communication Upon hearing Katrina's mixed feelings regarding her relationship, Victoria encouraged her friend to have an open and honest conversation with Jake. She reminded Katrina that it was important for both partners to understand each other's needs in order to maintain a healthy relationship. Step 5: Be a listening ear In the days that followed, Victoria made it a point to be there for Katrina, providing a listening ear and empathetic presence. This allowed Katrina to process her feelings and explore ways to address the issue with Jake. Victoria's support gave Katrina the reassurance that she had someone rooting for her wellbeing. Step 6: Respect boundaries When Katrina finally decided to have a conversation with Jake about her concerns, Victoria kindly stepped back, allowing her friend to navigate those delicate discussions on her own. By respecting Katrina's autonomy, she kept a close eye on the situation and offered her guidance only when requested. Step 7: Offer further support if needed In the end, Katrina's conversation with Jake went better than expected. He assured her that he would actively work on becoming less clingy and more aware of their respective boundaries. As they both moved forward, Victoria remained a constant source of support for her friend and offered her assistance if either of them needed it down the road.

At the end of your feeder hose, attach a hose manifold or multiple line splitters to accommodate the number of soaker hoses or sprinkler heads you need.

The first choice is incorrect because it discusses appliance placement and a \\"danger zone,\\" which are not related to setting up an irrigation system or the steps previously outlined.

The third choice is incorrect because it suggests letting water accumulate in the spigot for 10 to 15 years, which doesn't make sense in the context of installing an irrigation system.

After a disappointing loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked to bounce back against the lowly Vikings who were without Adrian Peterson who was suspended, but were led by ex-Patriot Matt Cassel at quarterback. The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended Adrian Peterson, Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards.

Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. At the end of the text, the author most likely still has a propensity towards what behavior? A. not enough information B. hoarding and holding on to items C. giving most things away D. teach others Answer:","completion":"B. hoarding and holding on to items"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

David found it easier to learn about elements by comparing their properties.

The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull.

Pluto's icy north pole shines in this image It may have demoted to a dwarf planet but this image shows that Pluto continues to confound and surprise scientists. The image from the New Horizon spacecraft showcases icy canyon’s on Pluto’s north pole. The long canyons run vertically across the polar area—part of the informally named Lowell Regio, named for Percival Lowell, who founded Lowell Observatory and initiated the search that led to Pluto’s discovery. The widest of the canyons is about 45 miles wide and runs close to the north pole. Roughly parallel subsidiary canyons to the east and west are approximately 6 miles wide. Unlike the canyons on other parts of Pluto, the degraded walls of these canyons appear to be much older and may provide evidence of ancient period of tectonics on the planet. Related: NASA releases dramatic new Pluto images Along with the canyons, you can see a shallow, winding valley that runs the entire length of the canyon floor as well as large, irregularly-shaped pits that reach 45 miles across and 2.5 miles deep. These pits may be where subsurface ice has melted from below, causing the ground to collapse. Another unusual quality of this region is the color. High elevations show up in a distinctive yellow, something not seen elsewhere on Pluto. The yellowish terrain fades to a bluish gray at lower elevations and latitudes and coincides with New Horizons' infrared measurements indicating methane ice is abundant across Lowell Regio.

Keep a supply of mints and gum at hand.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Tips for Stress-Free Travel: How to Manage Nausea and Stay Comfortable During Long Trips Introduction: Traveling can be an exciting adventure, but it can also bring about a variety of unwanted symptoms like motion sickness, upset stomachs, and general discomfort. With a few simple adjustments to your pre-trip routine and some smart in-transit strategies, you can greatly reduce these symptoms and enjoy a smoother journey. Step 1: Avoid greasy meals and alcohol before trips In the days leading up to a long trip, be mindful of your diet. Heavy, greasy meals and alcohol can exacerbate feelings of nausea and discomfort during travel. Instead, opt for lighter fare, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, which can help stabilize your stomach and prepare you for extended periods of motion. Step 2: Eat frequent, light meals When on the move, eating small, light meals throughout the day can help keep your stomach settled. Large meals can cause discomfort and even contribute to motion sickness, but by snacking regularly, your body will have a constant source of energy and maintain a steady balance. Step 3: Have bland, floury snacks in the car During travel, you should maintain a stock of bland, floury snacks in the car, such as crackers, cereal, or pretzels. These types of snacks can help absorb stomach acid and reduce feelings of nausea or discomfort. Additionally, they are easy to digest and unlikely to cause further upset. Step 4: Stay hydrated Staying hydrated is essential during travel, as dehydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, and irritability. Before and during your trip, ensure you are drinking plenty of water or natural electrolyte drinks. To avoid needing frequent restroom stops, try sipping small amounts of liquids consistently rather than gulping down large volumes. Step 5: Consume plenty of ginger Ginger has long been hailed as a natural remedy for many ailments, including motion sickness and nausea. Incorporate ginger into your pre-trip diet by adding it to meals or sipping on ginger tea. For a more portable option, purchase ginger candies or chews to bring with you during your trip. Consuming ginger regularly can help reduce nausea and keep your stomach calm. Step 6: Keep a supply of mints and gum at hand Sucking on mints or chewing gum can help alleviate feelings of nausea by stimulating saliva production, which aids in digestion and eases stomach discomfort. Additionally, the mild flavors of mint and other mild gums can refresh your palate and help mask any unpleasant tastes in your mouth that may contribute to nausea. Conclusion: A bit of thoughtful preparation and select items on hand can make all the difference in your travel experience. By following these tips, you can help prevent nausea, stay comfortable, and enjoy your well-deserved vacation to its fullest. By avoiding greasy meals and alcohol, eating light meals, packing the right snacks, staying hydrated, and utilizing ginger and mints, your next journey is sure to be a smooth ride."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andy is introduced in the season 3 premiere as the Regional Director in Charge of Sales at the Stamford branch, where Jim has transferred to. Early season episodes reveal his anger issues, displayed when he finds his calculator encased in Jell-O and when he performs poorly due to Jim's inexperience at Call of Duty. After the closure of Stamford and merger with Scranton, Andy attempts to gain favor with manager Michael Scott through his quoted tactics of \\"name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake\\". There is rivalry with Dwight Schrute over whether his title is higher than that of Dwight's Assistant Regional Manager, fueling an intense power struggle.

Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence, while it mentions Gray Davis and a connection to Los Angeles Superior Court in April 2000, does not provide explicit details about the nature of this association. The first sentence merely forms a timeline of professional progress and achievements of the individual in question, Gray Davis. It outlines a sequence of job positions throughout his career, specifically mentioning his appointments with different law firms. The sentence starts with \\"Gray Davis to Los Angeles Superior Court, April 2000,\\" but the phrase does not give clear information about how Gray Davis was related to the court during that time. He could have been representing a case there, or he might have been appointed for a temporary service. Moreover, the information about him being a partner at Morrison & Foerster from 1991-2000, a partner at Hufstedler, Kaus & Ettinger (and predecessor firms) from 1983-91, and an associate at Beardsley, Hufstedler & Kemble (and related firms) from 1977-82 is given. It concludes with his law education detail, stating that he graduated from Harvard Law School at the age of 49. However, nowhere does it signify his position or role in the Los Angeles Superior Court in April 2000 as suggested in the second sentence. So, we cannot definitely say that Gray Davis was associated with the court in April of 2000 based on the information given in the first sentence. For entailment to take place, the information in the first sentence must definitively affirm the information in the second sentence. Given this criterion, the second sentence is not necessarily entailed by the first sentence.

Sandra wants to go on vacation, and would like to go somewhere cold. Sandra will likely choose a place near the equator or near the poles? Answer:","completion":"Sandra, who is seeking a cold vacation destination, would likely choose a place near the poles rather than near the equator. This decision is based on Earth's distribution of heat and the distinct temperature differences between equatorial and polar regions. At the equator, Earth's surface receives sunlight directly due to the planet's unique structure and rotational dynamics. As a result, the Sun's rays strike the equator at a near-perpendicular angle, causing the solar radiation to be more concentrated and the temperatures to be higher. Tropical rainforests, for instance, can be found around the equator, characterized by high temperatures and humidity levels. In contrast, the polar regions receive significantly less direct sunlight because Earth's curvature angles the Sun's rays away from these areas. Consequently, the solar radiation gets much more diffused, leading to lower temperatures and the formation of cold environments like ice caps, glaciers, and permafrost. Moreover, the nature of Earth's axial tilt contributes to the fluctuation of temperatures and seasonality in these regions. Due to this tilt, the polar regions experience continuous sunshine during summer months, while winter months are characterized by prolonged darkness and freezing conditions. The equatorial regions, on the other hand, experience little variation in temperature and daylight throughout the year. Given Sandra's preference for a cold destination, she should opt for a location near the poles. Examples of such destinations include Antarctica, Greenland, Northern parts of Canada, Alaska, or the Scandinavian countries like Norway, Sweden, and Finland, where temperatures are much lower than the equator. These regions also offer a variety of cold-weather activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, ice fishing, or simply enjoying the distinctive landscapes and observing the fascinating wildlife that is well-adapted to the cold conditions. In conclusion, Sandra would be better off choosing a vacation destination near the poles if she desires a cold environment. The Earth's structure and rotation dynamics contribute substantially to the considerable temperature differences between the equator and the poles, making polar regions perfect locations to experience colder temperatures and unique winter activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: We have entered a new age of embedded , intuitive computing in which our homes, cars, stores, farms, and factories have the ability to think, sense, understand, and respond to our needs. It's not science fiction, but the dawn of a new age. Most people might not realize it yet, but we are already feeling the impact of what's known as the third wave of computing. In small but significant ways it is helping us live healthier and more secure lives. If you drive a 2014 Mercedes Benz, for example, an \\"intelligent\\" system tries to keep you from hitting a pedestrian. A farmer in Nigeria relies on weather sensors that communicate with his mobile device. Forgot your medicine? A new pill bottle from AdhereTech reminds you through text or automatic phone messages that it's time to take a pill. Technology is being integrated into our natural behaviors, with real-time data connecting our physical and digital worlds. With this dramatic shift in our relationship to technology, companies can adapt their products and services. To understand how revolutionary the third wave is, we ought to consider how far we have come. The first wave began when companies started to manage their operations through mainframe computer systems over 50 years ago. Then computing got \\"personal\\" in the 1980s and the 1990s with the introduction of the PC (personal computer). For the most part, computing remained immobile and lacked contextual awareness. In computing's second wave, mobile computing and the smartphone took center stage. Billions of people, some of whom might not have had access to clean water, electricity, or even housing, were connected. Developers created applications and provided consumers with access to just about everything through their phone at the cost of a monthly data plan.

Historically, designers have focused their attention on a product's form and function. While that still matters, of course, the...

A:","completion":"Woman magazine has a more direct focus on women's issues compared to Heat magazine. Although both publications are targeted at women, their content and approach to issues affecting women vary significantly. Woman is a leading women's lifestyle magazine that dates back to 1937. It primarily focuses on creating content that caters to women's interests, concerns, and needs. The magazine is known for providing its readers with a balanced mix of real-life stories, advice columns, fashion, beauty, health, and well-being tips, as well as essential discussions about relationships, family, work, and personal issues that affect women on a daily basis. The magazine also features celebrity interviews, but these are often centered around the personal lives and experiences of the celebrity from a woman's perspective. The articles and features in Woman magazine highlight the challenges and success stories of everyday women, empowering its readers by offering practical solutions, information, and inspiration. Woman takes a more sympathetic and understanding tone while touching on sensitive topics like mental health, body image, parenting, and women's rights. The magazine aims at building a community of like-minded women, connecting through shared experiences, and fostering a sense of solidarity and support among readers. Heat, on the other hand, is a British entertainment magazine that was first published in 1999. While it is primarily aimed at a female audience, its main focus is on celebrity gossip, television, and popular culture. The magazine's content includes news, interviews, and features about celebrities, along with articles on fashion, beauty, and lifestyle trends. Heat is known for its light-hearted, humorous, and sometimes sensational approach to journalism, with a penchant for capturing the latest scandals and showbiz stories. Although Heat does occasionally cover women's issues, it does so in a manner that is more superficial and entertainment-driven, rather than delving deep into the complex concerns that women face. Its primary goal is to keep its readers informed and entertained, rather than addressing serious issues or providing support to its female audience. In conclusion, Woman magazine has a more direct focus on women's issues, as it consistently prioritizes in-depth discussions, advice, and real-life stories that women can relate to and learn from. In contrast, Heat magazine is more invested in the world of celebrity news and entertainment, and while it touches on women's issues occasionally, it does so in a less comprehensive and profound manner."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, he is slowly going insane and sees a therapist frequently; it is during these sessions that his declining mental health becomes clear through a series of increasingly bizarre rants which eventually begin to scare even the psychiatrist. After he takes home a girl he met in a club named Jackie, a bat flies in through his window, scaring them both. At his next session he mentions to his therapist that the struggle with the bat aroused him, and after visiting an art museum with Jackie the next day, he ditches her, and she leaves an angry message on his phone. Loew meets Rachel at a night club, and takes her home. She pins him down, reveals vampire fangs and feeds on him. He soon begins to believe that he is changing into a vampire.

The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station's analog channel. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. As biographer Ben Proctor explains: During the 1920s he became an avowed Jeffersonian Democrat, warning his fellow citizens against the dangers of big government, of unchecked federal power that could infringe on the individual rights of Americans, especially if a charismatic leader was in charge....[After supporting FDR in 1932] Hearst soon became highly critical of the New Deal. With increasing frequency Hearst newspapers supported big business to the detriment of organized labor. With unabated vigor they condemned higher income tax legislation as a persecution of the \\"successful.\\" Hearst broke with FDR in spring 1935 when the president vetoed the Patman Bonus Bill for veterans and tried to enter the World Court. Hearst's papers were his weapon. They carried the publisher's rambling, vitriolic, all-capital-letters editorials, but he no longer employed the energetic reporters, editors, and columnists who might have made a serious attack. He reached 20 million readers in the mid 1930s, but they included much of the working class that Roosevelt had swept by three-to-one margins in the 1936 election. The Hearst papers--like most major chains--had supported the Republican Alf Landon that year. In 1934, after checking with Jewish leaders to ensure a visit would be to their benefit, Hearst visited Berlin to interview Adolf Hitler.

George can't stand exercising. Instead, he prefers to lay around relaxing and driving his car if he needs to go somewhere. and a hint : Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Please answer this question : Who has a higher risk of hypertension? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that George has a higher risk of hypertension. The reason for this assumption is that George has a more sedentary lifestyle compared to Jerry, as he prefers to lay around relaxing and avoids exercise. In contrast, Jerry rides his bike several miles each week, which indicates that he engages in regular physical activity. The hint provided mentions that any unused energy in food is stored as fat, and people who consistently consume more energy than they need may become obese. Obesity, with a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m² or greater, increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Background: Third Eye Blind is an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1993. The songwriting duo of Stephan Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan signed the band's first major label recording contract with Elektra Records in 1996, which was later reported as the largest publishing deal ever for an unsigned artist. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1997, with the band largely consisting of Jenkins (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Cadogan (lead guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), and Brad Hargreaves (drums). Shortly after the release of the band's second album in 1999, Blue, with the same line-up, Cadogan was released from the band under controversial circumstances. Context: A single, \\"Non-Dairy Creamer,\\" was released in November 2008 and was part of the internet exclusive digital EP Red Star. Third Eye Blind's fourth studio album Ursa Major was released on August 18, 2009. The album had been anticipated since mid-2007 and was previously expected to be named The Hideous Strength. The album was released under their own label, Mega Collider Records. Third Eye Blind topped the Billboard Rock Albums chart, Top Alternative Albums chart, and Top Digital Albums chart with Ursa Major. The band released only one official single from the record, \\"Don't Believe a Word\\", on June 16, 2009; it was released to radio on July 7, 2009. \\"Bonfire\\" was also released as a radio-exclusive single. Neither charted on any radio formats. The band toured in support of the album throughout the end of 2009. However, longtime guitarist Tony Fredianelli was fired from the band in early 2010. According to an article which quotes a lengthy letter of his, Fredianelli \\"is suing the band for apparently being denied songwriting credits and benefits that he allegedly was entitled to.\\" On February 23, 2011, it was revealed that Fredianelli had filed a federal lawsuit against Jenkins for over 8 million in damages for not giving him credit for past work with the band. On October 21, 2013, a California jury awarded Fredianelli more than 438,000. According to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, the jury also asked to award royalties to the guitarist, but the judge had previously ruled against it. Irish musician Kryz Reid replaced Fredianelli on guitar, while Third Eye Blind continued to tour in support the album in 2010, most notably co-headlining The Bamboozle Roadshow between May and June 2010. The band entered the studio as early as 2010 to start work on a fifth album. Around the timeframe of Ursa Major's release, the band spoke of an Ursa Minor album that would have contained songs that were recorded over Ursa Major's recording sessions but ultimately were left off the album. While the band spoke of releasing them in close succession to each other, in a similar fashion to a double album, Ursa Minor was not released. Question: Who are Red Star and Ursa Major?.

Overnight the clouds had rolled in and the summer was dead. I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain. Somebody knocked at the door and I swiveled around to see Pete McGreggor from down the hall. \\"Busy?\\" he asked. I shook my head and he came in, closing the door behind him.

A more suitable and detailed answer to the question would be: Geotrichum candidum is a fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota and the class Saccharomycetes. It can be found ubiquitously in numerous environments across the world, ranging from soil, water, and air to plant and animal tissue. It is a common saprotroph, meaning it feeds on dead organic material, and can be isolated from decaying plant matter, compost piles, silage, and sewage. Furthermore, Geotrichum candidum has also been found to be part of the natural microbial flora on human skin, the nasal cavity, the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract, and the genital area. It is used in various industrial applications, such as the fermentation of milk, cheese, and yoghurt, providing specific taste, texture, and appearance properties. Some examples of cheese made with Geotrichum candidum include Camembert, Saint-Nectaire, and Munster. The fungus not only contributes to the flavor profile of these products, but it can also help prevent the growth of undesired microorganisms due to its ability to compete for the same nutrients. Although Geotrichum candidum has beneficial applications, it can cause infections known as geotrichosis in immunocompromised individuals. These infections may manifest as pulmonary, oral, or skin infections and are typically treated with antifungal medications such as caspofungin, micafungin, or fluconazole. In summary, Geotrichum candidum is a fungus that can be found in a wide variety of environments worldwide, and it serves various roles, from participating in natural decomposition processes to lending unique characteristics in fermented dairy products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What opens the musical? Movie title: Evita Movie plot: A movie version of the highly successful musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice, \\"Evita\\" is the story of Argentina's most controversial First Lady, Eva Perón (1919 - 1952.) Her awe-inspiring funeral, attended by seven million devoted followers, is the opening to the musical, with the narrator then brining the story back by over a decade, explaining how a B-movie actress became the object of such controversial devotion.Trapped and bored with her family in rural Argentina in the late 1930s, Eva Duarte (Madonna) convinces a womanising musician (Jimmy Nail) to take her with him, back to the capital city, Buenos Aires, where she is determined to become a star. After being abandoned by the musician, Eva endures humiliations and poverty before using her feminine wiles to climb the ladder of the city's entertainment scene, eventually becoming a well-paid radio and film actress.At a benefit to aid the victims of an earthquake she meets Colonel Juan Perón (Jonathan Pryce), an ambitious politician with designs on the presidency. They fall in love and Eva encourages his plans to become dictator of the country, even using her star power to get him released from prison when his enemies order his arrest. On February 24 1946, Perón is elected president with a huge majority, but it quickly becomes apparent that its his glamorous wife who's the focus of the people's love.Affectionately nicknamed 'Evita' by her millions of devoted followers, Eva founds a huge charity to alleviate the suffering of the nation's poor. Throughout it all, the beautiful first lady is dressed in the latest high fashion and she is accused of being a distraction for the people, rather than an aid, by the embittered and cynical narrator (Antonio Banderas.) With millions of people still utterly devoted to her, Evita continues to appear in public, dazzling her supporters and enfuriating her enemies, despite being secretly consumed with terminal cancer. At the end of the musical, she dies, aged 33, resulting in hysterical mourning throughout...

They want all of us to cringe -- and they have succeeded. The Islamic radicals suddenly barreling across Iraq want to make sure people are horrified at their deeds. Leaders of the organization that calls itself ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have launched a sophisticated propaganda campaign that turns the most basic principles of public relations on their head. No PR executive would advise a client to shout to the world details of his most gruesome acts and the extent of his cruelty, but that is precisely what ISIS is doing, and doing so very deliberately. The images of mass executions, of men digging their own graves before being shot in the back of the head, are splashed on the world's newspapers, television news and social media. The organization had it start in Iraq, when its videotaped beheadings of hostages and its bombings of civilians in the streets proved too much even for OPTIONS: - Frida Ghitis. - Ghitis. - ISIS. - Iraq. - Iraqis. - Islamic. - Islamic State of Iraq. - PR. - Syria. - al Qaeda.","completion":"the al Qaeda leadership, which disowned the group. Since then, ISIS has grown in strength and scope, evolving into a formidable force that seeks to create its own state, or caliphate, spanning Iraq and Syria. In order to achieve its goals and gain support, the group employs a multifaceted PR strategy that is both terrifying and effective. Step 1: Establish social media presence To spread its message globally, ISIS has established a strong presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. By doing this, the group can quickly share information, graphic images, and videos of its actions, gaining both notoriety and, in some cases, sympathy from its followers. Step 2: Frame the narrative ISIS's propaganda campaign is carefully crafted to present a specific narrative, one that seeks to justify its actions as a response to Western aggression and as a means of upholding Islamic principles. By framing its actions this way, the group hopes to garner support from both local populations and those living in the West who may be disillusioned with their own governments. Step 3: Employ shock tactics The use of graphic images and videos of mass executions, beheadings, and other acts of extreme violence is a calculated shock tactic employed by ISIS. By sharing these images on social media and ensuring they are seen by a global audience, the group aims to instill fear, provoke outrage, and ultimately, force the hand of Western governments to respond. Step 4: Recruit new members The shocking nature of ISIS's propaganda also serves as a recruitment tool. Potential recruits, particularly those who may feel marginalized or alienated in their own societies, may be drawn to the group's message of power and vengeance. The images of violence and brutality may also attract those who wish to commit such acts and feel a sense of purpose in doing so. Step 5: Establish credibility and gain legitimacy By showcasing its military successes and territorial gains, ISIS seeks to establish credibility as a formidable and successful fighting force. This can attract financial support from those who believe the group can successfully challenge its enemies and fulfill its stated goal of establishing an Islamic caliphate. In conclusion, ISIS has turned traditional PR on its head, using shocking images and its strategic narrative to spread fear, gain support, and recruit new members. While this approach has undoubtedly been effective in terms of gaining global attention and spreading fear, it remains to be seen whether it can ultimately achieve the group's long-term goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER XVIII I THOUGH he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply discussed every detail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together Babbitt was no more conscious of his children than of the buttons on his coat-sleeves. The admiration of Kenneth Escott made him aware of Verona. She had become secretary to Mr. Gruensberg of the Gruensberg Leather Company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the people who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing something desperate--of leaving a job or a husband--without ever doing it. Babbitt was so hopeful about Escott's hesitant ardors that he became the playful parent. When he returned from the Elks he peered coyly into the living-room and gurgled, \\"Has our Kenny been here to-night?\\" He never credited Verona's protest, \\"Why, Ken and I are just good friends, and we only talk about Ideas.

What is the answer: What infectious disease, caused by a virus, is characterised by the eruption of successive crops of blisters?","completion":"The infectious disease, caused by a virus, that is characterized by the eruption of successive crops of blisters is called Chickenpox. Chickenpox is a highly contagious illness, typically affecting children but can also occur in adults who have never contracted the disease before. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is a member of the herpesvirus family. Transmission of chickenpox occurs mainly through respiratory droplets from an infected person's coughs or sneezes, as well as direct contact with the fluid from the broken blisters. The disease usually starts with a mild fever, fatigue, and overall discomfort, followed by the signature itchy rash and fluid-filled blisters. The blisters can appear on any part of the body, including the face, limbs, and even in the mouth or on the genitals. The rash usually progresses through three stages: red bumps (papules), fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), and scabs. These stages can occur simultaneously on different parts of the body. The blisters may be painful or unbearably itchy, but it is crucial not to scratch them, as this can cause secondary bacterial infections or scarring. Once a person has been infected with chickenpox, they will develop immunity to the disease. However, the virus can remain dormant in the body and reactivate later in life, causing a painful condition called shingles. Shingles is characterized by a localized rash, often accompanied by nerve pain, and can occur in individuals who had chickenpox earlier in their life. For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that resolves on its own within one to two weeks. However, for some individuals, complications can occur, such as bacterial infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain), or, more rarely, Reye's syndrome (a severe and potentially life-threatening disorder associated with aspirin use during viral illnesses in children). Treatment for chickenpox primarily involves managing symptoms and providing relief through over-the-counter medications like antihistamines for itchiness, pain relievers for fever, and calamine lotion for the skin. Medical interventions may be necessary if complications are suspected or in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women, newborns, and individuals with compromised immune systems. To prevent chickenpox, a vaccine is available and is typically administered in a two-dose schedule during childhood. The vaccine provides long-lasting protection against the disease, with studies showing that 9 out of 10 people who receive both doses will be protected from chickenpox. Apart from vaccination, practicing good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with infected individuals, helps reduce the spread of the virus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

By 1763, the war in Central Europe was essentially a stalemate. Frederick had retaken most of Silesia and Saxony but not the latter's capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that a new offensive was perhaps impossible. British subsidies had been stopped by the new Prime Minister Lord Bute, and the Russian Emperor had been overthrown by his wife, Catherine, who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, something which greatly affected its offensive power. Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray. By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the Treaty of Hubertusburg, ending the war in central Europe. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In 1763 what was the status of Austria?","completion":"In 1763, the status of Austria was that of a war-weary and financially strained nation. Despite being one of the major powers in Europe, the country was facing significant challenges due to its participation in the ongoing war. Austria had been involved in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), primarily fighting against Prussia in a bid to regain the territories it had lost earlier, particularly Silesia, which was a valuable and prosperous region. Despite some military successes, Austria had not achieved a decisive victory over Prussia. They still held onto some territories such as Dresden, southeastern parts of Saxony, the county of Glatz, and southern Silesia, but the prospect of achieving a complete victory had become dim, especially after the withdrawal of Russia as their ally. The continual war efforts had taken a considerable toll on Austria's economy and resources. The nation was facing a severe financial crisis, which forced them to reduce the size of their army, thus affecting their offensive power. The Austrian administration was in disarray, and the capability to sustain the war had significantly diminished. In this context, Austria was actively seeking a way to end the conflict and secure favorable terms in the peace agreement. The Treaty of Hubertusburg, signed in 1763, eventually brought an end to the war in central Europe, but it did not result in major territorial gains for Austria. The treaty reaffirmed the status quo ante bellum (the situation before the war) with Silesia remaining under Prussian control. Thus, the status of Austria in 1763 can be described as a war-weary nation with financial difficulties, struggling administration, and reduced military power. The end of the Seven Years' War did not significantly alter the Austrian position in Europe but allowed the nation to focus on internal matters and restore stability in the aftermath of the conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Emma V. Lee married Robert Kelley in 1893 . 2. In 1893 , Emma V. Lee Robert Kelley married . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, as they convey the same meaning using slightly different structures and word orders. 1. Emma V. Lee married Robert Kelley in 1893. 2. In 1893, Emma V. Lee Robert Kelley married. Both sentences describe the same event—Emma V. Lee's marriage to Robert Kelley—and the same time frame, 1893. However, the sentence structures differ in terms of how the information is presented. In the first sentence, the subject-verb-object (SVO) sentence structure is utilized, beginning with Emma V. Lee and followed by the action (married) and the object (Robert Kelley). Lastly, the adverbial phrase \\"in 1893\\" provides the contextual information regarding the time of the event. This structure is the most common and easy to understand format in English. In the second sentence, the adverbial phrase \\"In 1893\\" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, emphasizing the time frame of the event. Following this, the subject (Emma V. Lee) and the object (Robert Kelley) are placed next to each other, while the verb (married) is placed at the end. This alternative structure still communicates the same message, but it might be considered slightly less conventional or typical. In summary, despite the contrasting sentence structures, both options ultimately convey the same information and can be considered paraphrased versions of each other.

Write highlights for this article: A copy of the letter which was sent be Dennis Giemsch seeking the addresses of Jews in town. A neo-Nazi party has demanded to know where all Jews in the city of Dortmund live in a chilling echo of the build-up to the Holocaust. Die Rechte – The Right – wrote to mayor Ullrich Sierau through one of its councillors, Dennis Giemsch, seeking to know how many Jews live in and around the town, and their addresses. He asked that the information be supplied at a meeting of the council in the town hall on Wednesday night. The demand was refused and the letter has been passed to the interior ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which is looking at ways to legally ban the party. Full-time computer student Giemsch said the information was 'relevant for our political work'. Die Rechte is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. The echoes of the terror that was unleashed on Jews after Hitler came to power in 1933 is not lost on Jews everywhere in Germany because the Holocaust of six million began with their registration, their numbers and where they lived. Die Rechte has been under the watchful eye of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the domestic intelligence service, since it was founded two years ago from the rump of an old neo-Nazi party. It is the smallest of the far-right groups in the country but its numbers are growing, particularly among the young. In the party programme it swears to protect the 'German identity,' ban English words in advertising, 'protect' German culture, limit immigration, kick out foreigners convicted of crimes, support 'German' families to have 'German' children, widen police powers of arrest and protect animals. Most of their manifesto can be found in a similar form from that of Hitler's National Socialists back in the 1920's. Jewish people in Dortmund have reacted with alarm to the demand of the party to know where they reside and how many of them there are. One told a local newspaper: 'This is how it all began before. I don't think it will come to that again but such things evoke terrible memories. I hope this will be used by the authorities as a building block in future legislation to ban them.'

A child prodigy, he began drawing at age two; by the time he was ten, his work was displayed in local art shows. His first efforts in animation included a series of flip books that he produced in his school text books. As a child, Povenmire considered animator Chuck Jones his hero; in a 2009 interview, he stated that \\"every drawing he [Jones] did was beautiful to look at and had so much energy in it\\". In 1993, Povenmire and Marsh conceived the series Phineas and Ferb, based on their similar experiences of childhood summers spent outdoors. Povenmire spent 14-16 years pitching Phineas and Ferb to several networks. Most rejected it as unfeasible for the complexity of its plots, but Povenmire persevered, later observing \\"It was really the show we wanted to see: if this was on the air, I'd watch it, and I don't always feel that about every show I work on.\\" Even the Walt Disney Company initially rejected Povenmire's pitch, but asked to keep the proposal packet: \\"Usually that means they throw it in the trash later,\\" Povenmire recalled. Eventually Disney called Povenmire back with an acceptance, on the condition that he would produce an 11-minute pilot. He called Marsh, who was living in England, to ask him if he would like to work on the pilot; Marsh accepted immediately and moved back to the United States. Instead of a conventional script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series. Povenmire and Marsh wanted to incorporate into Phineas and Ferb the kind of humor they had developed in their work on Rocko's Modern Life. They included action sequences and, with Disney's encouragement, featured musical numbers in every episode subsequent to \\"Flop Starz\\". Povenmire described the songs as his and Marsh's \\"jab at immortality\\", but the pair have earned two Emmy nominations for Phineas and Ferb songs to-date. A third Emmy nomination, for the episode \\"The Monster of Phineas-n-Ferbenstein\\" (2008), pitted the show against SpongeBob SquarePants, although neither nominee received the award due to a technicality. In 2010, Povenmire was nominated amongst several other Phineas and Ferb crew members for the Daytime Emmy Award for both \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\" and \\"Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation\\" for their work on the show, winning for \\"Outstanding Writing in Animation\\". The distinctive style of the animation legend Tex Avery influenced the show's artistic look. Like Avery, Povermire employed geometric shapes to build both the characters and the background. The style developed almost accidentally, with Povenmire's first sketch of title character, Phineas Flynn, which he produced while eating dinner with his family in a restaurant in South Pasadena, California. He doodled a triangle-shaped child on the butcher paper covering the table. He was so taken with sketch he tore it out, kept it, and used it as the prototype for Phineas and as the stylistic blueprint for the entire show.

You are presented with the quiz \\"recycling reduces what when making something?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"recycling reduces the resources needed to make something\\" and \\"recycling saves resources and reduces pollution\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Options: + fossil fuels + pollution + Energy. + less water + power + energy + Heat energy + deforestation","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"recycling reduces what when making something?\\" would be a combination of options: 1. Energy (also referred to as \\"power\\") 2. Pollution 3. Fossil fuels 4. Deforestation To elaborate further, recycling can reduce the demand for new raw materials, thereby limiting deforestation by decreasing the need to extract timber and other resources from the forests. By reducing the extraction of raw materials, recycling helps to preserve natural habitats and maintain overall environmental balance. In addition, recycling can save energy. When manufacturing companies utilize recycled materials instead of utilizing virgin raw materials, the energy used during the production process is often decreased. This is because recycling can minimize the need to refine and process new resources, which are often energy-intensive procedures. As a result, power and energy consumption are significantly reduced. Moreover, through the process of recycling, we conserve fossil fuels as well. Since fewer raw materials need to be extracted, transported, and processed, there is a decrease in the utilization of fossil fuels required to power machinery and vehicles involved in these activities. Lastly, recycling helps reduce pollution, which can be in the form of air, soil, and water pollution. Reducing the need to manufacture new materials from virgin sources can lessen the amount of pollutants and greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Furthermore, recycling can reduce pollution by diverting waste away from landfills and incineration facilities, which can also cause pollution. Overall, the recycling process plays a crucial role in preserving natural resources and reducing environmental impact for a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, both options have their own merits, which will be discussed in detail below. Option 1: Doing extensive research and reading online reviews before booking anything Advantages: 1. Informed decision-making: By conducting thorough research, you can gather a wealth of information about various vacation destinations, accommodations, and activities, thereby ensuring that you make a more informed choice for your vacation plans. 2. Trustworthy feedback: Reading online reviews from other travelers provides insights into their personal experiences, which can help you assess how well a particular destination or establishment aligns with your preferences and expectations. 3. Time and cost-efficient: Researching and reading reviews help you identify potential issues before committing to a booking, saving you the hassle of last-minute changes, or finding yourself in undesirable situations. 4. Improved decision accuracy: Combining your extensive research with the collective wisdom of online reviewers can boost your chances of making the best possible choice for your vacation. 5. Customized itinerary: Your research allows you to not only make the best choice but also create a tailored itinerary catering to your interests, thereby ensuring a more enjoyable and fulfilling vacation experience. Option 2: Doing extensive research and writing online reviews before booking anything Advantages: 1. Sharing your findings: By writing online reviews based on your research findings, you can help other travelers make better decisions for their own vacation plans. This can provide a sense of satisfaction and contribution to the travel community. 2. Developing a reputation: As you write online reviews, you can also develop a reputation for providing valuable insights into various vacation destinations and establishments, which may lead to opportunities for collaboration with the travel industry, such as sponsored trips or affiliations. However, there are some caveats with Option 2 that should be considered: 1. Limited personal experience: Writing online reviews based solely on research without having firsthand experience in those destinations may lead to providing incomplete or inaccurate information to others. 2. Time-consuming: Writing online reviews on top of extensive research can be time-consuming, and the benefits might not directly contribute to achieving your goal of making the best choice for your vacation. In conclusion, doing extensive research and reading online reviews before booking anything (Option 1) would be the more appropriate course of action to make the best choice for your vacation. Not only does it provide a wealth of information for informed decision-making, it also allows you to consider the experiences of others, save time and money, and create a customized itinerary catering to your preferences. Although writing online reviews can be helpful to the travel community, its constraints and potential drawbacks make it a less effective strategy for making the best choice of where to vacation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It is common for older people to forget things. Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds.

And I was wondering How would Jordan feel afterwards?","completion":"Jordan's feelings after sleeping through their alarm and running late for school may range from a mix of emotions such as anxiety, frustration, embarrassment, and guilt. These emotions could be experienced in varying degrees depending on Jordan's personality, experiences, and expectations. Here is a more detailed description of how these emotions might manifest and influence Jordan's actions and thoughts: 1. Anxiety: Jordan could experience a surge of anxiety as they realize they have overslept and are running late for school. This emotion could cause Jordan to feel panicky and overwhelmed. Consequently, this anxiety might lead them to rush through their morning routine, possibly skipping breakfast or leaving essential belongings behind. Jordan may also worry about how their tardiness may impact their academic performance, such as missing important information during a class or incurring penalties for late attendance. 2. Frustration: Realizing they have slept through their alarm, Jordan might feel a sense of frustration with themselves, as well as with external factors that may have contributed to this situation. For example, they could be frustrated that their alarm was not loud enough or at their decision to stay up late the night before. This frustration might cause Jordan to feel irritable and on edge, potentially leading to conflicts with family members or friends during this chaotic morning. 3. Embarrassment: Jordan might feel embarrassed about their late arrival, especially if tardiness is not a common occurrence for them. The anticipation of arriving at school and facing their classmates or teachers could make Jordan feel self-conscious and concerned about their reputation. This embarrassment may lead them to take actions to minimize or mask their lateness, such as attempting to sneak into class, making up excuses for their tardiness, or avoiding eye contact with peers and teachers. 4. Guilt: It's not uncommon for individuals to feel guilty about letting themselves or others down, and Jordan may experience this emotion upon being late for school. They might feel guilty for wasting their parent's time if they have to drop them off at school or for letting their friends down by not being there on time. Jordan might also feel guilty if their tardiness affects the group's progress in a collaborative project or if their teacher has to take time to catch them up on the material. This guilt may lead them to apologize profusely, make efforts to compensate for the lost time, or try to improve their tardiness in the future. Overall, Jordan's emotions upon being late for school could significantly impact their actions, thoughts, and interactions with others. It is essential for Jordan to recognize and process these feelings healthily, communicate their emotions to others when appropriate, and put effective strategies in place to prevent future incidents of sleeping through their alarm. This could involve establishing a more regular sleep routine, finding more effective methods to wake up, and having contingency plans in place for those days when things don't go as planned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Fearless villagers in South Africa have been filmed wrestling with deadly Nile crocodiles in a bid to catch as many as possible after 15,000 escaped from a farm. The reptiles, which can grow to 16ft long, were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby Limpopo river flood last weekend. Bosses at the Rakwena Crocodile Farm in the north-east of the country opened the gates to the animals’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Brave: Three men pin down a crocodile so they can tie its claws and jaws with plastic ties. Caught: At least 2,000 of the crocodiles are believed to have been recaptured since they escaped last weekend. Danger: Nile crocodiles are meat eaters and have been known to attack humans. The reptiles have since been spotted. all over the local area – including on a school sports field – and. wildlife experts urged local people to avoid the animals and stay. indoors. As the flood waters fell, many have been found trapped in the branches of trees. The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodile in Africa and the second-largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile. Prey consists of gazelles, antelope, waterbuck, sitatunga, lechwe, wildebeest, zebras, warthogs, giraffes and Cape buffalos. They are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens, goats, sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans. Males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old, mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more. They are found in Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, Tanzania, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, South Africa, Malawi, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar and in Senegal. But as this incredible footage shows, many residents showed no fear in tackling the crocodiles themselves. At least 2,000 had been caught by Friday according to South Africa's Afrikaans language Beeld newspaper. Police have been leading the hunt which has mainly taken place at night because their eyes reflect in the torchlight and they are easier to find. The video shows locals pinning the crocodiles to the ground and then handcuffing them with plastic ties. Earlier this week, the crocodile farm's boss Zane Langman told the Beeld that he has been recapturing the animals whenever he is alerted to one. He said he had already caught 'a few. thousand' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm, but he. told the newspaper that 'more than half' of his reptiles are still. missing. Commercial. crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin, which is used to make. crocodile leather for items such as belts, shoes and handbags. There is also a small market for. crocodile meat, but most often the dead reptile's is fed to other crocs. as the species is cannibalistic. The. commercial crocodile farming industry is small, but growing, in South. Africa, where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around. 500,000 animals. Because the quality of the skin is. paramount, some farms keep each crocodile in its own, battery-style pen. so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals. However this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens. Nile. Crocodiles are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long. They. can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph. They. are extremely dangerous to humans. Their preferred method of killing is. to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it, alive,. underwater to drown it. Blunder: The crocodiles were accidentally released after farmers tried to release excess flood water from their pens. An estimated 15,000 crocodiles have escaped from the Rakmena Farm in South Africa where they are bred for their skin which is used in handbags, belts and shoes.

If you have a room that has long walls paired with shorter walls, creating a narrow space, it's best to create your focal point for the room on the long wall. If you try to place it on the narrower wall, the room will look even bigger than it already does. Available choices: --For example, if you have a small room, such as a bedroom, use your walls as a focal point. If your bedroom has an entrance into the center, use that to make your room look larger. --A focal point can be an entertainment center or it can be a large piece like a painting. Basically, it's what the attention is focused on in your space. --Use a piece of furniture to create a focal point on either side. For instance, a simple couch looks great on this wall, and a large, deep rug looks great on your dining table, for instance. --Try to create focal points that create at least 1 vertical , 1 horizontal, and 1 vertical vision of the room. Fix your focal points to one piece of the wall.","completion":"Start by assessing the space and determining the look you want to achieve. Consider the style and color scheme of the rest of your home to ensure that your hallway or long wall decoration complements the overall design. Once you have a vision, follow these steps to decorate your long wall or hallway: 1. Plan your layout: Sketch the wall or hallway on paper with measurements and create a rough layout of where your focal point and other decor pieces will go. Consider symmetry and balance when planning the layout. 2. Choose the artwork or decorative elements: Select one or more large pieces of artwork, a mirror, or a patterned wallpaper to serve as a main focal point. If you prefer a gallery wall, use a mix of framed photos, paintings, prints, and other wall decor items in different sizes and shapes, keeping in mind the overall color scheme. 3. Add lighting: Proper lighting can enhance the ambiance and make the space more inviting. Track lighting, wall sconces, or floor lamps can all work well to illuminate and showcase your focal point and other decor elements. 4. Incorporate storage: If your hallway or long wall is part of a functional space like a living area or a bedroom, consider adding shelves or built-in storage to keep the area organized and visually appealing. 5. Mix and match textures and materials: Combine various textures and materials such as wood, metal, fabric, and glass to add interest and depth to your space. 6. Hang your decor: Start with your focal point and work outwards, hanging your artwork or decorative pieces on the wall. Use appropriate hardware and tools for a secure installation, and be sure to hang items at eye level or slightly lower to create a more intimate feel. 7. Create a sense of flow: Use accent colors and repeating patterns in your decor to guide the eye down the hall or along the long wall, creating a sense of movement and flow. 8. Incorporate various heights: To create visual interest, consider installing floating shelves or wall-mounted storage at different heights. This will help to break up the long expanse of the wall while also providing functionality. 9. Accessorize: Complete your design with accessories that complement your focal point and overall style. Examples include decorative objects, small sculptures, or potted plants on shelves, or a unique runner rug in the hallway. 10. Reevaluate and adjust: Once you have decorated your long wall or hallway, step back and assess the overall look. Make adjustments as needed, whether it's moving a piece here or there, adding more elements, or removing some that aren't working. By following these steps, your long wall or hallway will become a visually engaging and functional space that adds character to your home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to?

Given the below context: Nicolas Rolin was appointed Chancellor of Burgundy by Philip the Good in 1422, a position he held for the next 33 years. His tenure with the duke made him a wealthy man, and he donated a large portion of his fortune for the foundation of the Hôtel-Dieu in Beaune. It is not known why he decided to build in Beaune rather than in his birthplace of Autun. He may have chosen Beaune because it lacked a hospital and an outbreak of the plague decimated the population between 1438 and 1440. Furthermore, when in 1435 the Treaty of Arras failed to bring a cessation to the longstanding hostility and animosity between Burgundy and France, the town suffered brutal ravages and famine from écorcheurs (marauding bands) who roamed the countryside during the late 1430s and early 1440s. The hospice was built after Rolin gained permission from Pope Eugene IV in 1441, and it was eventually consecrated on 31 December 1452. In conjunction, Rolin established the religious order of \\"Les sœurs hospitalières de Beaune\\". Rolin dedicated the hospice to St Anthony Abbot, who was commonly associated with sickness and healing during the Middle Ages. In the hospice's founding charter, signed in August 1443, Rolin wrote that \\"disregarding all human concerns and in the interest of my salvation, desiring by a favourable trade to exchange for celestial goods temporal ones, that I might from divine goodness render those goods which are perishable for ones which are eternal ... in gratitude for the goods which the Lord, source of all wealth, has heaped upon me, from now on and for always, I found a hospital.\\" In the late 1450s, only a few years before he died, he added a provision to the hospital charter stipulating that the Mass for the Dead be offered twice daily. Rolin's wife, Guigone de Salins, played a major role in the foundation, as probably did his nephew Jan Rolin. De Salins lived and served at the hospice until her own death in 1470.Documents regarding the artwork's commissioning survive and, unusually for a Netherlandish altarpiece,...
