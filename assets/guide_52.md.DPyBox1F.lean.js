The Master","completion":"Title: \\"The Master’s Pull\\" Plot: In the year 2050, the SS Virtuous, a state-of-the-art spacecraft crewed by a team of interstellar scientists and astronauts, goes on an ambitious deep-space expedition to the farthest borders of the known universe. From Earth, the crew's mission is to find and collect particles of a unique energy source believed to exist only in uncharted space. The crew is made up of Captain Robert Hanley, an experienced astronaut, Dr. Ava Rhodes, a physicist, biologist Dr. Oliver Gibson, and communications officer Lilly Chen. One day, the ship's sensors pick up an unusual energy reading from an uncharted planet, something that matches the anticipated signature of the energy source they were sent to collect. They decide to investigate and land on the planet. But as they explore the alien world, they are hit by a massive gravitational force that they can't explain. The force, which they refer to as \\"The Master,\\" pulls everything towards it with increasing intensity, forcing the crew to leave hastily. Back on the ship, they discover that the Master's pull is getting stronger and drawing the SS Virtuous towards the planet. The crew struggles to escape its gravitational pull, battling against the fuel depleting rapidly and systems failing progressively. Meanwhile, on Earth, the mission controllers lose contact with the SS Virtuous and fear the worst for their crew. However, a rogue scientist, Dr. Sarah Turner, believes there's a way to save them. On the SS Virtuous, the situation is increasingly dire, and Captain Hanley makes a brave decision. He chooses to dive the ship at full speed towards the Master in a risky maneuver hoping to use the planet’s own gravity to create a slingshot effect which could catapult them back into space. Dr. Rhodes, however,fears that the intense gravitational pull might destroy the ship in the process. Then she remembers an experimental propulsion system she had been working on. This new system was not fully tested but expected to yield a stronger thrust than their current engines. In a desperate attempt, Dr. Rhodes and others implement this new propulsion system onto the ship. Back on Earth, Dr. Turner is able to tap into the SS Virtuous's weak signal and manages to guide the crew on how to stabilize the energy field around the ship using the gravitation particle they've collected on the planet, shielding them from the most devastating effects of the Master's pull. With one final surge of power, the captain maneuvers the SS Virt, and in combination with their new propulsion system, they rocket away from the Master's pull, leaving the deadly force behind. Their unconventional exit catapults them through space, and they find themselves right back at Earth faster than anticipated due to a miraculous bend in space-time. The movie ends with a relieved and joyous celebration at the control center as the ship and its crew make a triumphant return to Earth. This victorious return is immediately followed by a grave realization: their exploration and escape from the Master have led to an unprecedented discovery—wormhole travel. The mystery of the Master unraveled a new era for space travel, endowing humanity with the unexpected gift of exploring farthest reaches of the universe. Thus, \\"The Master's Pull\\" becomes a legacy of the bravest crew in the annals of Human Civilization, with a tale of courage, survival, and mind-bending scientific enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","completion":"especially well known is this admiral's uniform, which was one of the king's favorites, and which he often wore. In this sentence, the context appears to describe a particular admiral's uniform that gained significant recognition due to its association with a king. This uniform was favored by the king, who frequently wore it, adding to its notoriety. The connection between the uniform, the admiral, and the king made it a highly valued and unique piece in historical context. It might have become a symbol of prestige, power, or even national pride due to its connection with the king. Moreover, the uniform was likely designed with specific embellishments, patterns, or colors that made it stand out from other standard military uniforms. These distinctive features allowed it to gain recognition and make it easier to associate with the king and the admiral it originally belonged to. As the king continuously wore the admiral's uniform, it became a significant symbol of his preference, respect, or admiration for the admiral in question, suggesting a close relationship between the two individuals. Additionally, it is probable that the admiral's achievements and contributions to the kingdom were highly respected and admired. The uniform served as a reminder of these accomplishments, making it an essential part of the kingdom's cultural and military history. Both the king and the public could look at the uniform and remember the admiral's valor, strategic prowess, or other attributes which had proven beneficial to their nation. Furthermore, the popularity and importance of this admiral's uniform could have reached beyond the borders of the kingdom, as neighboring kingdoms took notice of the king's preferences and the distinct attire. Such admiration and influence may have led to other nations adopting similar uniforms or design elements to pay tribute or express their respect towards the mentioned admiral or the king. In conclusion, the renown of this admiral's uniform lies in its close association with the king who held it in high esteem, frequently wearing it. The uniform became an emblem of prestige, power, and national pride thanks to its distinctive design and representation of a notable admiral's accomplishments. The king's preference for the uniform likely strengthened the connection between the royal court and the military, while its renown and influence possibly spread beyond their kingdom, further enhancing its historical significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Answer the following question: Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya?","completion":"Based on the given background information, Tanzania would likely have a thinner A horizon compared to Kenya. Step 1: Understand the differences in organic matter contribution - In grasslands, the main source of organic matter is the deep, fibrous grass root systems. - In forests, the main source of organic matter is tree leaves falling on the forest floor. Step 2: Consider the impact of fires and soil organisms - Fires are common in grasslands, destroying aboveground material but stimulating greater contributions from roots. - The greater acidity in forests inhibits certain soil organisms, preventing the mixing of surface litter into the mineral soil. Step 3: Analyze the soil structure in grasslands and forests - Grasslands typically have a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter. - Forests characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and a thin A horizon. Step 4: Apply the information to the Kenya-Tanzania border - The Kenyan grassland gradually merges into the Tanzanian forest. - Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grasslands in Africa, while Tanzania has one of the largest forest covers in Africa. Step 5: Compare A horizons for Kenya and Tanzania - As grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon, Kenya, with its extensive grasslands, would have a thicker A horizon. - Conversely, Tanzania, with its vast forest cover, would have a thinner A horizon due to greater O horizon accumulation and less efficient mixing of organic matter into the mineral soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The massage itself often focuses on stimulating energy centers, or chakras, in the body, which can lead to a sense of invigoration and spiritual awakening. The experience of having a tantric massage can vary depending on the individual's preferences and the practitioner's specific techniques. In general, it is a deeply relaxing experience, which helps to release emotional and physical tension. Some people may experience heightened sensations or even euphoric states during the massage. 2.

Each practitioner may have their own unique approach and menu of services, but overall, they aim to provide an authentic and rejuvenating tantric massage experience for their clients. If the question is about a specific establishment or provider called \\"Tantric Massage London\\": In this context, \\"Tantric Massage London\\" would be the name of a business that offers tantric massage services to clients in London. To understand more about this particular provider, you could search their name along with keywords like \\"reviews,\\" \\"services,\\" and \\"pricing\\" to determine their reputation, what types of massages they offer, and the costs associated with their offerings. It's essential to choose a reputable and professional massage provider to ensure a positive and effective tantric massage experience.

The rising stars had proven to their manager, and the watching world, that they deserved their spots in the starting lineup. And so, the story ends with a triumphant return to North London for Kane, Townsend, and the entire Tottenham squad. Their victory in the Theodoros Kolokotronis Stadium marked a turning point in their season, as they gained newfound confidence and belief from their impressive performances in the Europa League. Upon arriving back in England, Pochettino made it clear that both players had earned more regular slots in the first team, and they went on to have successful seasons for the Spurs. Kane continued to establish himself as one of Europe's deadliest strikers, while Townsend's pace and skill caused numerous headaches for Premier League defenses. As the years went on, the pair developed into key figures in the Tottenham Hotspur side, guiding their team domestically and in continental competitions. Ultimately, their careers reached new heights with significant contributions at international level for England. As their careers progressed, they both became instrumental figures in their respective clubs and on the international stage. And so the story comes to a close, with Kane and Townsend having seized the opportunities presented to them on that fateful night in Greece. The attacking duo carved impressive careers for themselves, both at a club and international level, earning their place in the pantheon of English footballing heroes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: The defenses dominated the first three drives of the game, all ending in punts. But midway through the first quarter, Malcom Brown and Patrick Chung shared a tackle of Kenneth Dixon in the end zone for a safety(the third by the Patriots' defense on the season). The Ravens forced the Patriots to punt, and, aided by a 40-yard gain from Joe Flacco to Kyle Juszczyk and a 15-yard pass interference penalty on Cyrus Jones, drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Shea McClellin blocked Justin Tucker's field goal attempt. Following that, the Patriots covering 74 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, his 14th, which tied him with Curtis Martin who had 14 for the 1995 New England Patriots. The Ravens reached Patriot territory on their following possession, too, but punted again. Aided by a 61-yard completion to White, the Patriots raced 89 yards in just eight plays with Brady finding Mitchell on a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the lead to 16-0. On the second plays of the Ravens next drive, McCourty intercepted Flacco at the Patriots 22 and returned it 40 yards to the Ravens 38, but official review ruled him down by contact at the Patriots 23. Despite this, the Patriots reached the Ravens 1-yard line, but Eric Weddle intercepted Brady(only his second interception of the season) and returned it 14 yards to the Ravens 10. Two possessions later, after Devin Hester returned a punt 12 yards to the Ravens 28, the Ravens reached the Patriots 28 and got on board with a 50-yard Tucker field goal with 0:11 seconds left in the half, making the score 16-3 at halftime. After forcing the Ravens to punt on the initial drive of the third quarter, the Patriots marched 65 yards to score on Brady's 19-yard pass to Bennett, increasing the lead to 23-3. A 6-yard run by Blount on the drive game him 1,005 yards for the season. However, the Ravens got back in the game with aide from the Patriots. While the Ravens offense continued it's ineptitude, Cyrus Jones muffed a punt with Chris Moore recovering at the Patriots 3. Two plays later, Flacco connected with Darren Waller for a two-yard touchdown pass, trimning the deficit to 23-10. Things got better for the Ravens with Matthew Slater fumbling the kick return and Shareece Wright recovering at the Patriots 22-yard line. Four plays later, Dixon caught a swing pass for an 8-yard touchdown, and all of a sudden the score was 23-17. After three consecutive punts, the Ravens, aided by a 47-yard catch by Breshad Perriman, reached the Patriots 12, but on 3rd-and-4 Flacco was sacked by Ninkovich for an 8-yard loss. Tucker finished the drive with a 38-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 23-20 with 6:35 remaining in the game. On the first play of the Patriots next drive, Brady found Chris Hogan wide open for a 79-yard touchdown, extending the Patriots lead to 30-20. That was Brady's 450th career touchdown pass and only Hogan's second career 100-yard receiving game. Yet, the Ravens were still in the game, driving to the Patriots 20-yard line, Tucker hit a 37-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 30-23 and giving the Ravens a chance. On the Patriots next drive, the Ravens brought the game to a 4th-and-1 with 0:13 remaining. Instead of punting, the Patriots went for the kill shot and got it with Blount's 3-yard run enabling the Patriots to run out the clock and end the game. The Patriots improved to 11-2 and dropped 496 yards of total offense and 30 points on the Ravens' top-ranked defense, both the most allowed in the season by the Ravens. The Patriots posted their 10th all-time franchise victory against the Ravens. This was Brady's 100th career home win and his 9th 400+ yard passing game of his career and his second of the season.

Context: I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there’s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

He was also briefly a member of the UK Subs in 1991. He joined Rancid in 1993 after the band was searching for a second guitar player and was present on their second album \\"Let's Go\\". He has produced albums for bands such as Agnostic Front, The Business, Dropkick Murphys, Swingin Utters, Marky Ramone and the Intruders, Anti-Heros, Patriot, The Forgotten, Harrington Saints, and Pressure Point. He recently mixed Charged GBH's new album entitled \\"Perfume and Piss\\", as well as Cock Sparrer's album \\"Here We Stand\\" both alongside Michael Rosen. - The Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1996. The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the label, and making a name for themselves locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held in and around Boston. The 2004 single \\"Tessie\\" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest charting singles to date. The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's \\"The Warrior's Code\\", included the song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"; the song was featured in the 2006 Academy Award-winning movie \\"The Departed\\", and went on to become the band's only Platinum-selling single to date, and remains one of their best-known songs.

GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \\"UK82\\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources. - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement.

Although they have never enjoyed commercial success, they are considered one of the most influential street punk bands of all time, helping pave the way for early 80's punk scene and the Oi! subgenre. Their songs have been covered by many punk, Oi!, and hardcore bands. - Viking is the second and final studio album by the American punk rock band Lars Frederiksen and the Bastards . - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Anti-Heros were an American Oi!/street punk band formed in 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States.

Choices: - cultures - tropics - zones - epochs A: Answer:","completion":"The geologic time scale is a system that organizes Earth's history based on major events, changes, and developments that happened throughout time. It is divided into four main levels of classification: eons, eras, periods, and epochs. The correct choice among the given options is epochs. 1. Eons: Eons are the largest intervals of geologic time, spanning hundreds to thousands of millions of years. There are four eons recognized in Earth's history: the Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic and Phanerozoic: a. Hadean: This eon covers the time from Earth's formation (approximately 4.6 billion years ago) until around 4 billion years ago. The Earth was still cooling and solidifying during this time, and there was no life yet. b. Archean: This eon spans from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago. During the Archean, the Earth's crust was forming and stabilizing, and the earliest forms of life started to appear, such as single-celled organisms known as prokaryotes. c. Proterozoic: The Proterozoic eon covers the time from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago. During this eon, eukaryotes, more complex single-celled organisms, evolved, and significant amounts of oxygen were released through photosynthesis. d. Phanerozoic: This eon started about 541 million years ago and continues through the present day. It is characterized by the rapid evolution of multicellular life forms and the development of complex ecosystems. 2. Eras: Eras are the next level down in the geologic time scale, and each eon is divided into several eras. For example, the Phanerozoic eon is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. 3. Periods: Each era is further divided into periods, which generally range from tens to hundreds of millions of years. For instance, the Mesozoic era has three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. 4. Epochs: Epochs are the smallest divisions of geologic time, usually lasting a few million years. Each period is divided into several epochs. For example, the Cenozoic era's current period, the Quaternary, is divided into two epochs: the Holocene (the current epoch) and the Pleistocene. In summary, the geologic time scale is a hierarchical system that classifies Earth's history into eons, eras, periods, and epochs. This organization helps geologists and other scientists better understand and describe the various events and changes that have occurred throughout our planet's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Context: Looking to snap a four-game losing streak, the 1-8 Browns flew to Ford Field for a Week 11 interconference duel with the 1-8 Detroit Lions. Both teams began the game with field goals, as Cleveland kicker Phil Dawson made a 44-yard field goal while Lions kicker Jason Hanson got a 31-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback Brady Quinn completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi, a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chansi Stuckey, and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback Matthew Stafford completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back Aaron Brown. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back Kevin Smith on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, Cleveland would end the half with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal. Detroit would take the lead in the third quarter with Stafford's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Will Heller, the Browns would pick up a safety after Stafford was called for intentional grounding from his own end zone. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland regained the lead with Quinn's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Gaines (followed by running back Jamal Lewis getting a 2-point conversion run). The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety Brodney Pool intercepted the ball. However, cornerback Hank Poteat was flagged for pass interference in the end zone. Since the game cannot end on a defensive penalty, Detroit was given one un-timed down from the Browns' 1-yard line and Stafford completed the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end Brandon Pettigrew. With the loss in the 1-8 battle, Cleveland fell to 1-9 assuring them that they would finish last in their division. Question: How many yards of touchdowns were scored in the first half? Answer:","completion":"In the first half, there were a total of 6 touchdowns, with the following yardages: 59, 40, 4, 26, 25, and 75 yards.

Please answer this question: second nearest star to the earth after sun?","completion":"The second nearest star system to Earth after the Sun is the Alpha Centauri system, which is located at a distance of approximately 4.37 light years from us. This star system is actually a triple star system consisting of three stars: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. When considering individual stars, the second nearest star to Earth after the Sun is Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star and is at a distance of about 4.24 light years from our solar system. This star is also part of the aforementioned Alpha Centauri star system. Proxima Centauri is a smaller and much cooler star compared to the Sun, with a mass of only about 12% of the Sun's mass and a diameter just 14% of the Sun's diameter. Its surface temperature is only about 3,042 Kelvin, which is cooler than the Sun's 5,500 Kelvin. Since Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star, it has a much lower brightness than the Sun, which makes it difficult to spot with the naked eye from Earth. In fact, it cannot be seen with the naked eye and requires a telescope for observation. Due to its proximity to Earth, Proxima Centauri has been a subject of interest for astronomers and researchers, particularly in the search for exoplanets within its habitable zone. In 2016, an exoplanet named Proxima Centauri b was discovered orbiting this red dwarf star. This discovery generated a lot of excitement because Proxima Centauri b is within the star's habitable zone, meaning that it has the potential to harbor liquid water and possibly even life. The planet is roughly Earth-sized, with a mass about 1.17 times that of Earth, and it takes around 11.2 Earth days to orbit Proxima Centauri. Scientists continue to study Proxima Centauri and its exoplanets, as they provide a significant opportunity for us to learn more about nearby star systems and potential habitable worlds. Furthermore, due to the relatively close distance to Earth, the Alpha Centauri system, and Proxima Centauri in particular, are considered as prime targets for future interstellar missions aimed at exploring the galaxy and searching for life beyond our solar system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: BALTIMORE (WJZ) — A man claiming to have a bomb strapped to his chest threatened a Baltimore TV station Thursday afternoon, and was later shot by police after walking out of the building. At around 10:30 p.m. WJZ spoke with a man who identified the suspect as his son, 25-year-old Alex Brizzi. Brizzi is at the hospital receiving treatment, and is in serious condition but expected to survive. The explosive device Brizzi claimed to have when he walked into the Fox 45 building in the Woodberry section of Baltimore around 1:20 p.m. Thursday was actually chocolate candy bars wrapped in wires, with another device meant to look like a detonator running down his sleeve. A security guard with Fox 45 tells WJZ reporter George Solis that Brizzi walked into the station wearing a hedgehog onesie outfit and medical mask, claiming he had a bomb. “He pretty much said he had a bomb on him and that he … had a message that he needed to be heard,” said the security guard. The security guard said the man had a flash drive containing files that had to do with astronomy. “It pretty much had to do with anything with astronomy … black holes, the sun, about it being liquid and gas, and he just wanted to say that the government was wrong in thinking about the way they do when it comes to anything in space,” said the guard. Just after 3 p.m. the suspect walked out of the station, refusing to take his hands out of his pockets, according to Baltimore police. Police spokesperson T.J. Smith says the suspect was then shot at least three times after refusing to cooperate. While on the ground after being shot, a police robot helped the department communicate with the man without getting too close to him, and helped them retrieve the item he had claimed was a bomb, which turned out to be a device made of candy bars, wires, a motherboard from a fire extinguisher and a flotation device. No injuries besides Brizzi’s were reported in relation to the incident. Just before 4:30 p.m. the suspect was taken away in an ambulance. On Thursday night, the ATF searched the suspect’s home in Elkridge for hours. Ed Brizzi told WJZ his son had recently changed his attitude, saying the world was going to end on June 3. “We really didn’t see this coming. This happened so fast. It’s only been a couple of weeks. We were looking at him, trying to assess him, trying to figure out what to do. He’s 25 years old, so I can’t say ‘You’ve got to go into the hospital,'” said Brizzi. Before news of the bomb threat broke, Fox 45 reporter Paul Gessler initially reported a fire in their parking lot. Gessler live streamed the incident on Periscope which showed the vehicle’s gas tank on fire. Police say that the fire is now being investigated as an arson. “Outside of the building a vehicle was set on fire,” said Smith. “It appears to be arson related. There was a rag inside of the gas tank area of the vehicle.

Follow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook ||||| A man wearing a full animal costume and surgical mask walks out of a TV station in Baltimore, Thursday, April 28, 2016. Baltimore police say a department sniper shot the man, who police say walked into... (Associated Press) BALTIMORE (AP) — Criminal charges have been filed against a man shot and wounded by police after walking into a Baltimore TV station wearing an animal costume and a fake bomb, authorities said Friday. Alex Michael Brizzi, 25, of Elkridge, has been charged with arson, malicious burning, threat of arson, reckless endangerment and possessing a phony destructive device, said Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. Davis said Brizzi walked into the vestibule of Baltimore's Fox 45 TV station just before 1:30 p.m. on Thursday wearing a hedgehog costume and a surgical mask \\"associated with Japanese anime culture,\\" with a red vest strapped to his torso. Brizzi left the vestibule about 3 p.m., and refused to comply with officers' commands to put his hands up in the air. Brizzi was shot at least three times by police. He was taken to University of Maryland Shock Trauma and is expected to survive his wounds. Before entering the station, Brizzi set his own car on fire. Davis said a search warrant was executed on both Brizzi's home and his car, and that no explosives or replica explosives were found. He said the event is in no way connected to any type of organized terrorism. Brizzi's father said his son believed the world was ending and might have been trying to get the message out. Edward Brizzi of Elkridge, Maryland, told news outlets after the shooting on Thursday that his son had a breakdown two weeks ago and said he had a vision from God that the world would end next month. His son was shot four times, but is expected to survive, he said. Edward Brizzi said he didn't know why he chose Fox affiliate WBFF-TV on Baltimore's TV hill. \\"I think what it is, he wanted to go to a media outlet so he pass his message on that the world's going to end on June the third,\\" Edward Brizzi said in an interview with the TV station. Alex Brizzi gave a flash drive to a security guard and told him he wanted the station to broadcast its contents. Police later determined that what Brizzi claimed to be a bomb consisted of aluminum-wrapped chocolate bars duct-taped to a flotation device. Smith said police don't know what was on the drive. Police said Alex Brizzi barricaded himself inside the station after it was evacuated and his car became engulfed in flames outside as police, fire, arson, bomb squad and SWAT teams arrived. Police don't know what caused the fire. Brizzi then walked out of the building and into the street, where he ignored heavily armed officers' orders to show his hands. Police shot him and then communicated with him via a bomb-detecting robot. When the Brizzi removed the fake bomb, paramedics rushed to him and put him in an ambulance, Smith said. About two weeks ago, Alex Brizzi broke up with his girlfriend and appeared to have a breakdown, Edward Brizzi told news media outlets. He was found sleeping in a neighbor's yard and it took seven police officers to hold him down as he was taken to a local hospital, he said. Brizzi said his son, who lives in the basement of his home, had been reserved since his breakdown, but he didn't have any way of making a bomb and his father didn't know he was planning anything like this. \\"What he was doing was probably putting himself out there thinking that he wanted to die, I think,\\" he told the station. He said his wife found something with wires in their son's room Wednesday night when Alex Brizzi was out, but they didn't think anything of it, Edward Brizzi said. \\"It just didn't connect,\\" he said. Brizzi said he agrees with how police handled the situation. \\"They've got to do their job; they can't assume it's candy bars wrapped around his side,\\" he said. \\"I'm a firm believer in police.\\" Brizzi said he and his wife couldn't force their son to get treatment after his breakdown since he is an adult, but he said he believes Alex Brizzi will go to a mental health center after he recovers from his physical wounds. \\"We really didn't think he was a risk to himself and he's never been a risk to anyone else,\\" he said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"On Thursday afternoon, a man claiming to have a bomb strapped to his chest threatened a Baltimore TV station and was later shot by the police after walking out of the building. The suspect has been identified as 25-year-old Alex Brizzi, who is in serious condition but expected to survive. The alleged explosive device turned out to be chocolate candy bars wrapped in wires, with another device meant to look like a detonator. Brizzi entered the Fox 45 building dressed in a hedgehog onesie outfit and medical mask, claiming he had a bomb. A security guard at the station said Brizzi had a flash drive containing files related to astronomy. The Baltimore police spokesperson, T.J. Smith, stated that the suspect was shot at least three times after refusing to cooperate. The police robot helped the department communicate with the man without getting too close, and retrieve the fake explosive device. No injuries, besides Brizzi's, were reported."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

When someone is choking, they'll lose the ability to speak because air can't get through. Therefore, if you ask your toddler a question and she can't reply, she may be choking. You may notice that he's having trouble drawing breaths. He may also be making weird noises when he's breathing, such as a high-pitched noise when drawing in a breath. Your toddler may be trying to cough up what's in her throat and failing. Therefore, the cough will be weak. A heavy cough likely indicates that enough air is getting through that she's not choking. Toddlers who aren't breathing may start turning blue around the edges. For instance, you may notice bluish or dusky tinges on her fingernails, lips, or skin. However, be aware that children and toddlers compensate much better than adults and may not turn blue as fast as an adult would. If the child is able to speak or breathe well, don't start Heimlich. The same goes if the child is able to cough hard. However, be watching to make sure the symptoms don't suddenly worsen. Choking can cause a toddler to pass out. See if he can look at you when you talk by asking him a question. You'll likely need this information when you call 911. You'll also need to move on to the steps for an unconscious choking toddler if he's not conscious. You can also lightly flick the bottom of a toddler's foot to check for consciousness. If you are not alone with the child, ask someone to call 911. If you are, you should try the Heimlich maneuver before calling 911. If a parent is present, quickly ask for consent. Seconds count when saving a life. If a parent is not present, Good Samaritan laws in your state should cover any action you take in good faith to save the child's life.","completion":"This article explains how to identify choking in toddlers by observing their inability to speak, difficulty breathing, weak cough, and potential bluish tinges; and advises when to perform the Heimlich maneuver, call 911, and assess consciousness, emphasizing the importance of quick action to save a child's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Would be at least 4 stars but let me explain the reasoning behind my review of 1 star. I discovered Tracy Rigg via Yelp where a fellow Elite rated her services as 5 stars while I was on a hunt for a natural stylist in Charlotte to prevent from my constant travels back home to Chicago to get my hair done. I made an appointment to see Tracy while she was in the SouthPark location and was pleased with my cut and the product not too much the style as it made me look like a old women with the extreme layers. After I wrapped it and slept on it it fell like I would've liked it to so I LOVED the results as they were due to the products which I purchased (No Parabens - Tracy products) and her process of getting my natural hair straightened for the first time since I went natural. Tracy schedule is pretty tight and after having that personal appointment in an one on one setting was SOLD and expressed my desire to have her as my hair stylist in Charlotte for my straightening twice a year. Let's get to this 1 STAR review: Last year December my daughter and I were heading home for our annual Nutcracker ballet show and I tried scheduling with Tracy as early as October and was unsuccessful as the site is very deceiving as it allow you to choose Tracy and see her schedule and even choose a time however when you click SCHEDULE you get an error that states \\"Tracy Riggs requires you to call in to schedule\\" which I did and left a message and didn't get a call back after 5 days so I emailed and got a response that the days that I saw were available are no longer available and since our flights were booked we had no alternative dates and time so she suggested her new stylist from our hometown of Chicago (Kim) and we accepted. NOTE: This was her way of not accepting us as a client Kim did a great job however it was EXTREMELY overpriced we paid 180 for two wash and blowouts, needless to say we didn't go back afterwards. FastForward to this week: I'm having a baby in a couple days and already haver plans for Christmas so again I tried to schedule an appointment with Tracy online and got the same error I mentioned earlier so again I called and never received a call back. Three days later I called again and mentioned my message I left and my issue scheduling, this time I was told FLAT OUT \\" Tracy isn't accepting clients she only accept appointments for regulars\\". My issue with this is 1. The website is deceiving where it allow you to see all the availability of Tracy where her schedule has space 2. How can you become a regular if you are NEVER able to schedule? 3. The unprofessionalism when a potential client leaves a message with contact info and no one returns the call or try to return the call. Needless to say, I will not be trying this place again. The new location is nice as I visited last year and uploaded a photo BUT that's it that's all. I'll stick to driving to ATL to Loop Salon or flying home to Chicago to get my hair done by professionals who schedules are clear and they don't discriminate against new clients or toward those clients who only want to come twice a year to avoid heat damage to natural hair....OPT: a). negative. b). positive. I think the answer is","completion":"a). negative. The sentiment of the review is negative. The reviewer faces multiple issues such as scheduling difficulties, unprofessionalism in returning calls, and deception on the website regarding appointment availability. They also mention having to pay extremely high prices for the services. As a result, the reviewer decides not to try this place again and resorts to finding alternatives in other locations. The other option, positive sentiment, is incorrect because the review is primarily focused on the negative experiences and dissatisfaction with the salon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Whitney Museum of American Art - known informally as the \\"Whitney\\" - is an art museum located in Manhattan. It was founded in 1931 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875-1942), a wealthy and prominent American socialite and art patron after whom the museum is named. The Whitney focuses on 20th- and 21st-century American art. Its permanent collection comprises more than 21,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, films, videos, and artifacts of new media by more than 3,000 artists. In 1961, the museum began seeking a site for a larger building. The Whitney settled in 1966 at the southeast corner of Madison Avenue at 75th Street in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The building, planned and built 1963-1966 by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton P. Smith in a distinctively modern style, is easily distinguished from the neighboring townhouses by its staircase facade made from granite stones and its external upside-down windows. In 1967, Mauricio Lasansky showed The Nazi Drawings. The exhibition traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, where they appeared with shows by Louise Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth as the first exhibits installed in the new museum. The institution grappled with space problems for decades. From 1973 to 1983 the Whitney operated its first branch at 55 Water Street, in a building owned by Harold Uris who gave the museum a lease for 1 a year. In 1983 Philip Morris installed a Whitney branch in the lobby of its Park Avenue headquarters. In 1981 the museum opened an exhibition space in Stamford, Connecticut, that was housed in Champion International Corporation. In the late 1980s, the Whitney entered into arrangements with Park Tower Realty, I.B.M. and The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, setting up satellite museums with rotating exhibitions in the lobbies of their buildings. Each museum had its own director, and all plans were to be approved by a Whitney committee. The institution has tried to expand its landmark building and in 1978 commissioned UK architects Derek Walker and Norman Foster to design a tall tower alongside, the first of several proposals from leading architects. But each time the effort was abandoned, either because of the cost or the design or both. In order to secure additional space for the museum's collections, then-director Thomas N. Armstrong III developed plans for a 10-story, 37.5-million addition to the Whitney's main building. The proposed addition, designed by Michael Graves and announced in 1985, drew immediate opposition. Graves had proposed demolishing the flanking brownstones down to the East 74th Street corner for a complementary addition. After the project gradually lost the support of many of the museum's trustees, the plans were dropped in 1989. Between 1995 and 1998, the building underwent a renovation and addition by Richard Gluckman. In 2001, Rem Koolhaas was commissioned to submit two designs for a 200 million expansion; plans were dropped again in 2003, causing director Maxwell L. Anderson to resign. New York restaurateur Danny Meyer opened Untitled, a restaurant in the museum in March 2011. The space was designed by the Rockwell Group.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: any notable person in the article","completion":"The Whitney Museum of American Art has hosted and exhibited works by numerous notable artists, including Louise Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth.

Select from: (a). yes (b). it is not possible to tell (c). no","completion":"c). no The architectural style of houses in Islamic culture is indeed characterized by certain features, one of which may include central courtyards with fountains. However, stating that the architectural style is solely based on buildings built along fountains would not be accurate. Islamic architecture is influenced by various factors, including history, regional context, cultural elements, and religious beliefs. The central hallway or courtyard, called qa'a in some cases, is an important feature of many traditional Islamic homes. This courtyard serves multiple purposes, such as providing natural light, improving air circulation, and promoting a sense of community among the residents. The fountain in the middle not only adds an aesthetic touch but also cools the environment and creates a soothing ambiance with the sound of flowing water. However, Islamic architecture isn't limited to or defined by the presence of fountains. Many other elements commonly found in Islamic architectural styles include the following: 1. Geometric patterns and arabesques: Islamic art and architecture often feature intricate geometric designs and floral patterns that serve both an aesthetic and a functional purpose. These patterns symbolize the infinite nature of the universe and the concept of divine unity. 2. Muqarnas: These ornamental decorations are found in Islamic architecture as a method of transitioning between differing architectural shapes, such as transitioning between a dome and its supporting walls. Muqarnas can also be seen in the decorative corbels and other ornamental elements. 3. Minarets: In the context of mosques, minarets are tall, slender towers with one or more projecting balconies. They serve as a visual focal point, representing the place from which the call to prayer is made. 4. Arches and vaults: Islamic buildings often incorporate a variety of arches, such as horseshoe, pointed, or multifoil arches. They are essential to architectural design, supporting the structure while also adding a graceful touch. 5. Domes: Often seen in mosques, mausoleums, and palaces, domes act as both a structural and symbolic element. Domes represent the heavens and the cosmos, and they are significant in Islamic religious architecture. 5. Gardens: Gardens are essential features of many Islamic residences and public buildings. They symbolize paradise and provide a tranquil space for relaxation, contemplation, and socialization. They may include fountains, ponds, and lush vegetation. In conclusion, while fountains and water elements play a significant role in Islamic architecture, they are just one aspect of a complex and multi-faceted set of architectural characteristics. It would be too simplistic and incorrect to assume that the architecture of Islamic houses is solely based on buildings built along fountains. They are part of a diverse range of features that, combined, create the unique and beautiful style known as Islamic architecture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Justification process: 1. The premise states that Finn, who is now the hero, is asked to help a shackled and bloodied escaped killer (Robert De Niro) by providing food, drink, and a tool for cutting chains. This interaction only provides the evidence that Finn is put in a situation where he needs to assist the killer. It doesn't provide any implication about Finn's emotions or willingness on being a hero or in helping the killer. 2. The hypothesis, on the other hand, attributes specific emotional states to Finn - happiness being the hero and not minding helping the killer. These emotional states are not described or implied anywhere within the premise. 3. Therefore, while we can infer that Finn has responsibilities as the hero (including helping the killer), we cannot make definitive assumptions about Finn's emotional state or his feelings towards being a hero and assisting the killer based only the given premise. Conclusion: The premise doesn't fully support or entail the hypothesis as it doesn't provide detailed information on Finn's emotional state or his feelings towards his assigned task.

Review: The Howling II starts as it means to go on with a bizarre and surreal opening narration by Christopher Lee whose image is imposed over a moving star field, oh and a skeleton appears as well for some reason. He says \\"for it's written the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with her blood. And I saw her sip upon a hairy beast and she held forth a golden challis full of the filthiest fornication's and upon her forehead was written, behold I am the great Mother of #an inaudible word I couldn't make out no matter how many times I rewound the tape and tried to, sorry# and all abominations of the Earth\\". This opening narration means nothing at all and is just downright bizarre. After the opening credits which are set over shots of Transylvanian architecture we get an on screen caption that informs us we're in 'Los Angeles, California U.S.A. City of the Angels'. I knew I was in for a long 86 minutes. It's probably not too long after the events of the original Howling (1981) and it's Karen White's funeral. After the ceremony Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) is spoken to by an 'occult investigator' called Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee) who says that Karen is a Werewolf and that she will come back to life. Ben dismisses such nonsense. But together with one of Karen's friends and colleagues Jenny (Annie McEnroe) he visits Stefan at his home. There Stefan tells them about Werewolves and how they can be killed, he mentions Stirba (Sybil Danning) who is the queen of Werewolves. Stefan also shows them a photograph taken at Karen's funeral of a woman named Mariana (Marsha A. Hunt) and that she is an extremely vicious and dangerous Werewolf who wants Karen. Stefan says he will stake any Werewoves through the heart with titanium. Ben figures out that Stefan means he will stake Karen as well so together with Jenny he travels to the graveyard where his sister's crypt is to stop Stefan. However lots of Werewolves turn up and attack Stefan, Ben and Jenny. They survive the attack and manage to find out that Stirba is to be found in Transylvania. They all decide to travel to Transylvania and stop Stirba and her Werewolves from taking over the Earth by fulfilling a centuries old curse. Once there they travel to a small town called Vlkava which means 'where wolves live' and meet up with the local priest, Father Florin (Ladislav Krecmer) and his small but loyal group of Werewolf hunters, hey what else can I call them? Oh, and a dwarf named Florica (Ludmila Safarova) helps too. They follow Mariana who they hope will lead them to Stirba. But Stirba knows of Stefan's arrival and has plans for him Ben and Jenny. Will Stefan be able to put an end to Stirba's plans for world domination? Will this film get any more bizarre or surreal? Watch it and find out. Directed by Philippe Mora this is one strange mess of a film. It's poorly edited as certain sequences just jump around incoherently. The single biggest problem is the script by Robert Sano and Gary Brandner based on his novel which is all over the place and doesn't make any sort of sense or introduces us to any proper characters that we like. Luckily it moves along like a rocket and is never dull or boring, unlike the original. Something strange or bizarre is always happening to keep the viewer entertained. Most people will probably hate it, but for those of us who enjoy 'bad' films this is right up there with the best of them. There are Werewolf orgies which are just freaky to watch. We get some cool Werewolf killing weaponry. The sets and locations just seem so out of place and I don't know if this was actually shot in Transylvania but it doesn't look like what I thought mid 80's Transylvania would. Stirba's castle is part dungeon, part Gothic castle and part modern luxury house. Stirba and her servant's costumes are very over-the-top, Stirba wears an outfit that looks like it belongs in a S/M video and to be fair to her she looks pretty sexy, and her minions wear skimpy leather clothing too. The special make-up effects range from good to poor, a dwarf's eyes explode, someone has their hand ripped off and a priest has some creature emerge from his mouth but this isn't a film loaded with gore, although there are plenty of effect sequences with Werewolf transformations and attacks. There is plenty of nudity as well as Stirba and her minions are a real randy bunch of Werewolves! I should also mention the music, the soundtrack is dominated by awful rock music that I hated and I ended up turning the volume down. Acting is weak all round and what on Earth was Christopher Lee thinking about when he accepted this film?! I wonder what he thinks of it. Basically the whole thing is a real mess, but I found it a fairly entertaining mess all the same. Impossible to recommend but it kept me watching through to the end. Speaking of which the end credits run over what appears to be deleted scenes and cut footage, it also features the same shot of Sybil Danning taking her dress off and exposing her breasts probably in excess of 20 times!

Back experts in the USA were worried that young students are having back and neck problems because they are carrying too much in their backpacks (schoolbags). \\"It hurts my back when I run,\\" said Eglin Reyes, a student in Virginia. \\"It's hard to get up the stairs with my backpack because it's too heavy.\\" Students have to carry heavy backpacks on their backs for a whole week's study. Beeline is one of them. They have regular backpacks with two straps to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads have switched to rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, \\"I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain.\\" How much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten the load: Less homework. Doctor's suggestions: *Lighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that night. *Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps. *The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back. *Bend both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend the waist .

Here is an article: Matthew Ryan Williams for The New York Times State Senator Ed Murray, who is challenging Mayor Mike McGinn, with supporters Monday in downtown Seattle. SEATTLE â Mayor Mike McGinn seems like the kind of candidate this city would love. A former Sierra Club chapter leader and an avid cyclist, he bikes to work from his home in north Seattle. He has focused his campaign for a second term on issues voters care about here: climate change, transportation and reducing police brutality. And the economy is doing pretty well, with construction cranes whirring on the horizon and job numbers growing. But on the eve of Election Day, polls suggested that Mr. McGinn was in trouble, running behind his challenger, a state senator seeking to become Seattleâs first openly gay mayor. A recent poll by Strategies 360 of 400 likely voters had the senator, Ed Murray, leading by 17 percentage points, with 51 percent of respondents supporting him. The poll, conducted Oct. 14-16, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. Mr. Murray has run as problem-solver who agrees with Mr. McGinn on many issues this overwhelmingly liberal city looks for. But he says Mr. McGinn is too combative, having angered corporations and members of the nine-member City Council, five of whom have endorsed Mr. Murray. He points in particular to the mayorâs handling of a complaint by the Justice Department in late 2011 accusing the Seattle Police Department of racial insensitivity and using excessive force. Mr. Murray asserts that the mayorâs tactics delayed resolution of the dispute and hurt the city. âWe are years behind where we could have been because he chose to fight the Justice Department, he chose to fight the Council, he choose to fight the city attorney, he chose to fight the U.S. attorney,â Mr. Murray said at a news conference Monday in a downtown park, surrounded by City Council members. A spokesman for Mr. McGinn, Aaron Pickus, said Seattleâs settlement with the Justice Department in reforming the police department was among the fastest such agreements ever. âLook at what really happened,â Mr. Pickus said. Mr. Murray may be benefiting from his sexual orientation as well. Seattle has surpassed San Francisco as having the highest percentage of same-sex households among big cities in the nation â 2.61 percent, compared with 2.46 in San Francisco â according to census figures. And Mr. Murray has also seized on that trend in his campaign, with a new television ad in the closing days showing him walking with his husband. It reminds voters that Mr. Murray, through years of work in the State Senate, is largely considered one of the fathers of Washingtonâs same-sex marriage law, which was approved statewide by voters last year. The ad features a parade of supporters not so subtly answering a question about their belief in Mr. Murray and the cityâs future under his leadership with the repeated refrain, âI do.â The adâs final scene: a lesbian marriage. âFor the L.G.B.T. community, heâs a vital leader,â said Jeff Spitko, the chief marketing officer at the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a group based in Washington, D.C., that works to elect gay politicians and has raised money for Mr. Murray around the country. Mr. McGinn, for his part, has accused Mr. Murray of trying to have it both ways, expressing support in the past for some of the mayorâs positions and programs, but now finding only fault as a candidate. But unlike some political races around the country with a gay candidate, sexual orientation has not been an issue, except when Mr. Murray brings it up himself. Mr. Murray has spent about 752,000 to Mr. McGinnâs 466,000, according to state disclosure filings. But Mr. McGinn has suggested that corporate money, especially contributions from the cable giant Comcast to political action committees supporting Mr. Murray, could influence decisions on the cityâs efforts to expand high-speed broadband. Mr. McGinn spent his final afternoon of campaigning in south Seattle. Mr. Murray used the day to embrace what he called his âteam of rivals,â including some who ran against him in the primary but have now endorsed him â all to show that he is able to work with a broad range of people. The election is being held against a backdrop of economic growth that has brought new jobs to Seattle, but also caused housing prices and rents to rise, and traffic to snarl. At the same time, a wave of highly publicized crimes in recent years has made many people feel that the city has become less safe. Mr. McGinn has found himself having to address those issues, especially in lower-income neighborhoods. âWeâve been adding more jobs and people than we are housing â weâre not keeping up,â he said at a town-hall-style meeting Sunday near the University of Washington. That growth, in places like South Lake Union, where Amazon is building a giant headquarters complex, and Ballard, a north-end neighborhood that has exploded with new apartments, is bringing vitality and jobs. But a policy under Mr. McGinn to push mass transit and discourage driving in the city has made street parking more difficult. âYouâre making it even worse,â said Robert E. Stumberger, a resident who confronted Mr. McGinn about the parking policy at Sundayâs meeting.

I came to it not as a devout Catholic but as a fan of travel videos. In other words, I watched this video with the same motivation I would have to watch Shackleton's Antarctic exploration, or something from the Globe Trekker series.With that in mind, the target audience for this video is not me.

However, it is important to note that the reviewer acknowledges that their perspective may not align with that of the target audience. They mention that devout Catholics are more likely to enjoy the video, suggesting that their negative tone arises mainly from the fact that the video did not cater to their personal interests.

The film opens with a shot of a majestic old house. We hear the beginning of the film's main musical theme, followed by a young boy in a voice-over calling young Alexander to join him to see \\"an ancient city under the sea.\\" Alexander tiptoes past his parents' bedroom, from where emanate a woman's giggles. Once outside the back door of the house, he runs on a short wooden walkway that ends at the beach, where he joins his two friends. He drops his short pants and they all three run into the sea and start swimming toward the open waters.Cut to Alexander (Bruno Ganz) as an older man, sitting in an armchair. He has just been awakened by his housekeeper, Urania (Helene Gerasimidou). \\"This is the last day\\" she says, \\"Let me come with you to the hospital.\\" Alexander, very philosophically, refuses and he thanks her for her three years of faithful service. She leaves the room, but promptly returns for an ultimate glance at Alexander, on the pretext of reminding him that his dog has eaten, before furtively leaving again. Alexander, now alone, finishes his cup of coffee. The camera moves to show the balcony, where the dog is lying down, and the sea panorama. Alexander turns on his record player which plays the film's theme for a moment. He turns it off, and looking through the window toward the harbor and then toward the adjacent building, he hears an echo of the same music coming from one of the apartments. Alexander says it happens every morning, and he wonders aloud who it might be and why.Alexander takes his dog for a walk along the harbor.

Dramatic scenes continue despite pleas for them to stop from church. Five other Bulgarian men have set. themselves on fire since February. Three of them. have died and two remain in critical condition. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Poverty-Driven Self-Immolations Plague the Nation as Unemployment Soars As the economic crisis deepens, the unnamed man could no longer afford to buy bread for his child. In a harrowing incident that underscores the severity of Bulgaria's social and economic ills, a man set himself on fire outside a public building to protest the government's inability to aid the people in dire straits. This gut-wrenching spectacle does not stand alone, as five other Bulgarian men have resorted to self-immolation since February, signaling a worrying trend that cannot be ignored. With the nation gripped by tumultuous scenes of hardship and despair, calls have been made from the church and various humanitarian organizations to address the alarming rise in self-immolations. Three of the men who succumbed to this drastic measure have passed away, while the remaining two remain in critical condition, fighting for their lives. The wider community has condemned these shocking acts of defiance but acknowledges the devastating circumstances that have driven individuals to such extremes. As the job market withers away due to the economic downturn, thousands of Bulgarians struggle to make ends meet, living in impoverished conditions, and struggling daily for necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. High unemployment rates have fueled anger and desperation, prompting a spate of dramatic and heartbreaking episodes across the nation. The government has been blamed for not adequately handling the economic crisis, which has led to increased poverty levels and pervasive social unrest. To curb this bleak trend, both governmental and non-governmental organizations are hard at work to identify and mitigate the factors that have contributed to these horrific protests. The church has also become heavily involved, urging the populace to pray and hold onto hope, while also imploring the administration to address the deepening crisis. They have called for a comprehensive social safety net, accessible mental health programs, and economic stimuli to create new job opportunities and restore hope to the downtrodden populace. Social welfare organizations and non-profits are focused on providing immediate help to those most desperate in their hour of need. Support is being offered in the form of temporary housing, food assistance, guidance, and, perhaps most crucially, a listening ear and comforting shoulder. However, these efforts may not be enough. Many believe that the government must take swift action to restore faith in the ability of the Bulgarian system to protect its people, especially in times of economic adversity. Widespread unemployment must be combatted with proactive measures, such as job creation programs and attractive economic incentives for local and foreign investment. Critics argue that the government cannot afford to ignore the plight of its citizens any longer, lest the tide of self-immolations continues to rise. The time has come to adopt new, innovative policies, invest in human capital, and ultimately, work towards addressing the root causes of poverty in Bulgaria. Without such drastic measures, the nation risks spiraling into a vortex of anguish and despair, unable to recover from the storm currently engulfing it. In conclusion, the tragic series of self-immolations experienced in Bulgaria demands immediate attention from all segments of society, most notably, the government. With the church, NGOs, and citizens banding together to aid those pushed to despair by oppressive socio-economic conditions, it is crucial the government now play its part by implementing targeted policies aimed at fighting poverty and supporting those in need. For the sake of the nation's future, it is a call that must be heeded."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

As punishment, Leela is fitted with a shock collar to teach her anger management.

Unfortunately, he soon gets lost in his fantasy and goes on a rampage, resulting in his commitment to the Hal Institute for Criminally Insane Robots. The crew learns that Mom, who controls the world's only Dark Matter mine, is restricting the supply in order to drive up profits. The Professor reveals to the crew that while working for her many years ago, he stumbled on a way to turn dark matter from a useless curiosity into starship fuel. The process created two energy crystals, with Mom keeping one for herself and Farnsworth hiding the other, \\"anti-backwards\\" crystal. If the two crystals are brought together, they will render all dark matter useless.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Moreover, the author has noticed a positive impact from offering more targeted, focused coaching sessions to educators and corporate clients, instead of longer workshops.

Classic dystopian British science fiction that draws powerful and moving parallels to the state of the world. 2. Owen delivers one of his best performances as a lifeless man, whose activist spirit is unexpectedly reignited by his contact with Kee. 3. If you thought the battle scenes in... Saving Private Ryan were tough going, the final 20 minutes of Children of Men will not only shake you, they'll have you revising your expectations about just how realistic cinematic portrayals of combat can get. 4. And yet... And yet... For all its fine parts, Children Of Men is somehow less than the sum. 5. Cuaron doesn't treat his future world like fictitious science fiction. He seems to be saying that our current paths will lead to an apocalypse not unlike this one. 6. Ultimately grimy, both in subject matter and visually, thanks to set designers Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland), the picture is frightening and powerful. 7. By letting his film lapse into a standard action movie, Cuaron I think has suffered a regrettable failure of imagination. 8. Children of Men is like an elongated episode of Doctor Who for adults, without the funny bits, David Tennant's oozy charm and the ironic sense of its own fundamental silliness. 9. It's a disturbing tale that is exceptionally uncomfortable to watch because it's almost believable in spite of how ludicrous it first appears. 10. Fortunately, the film rarely slows down long enough to proselytize, especially in the hellish refugee-camp climax, a horrid polyglot of ceaseless conflict that could be any war zone on the planet. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"The overall consensus about the movie \\"Children of Men\\" appears to be generally positive, with most reviewers appreciating its thought-provoking dystopian themes, powerful performances, and realistic portrayal of combat. Many reviewers found the movie disturbing and unsettling, but this seems to be part of its intended impact, as it effectively highlights the potential consequences of humanity's current path. The movie is praised for its strong social and political commentary and for not treating its futuristic setting as mere science fiction. Owen's acting was particularly praised, with one reviewer mentioning that he delivers one of his best performances. The combat scenes were also a primary focus of appreciation; for instance, one reviewer mentions that the final 20 minutes of the film surpass expectations of how realistically cinematic portrayals of combat can be shown. However, there are also critiques that the film falls short of realizing its full potential, with some arguing that it eventually conforms to the conventions of a standard action movie, indicating a possible lack of imagination. One review even compares it to an elongated episode of Doctor Who for adults, albeit without humor or charm. In conclusion, the overall consensus for \\"Children of Men\\" is positive, with most reviewers appreciating its themes, performances, and depiction of combat. The movie is considered a disturbing yet powerful experience, but there are critics who argue that it could have been even better, had it not fallen into the trappings of a typical action film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As it grows downward to form the tap root, lateral roots branch off to all sides, producing the typical dicot tap root system. In monocot seeds (Figure 32.21), the testa and tegmen of the seed coat are fused. As the seed germinates, the primary root emerges, protected by the root-tip covering: the coleorhiza.

(3). dog. (4). knife. (5). disease. (6). Movement. (7). influenza. (8). h2o. The answer is:","completion":"(2). stress. Given the two facts provided, threatening behavior causes a fight-or-flight response in animals, which is an extreme response to stress. The fight-or-flight response is a physiological and psychological reaction to a perceived dangerous or threatening situation. When an animal perceives a threat, its body releases stress hormones to prepare it for dealing with the danger, either by fighting off the threat or fleeing from it. This response helps animals to survive in the wild by enabling them to react quickly and efficiently to potentially life-threatening situations. In modern human society, the fight-or-flight response can also be activated by stressors like work pressure, relationship issues, and other everyday challenges. Despite being an essential survival mechanism, the constant activation of the fight-or-flight response in contemporary life may contribute to mental and physical health issues, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, and other stress-related disorders. To sum up, the correct answer to the question is that threatening behavior causes stress in animals.

On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, after Rey Mysterio expressed his feelings about being World Heavyweight Champion, John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield came out and declared himself the number-one contender. JBL immediately began degrading Mysterio because of his Mexican heritage, saying he was an illegal immigrant and that Mysterio doesn’t deserve to be champion. Mysterio reacted by saying that he'd fight anyone at any time. In turn, JBL announced that Mysterio would face off against Mark Henry later that night. During the match, Mysterio tried to use his quickness to avoid Henry, but was easily countered by Henry's power. Mysterio was able to hit a 619 and a Seated senton, but was defeated when Henry hit the World's Strongest Slam for the pin. The next week on SmackDown!, JBL announced that Mysterio would take on The Great Khali later that night. During the match, Mysterio attempted a springboard dropkick, but it had no effect. Khali then picked up Mysterio and hit a Two-handed chokeslam for the win. On the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL said that Mysterio didn't look so well due to the beatings he endured in past weeks and that he probably didn't even know what day it was. Mysterio answered and told him the day, May 19. Kane, who in recent weeks attacked anyone who said May 19, came out and faced off against Mysterio. Kane dominated most of the match, hitting a variety of power moves. Kane then began to hear voices in his head saying May 19, which caused him to go into a psychotic trance. JBL told him to finish the job, but mistakenly said May 19, causing Kane to attack him. As a result, the match ended in a no-contest.

Pronoun usage could reflect either natural or grammatical gender, when those conflicted (as in the case of wīf, a neuter noun referring to a female person). Question: What type of gender is present in modern English nouns?","completion":"Modern English nouns primarily exhibit natural gender, which means that gender is assigned to the nouns based on the biological sex or attributes of the referent, rather than on grammatical rules. This is a shift from Old English, where nouns had grammatical gender, and gender was determined by the conventions and structure of the language, irrespective of the biological or natural characteristics of the noun. In Modern English, we typically use gendered pronouns like \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" for nouns referring to people or animals with a known biological sex, while employing neutral pronouns like \\"it\\" for inanimate objects or animals with an unspecified sex.

Mark Bridger was slashed across the face with a razor blade at the maximum security prison where he is serving a whole-life term for the horrific murder. The 47-year-old was taken to hospital for stitches on Sunday and returned to HMP Wakefield a few hours later. Bridger abducted April, who had cerebral palsy, while she was playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Mid-Wales, last October. Mark Bridger, who murdered April Jones, was slashed in the face with a makeshift knife at Wakefield prison. He sexually abused her, killed her and then dismembered and disposed of her body. The former abattoir worker has refused. to reveal what he did with April’s remains and claimed during his trial. she died in a car accident. Police believe he dumped her body. parts in the hills, rivers and forests surrounding his remote home in. Ceinws. Traces of her blood and skull fragments were found at his rented. cottage. Yesterday Machynlleth villagers. applauded the prisoner who attacked April’s killer and appealed to. Bridger to reveal what he did with her body to make his own life behind. bars easier. Julie Williams, a mother-of-two, said: ‘No one has any. sympathy for him. ‘He is so evil for not saying where. her body is. Other prisoners may lay off him if he lets the authorities. know what he did with April. ‘It’s the least he should do – this. attack may frighten him into doing the right thing. But it won’t bring. April back to her family.’ Bridger was reportedly slashed in the face as he walked along a gangway at HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Bridger, who has six children by four. women, was attacked as he walked along a gangway and is badly scarred,. according to reports. Friends of April’s family said they had no. sympathy. ‘Was he expecting an easy ride in prison? He doesn’t deserve any sympathy after what he did,’ said Alexander Darracott. Carole Davies said: ‘Hopefully he will. live in fear for his life every day. Imagine little April’s fear and. terror.’ And councillor Michael Williams said: ‘His crimes were. horrendous to say the least and this will come as a wake-up call to him. about just how he is seen by the rest of the country.’ Bridger was recently transferred to. HMP Wakefield, the largest maximum security jail in the country, which. houses a number of child killers including Roy Whiting, Levi Bellfield. and Mick Philpott. Despite tight security – including. segregation for paedophiles and child killers – attacks with makeshift. blades and other improvised weapons are not uncommon.

This riveting drama boasts an excellent cast, powerful storytelling, and a unique take on the prison-film genre. In this review, we will discuss the elements that make this film a timeless and uplifting classic. Step 2: Plot Synopsis The story follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a successful banker who is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy forms a unique bond with fellow inmate Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and together they navigate the corrupt world of prison life. Despite the cruelty and despair that surround them, Andy and Red find hope and redemption through friendship, resilience, and resourcefulness. Step 3: Acting and Performance Tim Robbins delivers an outstanding performance as Andy Dufresne, evoking both vulnerability and determination in his portrayal. His quiet strength and intelligence shine through, making the audience resonate with his character.

Gramophone record For collectable or nostalgia purposes, or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups, a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production. One of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s, when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records, which released, in addition to standard 33 1/3 rpm LPs, 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves). This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s \\"hi-fi\\" era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before).

Birds of all ages can be infected, but quail chicks are particularly vulnerable. OPT: (A). Once the infection begins it can take between three and five weeks for the virus to finish its course. When infected with the wet form of the virus, a quail will suffer from irritation in the respiratory system, including internal lesions. (B). Since the pox is contagious within a few hours of the first killing of the chickens, the disease may infect the sheds and/or other structures in the flock or surrounding buildings. It is particularly easy to diagnose and treat the pox in dry weather, so be sure you check that gardens and coop equipment are accessible. (C). It is usually not part of the breeding season for quail. However, if you are sick with the pox, you should bring along a bulb or a small syringe for disinfectant. (D). You should watch out for signs that the infection comes into contact with your quail's hind quarters and other areas. The parasites that cause the pox are also at risk.","completion":"(A).

Playing in their second game of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals had a lot of things go wrong. Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58-48 for the second-most combined points. The Redskins (72) and Giants (41) combined for 113 points in 1966 for the most.

Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies.

Abstinence programs teach teenagers how to have meaningful , age-appropriate relationships , and help young people fight the pressure of having sex before they are ready . 3. Abstinence-only education teaches adolescents that they do not need to rush into sexual relationships by dispelling the notion that sex is something teenagers should be having , and by helping young people explore other ways of being emotionally intimate . 4.

By leaving out discussions of sex , it reassures teenagers that they do not need to think or worry about sex until they are older , and avoids giving the impression that sex is an important or relevant topic for children .","completion":"The argument implied by these sentences suggests that our society is highly sexualized, and as a result, many young girls experience guilt and regret after engaging in their first sexual encounters. In response to this issue, abstinence programs provide an alternative approach to sex education, offering guidance on cultivating meaningful and age-appropriate relationships while empowering teenagers to resist the pressure to engage in sexual activities before they feel ready. These abstinence-only education initiatives aim to debunk the idea that teenagers should be having sex and instead encourage adolescents to explore different ways of developing emotional intimacy. Furthermore, the argument highlights that a significant number of sexually active teenagers (nearly 30%, as mentioned in the Kaiser Family Foundation study) feel pressured to have sex, emphasizing the need for abstinence programs to address this problem. By deliberately omitting discussions about sex, the abstinence programs seek to reassure teenagers that they do not need to contemplate or be concerned about sexual matters until they are older. This strategy aims to avoid perpetuating the belief that sex should be a relevant or crucial topic for young individuals, thereby providing an alternative framework for forming healthy and emotionally fulfilling relationships without the pressures and potential negative consequences associated with early sexual experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This option is the most suitable answer for the question because when a person buys a new monitor and unpacks it, they usually connect it to a computer (often referred to as a desktop) in order to use it. Connecting the monitor to the desktop allows James to display images, access the internet, and perform various other tasks on his computer using the new monitor as a visual output device. While the other options may seem related, they do not accurately answer the question: - Internet cafe: This is a place where someone can use a computer with internet access, usually at a per-hour rate or through a subscription. An internet cafe is not a direct object that a monitor can be connected to. - Display images: Monitors are used to display images as a function, but this does not define what the monitor is connected to. The device that the monitor must be connected to, in this case, is the desktop. - Box: A box is a container for packaging and storage. While James did unbox the monitor, he connected the monitor to a computer (desktop), not a box. - View bluescreen: A bluescreen is an error message displayed on the computer screen due to hardware or software issues. This option does not represent what the monitor is connected to directly.

When her grandmother needs to go to a nursing home, Carrie has to move in with her father Hank, a rancher in Wyoming, whom she hasn't seen since she was a baby. Initially reluctant to adapt to country living, Carrie soon meets Flicka, a beautiful black Mustang that previously had belonged to Carrie's cousin Katy, who asked Hank to look after Flicka when her father sold their own ranch. Flicka is wild and dangerous and, according to the ranchers, longs for Katy. However, when Carrie is attacked by a rattlesnake, Flicka saves her and the two form a bond. Carrie also meets Jake, an attractive ranch hand hoping to become a country singer, and Amy Walker, the proud and arrogant daughter of a neighbour. Although Jake and Carrie take an immediate liking to each other, there is instant animosity between Carrie and Amy, mainly because Amy also likes Jake. When Carrie disobeys her father's rules regarding visits to the nearest town, Hank decides to punish Carrie by temporarily relocating Flicka to the farm of one of his ranch hands, Toby. After a midnight visit by Carrie, Flicka tries to follow Carrie home to Hank's ranch, but accidentally ends up on the ranch belonging to Amy's father HD Walker. Upon entering the Walker ranch, Flicka damages a fence and releases some of HD's prize cows. At Amy's request, HD asks for Flicka as payment for the damage, threatening to turn it into a lawsuit if Hank refuses. Amy then starts training with Flicka for a championship, but performs poorly during the actual competition because of Flicka's fear of the crowd and camera flashes from the audience.

Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

While attending my MOS AIT in the US Army (good lord, was that 25 years ago???), a few of us had a hotel party. It didn’t get too crazy as it was mainly to get off post. If I remember right, after some folks left, there was one couple, a couple girls (maybe 3?), and myself who stayed over. I had known them all for a month or so and had spent a ton of time hanging out at the barracks or around the school area. The couple took one bed, the girls took the other, and I took the floor at the foot of the girls’ bed.

She and I had both recently gotten engaged to people two plane flights away and had been nothing more than friends previously - with no hint of anything else… I thought nothing of it and said sure. After a few minutes, she said she couldn’t sleep and asked if she could snuggle up a little. I thought nothing of it and said sure. I started to think… hunh… this is peculiar… After a few more minutes, she asked if I minded if we kissed a little.

Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) is a Japanese electronic music band formed in Tokyo in 1978 by Haruomi Hosono (bass, keyboards, vocals), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums, lead vocals) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards, vocals). The group is considered influential and innovative in the field of popular electronic music. They were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers, and digital recording technology in popular music, and effectively anticipated the \\"electropop boom\\" of the 1980s while exploring subversive sociopolitical themes throughout their career. YMO was initially conceived by Hosono as a one-off exploration of computerized exotica and parody of Western conceptions of the orient. Prior to the group's formation, Sakamoto had been experimenting with electronic music equipment at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, which he entered in 1970, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP. Hosono, following the break-up of his band Happy End in 1972, became involved in the recording of several early electronic rock records, including Yosui Inoue's folk pop rock album Kori no Sekai (1973) and Osamu Kitajima's progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten (1974), both of which utilized synthesizers, electric guitars, electric bass, and in the latter, electronic drums and rhythm machines. Also around the same time, the band's future \\"fourth member\\" Hideki Matsutake was the assistant for the internationally successful electronic musician Isao Tomita. Much of the methods and techniques developed by both Tomita and Matsutake during the early 1970s would later be employed by Yellow Magic Orchestra. Sakamoto first worked with Hosono as a member of his live band in 1976, while Yukihiro Takahashi recruited Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the Sadistic Mika Band. Hosono invited both to work on his exotica-flavoured album Paraiso, which included electronic songs produced using various electronic equipment. The band was named \\"Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band\\" as a satire of Japan's obsession with black magic at the time, and in late 1977 they began recording Paraiso, which was released in 1978. The three worked together again for the 1978 album Pacific, which included an early version of the song \\"Cosmic Surfin\\". Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside Hideki Matsutake in early 1978 for Hosono's experimental \\"electro-exotica\\" fusion album Cochin Moon, which fused electronic music with Indian music, including an early \\"synth raga\\" song \\"Hum Ghar Sajan\\". The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto, experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and traditional Japanese music in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto's songs, \\"Thousand Knives\\", in the album. Thousand Knives was also notable for its early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer, with Matsutake as its music programmer for the album. While Sakamoto was working on Thousand Knives, Hosono began formulating the idea of an instrumental disco band which could have the potential to reach success in non-Japanese-language territories, and invited Tasuo Hayashi of Tin Pan Alley and Hiroshi Sato of Uncle Buck as participants, but they declined. Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi eventually collaborated again to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra and they began recording their self-titled album at a Shibaura studio in July 1978. The band was initially conceived as a one-off studio project by Hosono, the other two members being recruited session musicians--the idea was to produce an album fusing orientalist exotica with modern electronics, as a subversion of Orientalism and exoticization.","completion":"This text is about Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), a Japanese electronic music band.

The researches studied the atmosphere in Antarctica, and close to Greenland. They found out there's an ozone hole over Antarctica. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which landmass had its atmosphere destroyed by chlorine gasses? Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Antarctica Based on the given information and the hint provided, it is evident that the landmass whose atmosphere is being destroyed by chlorine gases is Antarctica. The destruction of the ozone layer, specifically the formation of an ozone hole, is occurring over this region. The ozone layer plays a crucial role in protecting Earth's inhabitants from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, the release of harmful chemicals, like chlorine and bromine, has resulted in the depletion of this essential layer. These chemicals, commonly found in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products, have led to the significant loss of ozone, especially over the Antarctic region. This ozone depletion has various negative consequences for both human health and the environment. Among these are an increased risk of skin cancers and eye cataracts in humans due to heightened UV radiation exposure. Moreover, the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, the death of vital plankton species, and the disturbance of ocean food webs are all detrimental impacts caused by the thinning of the ozone layer. Efforts to reduce the release of pollutants have helped slow down the loss of the ozone layer. However, it is crucial to continue these efforts in order to protect and possibly restore the ozone layer, as its complete loss would be catastrophic for life on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: A federal appeals court has struck down important segments of the FCC's Open Internet rules, determining that the agency doesn't have the power to require internet service providers to treat all traffic equally. The DC circuit court has ruled on Verizon v. FCC, a challenge to the net neutrality rules put in place in 2010, vacating the FCC's anti-discrimination and anti-blocking policies, though it preserved disclosure requirements that Verizon opposed — in other words, carriers can make some traffic run faster or block other services, but they have to tell subscribers. The problem isn't that the court opposed the FCC's goals, it's that unlike older telecommunications providers, ISPs aren't classified as \\"common carriers\\" that must pass information through their networks without preference. By enforcing net neutrality, the court found, the agency was imposing rules that didn't apply to carriers. It's an issue that net neutrality supporters have been worried about for years: \\"The FCC — under the leadership of former Chairman Julius Genachowski — made a grave mistake when it failed to ground its Open Internet rules on solid legal footing,\\" says Free Press president Craig Aaron. \\"Internet users will pay dearly for the previous chairman's lack of political will.\\" \\"We will consider all available options, including those for appeal.\\" Despite striking down parts of the rules, Judge David Tatel said that the FCC should have some authority to regulate service providers. The FCC justified its rules partly by saying that the Open Internet order promotes broadband development, an explicit agency goal. While opponents of net neutrality have said that there's little evidence these rules actually help, Tatel disagreed, saying that the idea was \\"both rational and supported by substantial evidence.\\" Verizon also argued that Congress was responsible for passing regulations, but \\"although regulation of broadband Internet providers certainly involves decisions of great 'economic and political significance' ... we have little reason given this history to think that Congress could not have delegated some of these decisions to the Commission.\\" Notably, Tatel also agreed that striking down net neutrality could have negative effects on consumers. \\"The commission has adequately supported and explained its conclusion that absent rules such as those set forth in the Open Internet Order, broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness and could act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future broadband deployment,\\" he said, saying that broadband companies have \\"powerful incentives\\" to charge for prioritized access or to exclude services that competed with their own offerings. Without net neutrality, \\"broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness.\\" Unfortunately for the commission, the particular rules it tried to make — anti-blocking and anti-discrimination measures — were expressly allowed only for common carriers. Despite the FCC's arguments, Tatel didn't think that the Open Internet rules were more permissive than common carrier standards, nor did he think that internet service providers could be counted as something besides carriers, an argument that could have opened the door to more regulations. FCC chair Tom Wheeler said that the agency would continue the fight, though it's not clear exactly how. \\"I am committed to maintaining our networks as engines for economic growth, test beds for innovative services and products, and channels for all forms of speech protected by the First Amendment. We will consider all available options, including those for appeal, to ensure that these networks on which the Internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expression, and operate in the interest of all Americans.\\" Update: Verizon has responded to the decision, saying that the FCC could no longer \\"impose last century's common carriage requirements on the internet\\" and insisting that service will only get better. ||||| A federal appeals court has struck down the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules, which prohibited Internet providers from blocking or prioritizing Web traffic. The decision on Tuesday is the latest in a lengthy legal battle over whether the FCC can regulate the Internet. In an opinion written by Judge David Tatel, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found that the network neutrality rules contradicted a previous FCC decision that put broadband companies beyond its regulatory reach. \\"Given that the Commission has chosen to classify broadband providers in a manner that exempts them from treatment as common carriers,\\" Tatel wrote, \\"the Communications Act expressly prohibits the Commission from nonetheless regulating them as such.\\" At stake here is an Internet provider's ability to charge Web companies such as Netflix for better service, which public interest advocates say may harm consumers. Verizon led the charge against the FCC's net neutrality order, suggesting in oral arguments last fall that it would like to pursue different service pricing models. \\"I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements,\\" said Verizon lawyer Helgi Walker in September. In a statement Tuesday, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler indicated he was considering an appeal to the decision. \\"We will consider all available options, including those for appeal,\\" Wheeler said, \\"to ensure that these networks on which the Internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expression, and operate in the interest of all Americans.\\" Broadband is currently classified by the FCC as an information service, a category that gives the agency a fairly limited set of regulatory options. If Internet providers were classified instead as common carriers, the FCC's rule would likely stand. In fact, the federal ruling on Tuesday upheld the FCC's net neutrality rules as a matter of principle; the problem is that the agency effectively tried to apply its powers in the wrong context. Faced with this dilemma, the FCC may either choose to argue that its regulations do not fall under the rubric of common carriage, or attempt to reclassify broadband as a common carrier, according to outside observers. Neither path is likely to be easy, as major industry players are likely to resist any attempt to reclassify broadband under Title II of the Communications Act. \\"The reclassification is politically tricky but legally clear,\\" said John Bergmayer, a senior staff attorney at Public Knowledge, which supported the FCC's rule. \\"The other question involves lawyers arguing for hours about what is and isn't common carriage. That's politically easier, but legally more difficult.\\" Denying that the FCC's open Internet order reflects common carriage regulation isn't likely to be a winning strategy, said Tim Wu, the Columbia University law professor who first coined the term \\"net neutrality.\\" That's because the very notion of non-discrimination is central to common carriage, an idea that itself dates back to medieval times. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A federal appeals court has ruled against the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet rules. This means that internet service providers are no longer required to treat all online traffic equally. This decision was made due to internet service providers not being classified as \\"common carriers,\\" which must pass data through their networks without preference.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. and the situation: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. Answer the following question: In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, case B would be less likely to have a genetic disorder.

Step 2: Analyze the impact of mutations on genetic disorders. - Beneficial mutations (case B): These mutations help organisms adapt to their environment and improve protein functionality, which means they are less likely to cause genetic disorders. - Harmful mutations (case C): These mutations often cause proteins to lose their functionality or even be detrimental to the organism, which increases the likelihood of genetic disorders. Step 3: Compare the probabilities of genetic disorders in case B and case C - Case B, with its beneficial mutation, is less likely to have a genetic disorder compared to case C, which has a harmful mutation or no beneficial mutation at all. The beneficial mutation in case B allows the bacteria to resist antibiotics, which suggests that the protein's functionality is improved and less likely to result in a genetic disorder."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the name of the person who supplemented his salary by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1898 the RCM offered Holst a further year's scholarship, but he felt that he had learned as much as he could there and that it was time, as he put it, to \\"learn by doing\\". Some of his compositions were published and performed; the previous year The Times had praised his song \\"Light Leaves Whisper\\", \\"a moderately elaborate composition in six parts, treated with a good deal of expression and poetic feeling\\".Occasional successes notwithstanding, Holst found that \\"man cannot live by composition alone\\"; he took posts as organist at various London churches, and continued playing the trombone in theatre orchestras. In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players. Nevertheless, longing to devote his time to composing, Holst found the necessity of playing for \\"the Worm\\" or any other light orchestra \\"a wicked and loathsome waste of time\\". Vaughan Williams did not altogether agree with his friend about this; he admitted that some of the music was \\"trashy\\" but thought it had been useful to Holst nonetheless: \\"To start with, the very worst a trombonist has to put up with is as nothing compared to what a church organist has to endure; and secondly, Holst is above all an orchestral composer, and that sure touch which distinguishes his orchestral writing is due largely to the fact that he has been an orchestral player; he has learnt his art, both technically and in substance, not at second hand from text books and models, but from actual live experience.\\"With a modest income secured, Holst was able to marry Isobel; the ceremony was at Fulham Register...

Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which child had less chance of developing a chronic infection, child O or child P?

Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3] The answer is:","completion":"Child P had less chance of developing a chronic infection. This is because the risk of developing a chronic Hepatitis B infection decreases as the child gets older.

Context: Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists like Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, John Denver, and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format, such as Richard Marx, Michael Jackson, Bonnie Tyler, George Michael, Phil Collins, and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by AllMusic as \\"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\\".

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the benefit of pollen wasp to plants?\\" Context: \\"Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The benefit of pollen wasps to plants lies in their role as pollinators, which contributes to plant reproduction and the perpetuation of plant species. Pollen wasps, scientifically known as Masarinae, are a subfamily of Vespidae wasps that visit flowers primarily to collect pollen as a food source for their larvae. In the process of gathering pollen, these wasps inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another. This pollen transfer leads to the process of fertilization and sexual reproduction in plants. Pollen wasps exhibit selective behavior towards specific plants, preferring certain species with distinct flower traits. This preference has driven the co-evolution of plants and pollen wasps through mutualistic adaptations. The plants that attract pollen wasps have evolved various adaptive traits, such as vibrant colors (including ultraviolet ones) and specific pheromones that draw the wasps towards them. In return for their pollination services, pollen wasps receive nourishment for themselves and their offspring, as the collected pollen provides vital proteins and nutrients for their larvae. This mutualism exemplifies a symbiotic relationship where both plants and wasps benefit from their interactions: plants ensure successful reproduction, while wasps obtain essential resources for their young. In summary, the benefit of pollen wasps to plants mainly stems from their function as pollinators, transferring pollen and contributing to plant reproduction, while also participating in an intricate mutualistic relationship characterized by co-evolution and adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

Step 1: Identify the properties of electrons - Electrons are subatomic particles that carry a negative electric charge. Step 2: Relate electric charge and spin - In quantum mechanics, intrinsic spin is a property of electrons, making them fermions (spin-½ particles). The spinning motion of a charged particle generates a magnetic field around it. Step 3: Connect the spin of electrons to magnetic moment - The magnetic field generated by the spinning electron interacts with external magnetic fields, and this interaction can be represented by the magnetic moment of the electron. In conclusion, the intrinsic spin of electrons, coupled with their electric charge, produces a magnetic moment. This is a key concept in understanding the magnetic properties of materials and the behavior of electrons in magnetic fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook. Remember not to count your first stitch towards the 60 chains. To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain. Add 3 chains onto the 60 that you already have. This will maintain the height when you start crocheting the following rows. This will effectively count as turning your work, so just continue crocheting the row. To double chain, insert your hook into the fourth chain. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain. At this point, you should have three loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull through two loops on your hook. You should now have one loop on your hook. Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook. To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain. Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row.

Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. skip one stitch and single crochet into the next stitch. Repeat this all the way across. To single crochet, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches. Cut the working yarn, then wrap the tail around your hook and pull it completely through your loop. Wrap and roll your scalloped piece so the scalloped edges face out like petals. Make sure to keep the straight edges lined up as you roll since you'll need to secure them later. Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like.

Fast food customers always want speedy and accurate service. But these attributes are particularly in demand at the drive-thru. After all, the main reason customers swing through the drive-thru rather than venture inside is because they want to stay on the go. And accuracy matters even more with the drive-thru experience because by the time customers realize their orders are screwed up, they could be miles from the restaurant. So which fast food chains have the fastest and most accurate drive-thru service? QSR Magazine, which covers the quick service restaurant industry, conducts an annual survey focused on these and other factors evaluating the drive-thru customer experience. This year’s just-released study is based on nearly 2,000 drive-thru visits at 15 major fast food chains. Here are the results in the categories that matter most to us—speed and accuracy (of course), as well as polite service. Among the 15 fast food chains included in the study, the average drive-thru order was completed in 226 seconds. That’s a little over three minutes, and a four-second increase compared to the results of a similar study conducted one year ago. But some chains were much faster than others. Read Next: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About the Fast Food Drive-Thru Getting those latte orders ready to go certainly seems to take a lot of time: A Starbucks’ drive-thru order takes about 300 seconds, on average, the highest of any chain in the study. Only two chains were under the 200-second mark: Dunkin’ Donuts (181 seconds) and overall speed champ Wendy’s (169 seconds). In the QSR study, Carl’s Jr. employees got drive-thru orders correct 96.7% of the time. That was tops among its fast food peers. Chick-fil-A came in second place, with 94.5% accuracy, and the drive-thrus at Arby’s, Burger King, Hardee’s, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, and Taco Cabana were all above the 90% accurate industry average as well. Wendy’s may have the fastest drive-thru, but perhaps speed comes at the cost of accuracy: Its orders were correct a subpar 86.9% of the time. Panera Bread scored lowest of all in terms of accuracy, getting orders completely right at a rate of only 82.6%. Panera Bread’s drive-thru may not be tops in terms of accuracy, but at least its employees were nice about it. The fast-casual sandwich chain scored very strongly for good service at the drive-thru. The study found that Panera Bread drive-thru workers were above the average for making eye contact with customers, having a pleasant demeanor, smiling, and saying “thank you.” Read Next: Why People Care So Much About McDonald’s One-Minute Drive-Thru Guarantee But Chick-fil-A appears to have the most polite drive-thru employees.

The key focus is on the mutual agreement between U.S. President George Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun to hasten their efforts in deterring North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which poses a significant threat to global peace and stability. The topic interlaces several significant themes including international relations, nuclear disarmament, and geostrategic conflict mitigation. It expounds on the necessity of a collective approach from global actors in managing nuclear weapons proliferation, with an immediate focus on the crisis in North Korea. In context, this issue highlights the frequent tensions within North East Asia, where North Korea's nuclear programs have aroused international concern and condemnation. It also depicts how other nations, especially influential powers such as the U.S. and regional actors like South Korea, strive to address potential conflicts in the nuclear landscape. Furthermore, this also touches on the topic of negotiations or possibly sanction impositions on defiant states. As the U.S. and South Korea agree to \\"accelerate efforts,\\" they may likely be considering a variety of diplomatic or economic actions to put pressure on North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Vampiric dogs for the following movie plot: A Russian road crew accidentally blasts open a subterranean crypt, and the captain of the road crew, fearing looters and criminals, stations a guard near the site. Late in the night, an earthquake shakes loose one of the coffins, which slides down and lands at the feet of the confused guard. Curious as to what has fallen before him, the guard opens the coffin and discovers the body of a dog, impaled by a stake. He removes the stake, which revives the vampiric hound Zoltan. After slaying the guard, Zoltan opens another coffin shaken loose from the crypt, this one holding the body of an innkeeper, Nalder, who once owned the crypt. Zoltan removes the stake from the innkeeper's chest, reanimating the innkeeper. The movie cuts to a flashback of a village in Russia 200 years prior. The dog of an innkeeper saves a woman from being bitten by a bat, Dracula in disguise. Furious over losing his meal to a dog, Dracula bites the woman's savior, turning the dog into a vampire. Now a vampire, the dog turns on its owner, turning the innkeeper into a vampire as well. Back in the present, it appears that Dracula has only one surviving descendant, Michael Drake, a mild-mannered psychiatrist, played by Michael Pataki, who decides to take his wife and children (who are, technically, also Dracula's descendants) on a vacation in his Winnebago, hoping to spend some quality time with his family out in the national forest. Still loyal to the Dracula family, the two vampires travel to the United States, shipping themselves via boat to California. Eventually, Zoltan and company find themselves in the same forest as Michael and his family. Other campers, vacationing with their dogs, discover that their pets are being killed by a strange beast. The deceased animals soon reanimate into vampiric dogs, the minions of Zoltan. Zoltan is killed in the final scene, but a vampire puppy escapes destruction. The answer to this question is:","completion":"What type of creatures does Zoltan, the vampiric hound, turn other dogs into after being accidentally released from a subterranean crypt in the movie where Michael Pataki plays a psychiatrist who is unknowingly Dracula's descendant, and goes on a family vacation in a national forest?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: A predictable BORING album Review: In 1987 everyone got excited because Fleetwood Mac (FM) had returned to the music scene. People thought it was their first album since Rumours. But any FM fan knows that MIRAGE was their first 80's album (aside from FM LIVE in 1980),and MIRAGE is a much better album, but sadly overlooked by many. Now back to TANGO. What's wrong with it? All songs are predictable commercial sounding tracks that lack the charm and appeal of their previous work. If any McVie songs annoyed me, it was the ones on this album. Weak choruses and songs that seemed to have been written in 5 minutes - 'Little Lies' & 'Everywhere'. There's also the bland Buckingham tracks 'Family Man' & 'Big Love'. Nick's 'Seven Wonders' is semi-passable, but like all the reviews said back in 1987 \\"this album is boring\\". Avoid this album at all costs. Answer:","completion":"The customer seems to be dissatisfied with the particular product, in this case, the album. This conclusion is derived from the analysis of multiple points drawn from the customer's review. The customer begins by comparing this product (album) with other albums and indicates a preference for different, earlier work which sets a negative tone for the review. Owing to words like 'predictable', 'commercial sounding', and 'lack' of charm, it indicates significant dissatisfaction with the content of the album. Noteworthy lines such as 'Weak choruses and songs that seemed to have been written in 5 minutes,' clearly express displeasure with the songwriting. Lastly, the closing suggestion to 'avoid this album at all costs' definitively shows the customer's dissatisfaction. Thus, each step in assessing the review helps to affirm the main conclusion that the client is dissatisfied."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Due to quarterback JaMarcus Russell's ineffectiveness, quarterback Bruce Gradkowski would get the start. Oakland would trail in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer got a 1-yard touchdown run. Cincinnati's lead would increase as Palmer got another 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would close out the half with Gradkowski completing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Miller.

But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce... Question: The author gives the example of Mr. Negroponte's cheap computers _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"The author gives the example of Mr. Negroponte's cheap computers to illustrate an innovative approach to addressing the long-term needs of developing countries, particularly focusing on education, rather than solely concentrating on immediate necessities such as food and medicine. Mr. Negroponte's invention highlights the potential impact of affordable technology on empowering children in these countries by providing them access to the internet and educational resources. By emphasizing the importance of education and creative solutions, the author encourages us to think beyond traditional forms of aid and consider other means of assisting individuals in developing nations to find sustainable solutions to their problems.

Article: Over time, the custom of kissing developed as a way for adults to express their love and affection for one another. The roots of this form of affection can be traced back to primitive times, when mothers fondled their children, much as mothers do today. Much later, in the sixth century, society apparently accepted the custom of kissing between adults as an expression of their affection. Not surprisingly, France first accepted kissing in courtship . There, figure dancing was popular, and each dance was sealed with a kiss. The custom of kissing swept from France through Europe to Russia, where Russian nobility loved to imitate the French. Eventually, the kiss was incorporated into marriage ceremonies, and today lip locks couples into sweet matrimony. The custom of kissing today, as well as in ancient times, serves to pay _ to another. Early Romans kissed each other on the mouth or on the eyes to greet one another in a manner they thought to be dignified. One Roman emperor even ranked a person's importance by the body part he was allowed to kiss. He allowed important nobles to kiss his lips, less important ones to kiss his hands, and the least important ones to kiss his feet. In Russia, the highest sign of recognition from the Crown meant a kiss from the Tsar himself. Today, natives of many African tribes pay homage to their Chief by kissing the ground over which he has walked. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

This phenomenon of the contagion effect is observable as the media serves as a catalyst for spreading violent acts, with studies demonstrating a connection between increased media coverage and a shortened lag time between initial crimes and copycat incidents. Consequently, extensive and sensational media coverage has been shown, through empirical evidence, to exacerbate premeditated violence and encourage emulation by providing exposure and attention to the perpetrators. In terrorism cases, a clustering effect can be identified, where increased media attention results in higher rates of similar terror attacks. This connection between media coverage and terror events is further illustrated in Brigitte Nacos' study, \\"Revisiting the Contagion Hypothesis: Terrorism, News Coverage, and Copycat Attacks\\" (2009). Historical events, such as the series of embassy takeovers in the Middle East during the 1970s, reveal how media coverage can encourage terrorists to emulate past actions that gained significant attention. Notable examples of the contagion effect are also evident in the contrasting cases of the Unabomber and Timothy McVeigh, where the Unabomber escalated his parcel-bombing campaign as a response to the media coverage provided to McVeigh's mass murder in Oklahoma City. Ultimately, the claim that can be inferred from this evidence is that the media's extensive coverage of violent crimes and acts of terror fuels emulation, propels clustering effects, and feeds the pathologies of those seeking attention and validation through violence. As a result, reducing media coverage or adopting responsible reporting practices could significantly alleviate the problem of violent crime emulation and limit the proliferation of violence in society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The New York nanny accused of stabbing to death two children she cared for has has been indicted on murder charges today. Six-year-old Lucia Krim and her two-year-old brother, Leo, were killed on October 25 in their Upper West. Side apartment in Manhattan. Their mother Marina Krim found them in a pool of blood in the bathtub when she came home with the victims' three-year-old sister. The nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, remains hospitalized with self-inflicted stab wounds. It is unknown if the 50-year-old, who had housing and financial problems, has a lawyer. Charged: Nanny Yoselyn Ortega, pictured with Lulu Krim, right, and Nessie, left (who was not in the apartment during the attack), has been charged in their murder. Ortega is expected to be arraigned via video. A hearing has not yet been scheduled, according to court documents. It. was revealed last week that on hearing Mrs Krim's screams, the. building's super ran to the family's apartment - with his young son. trailing behind him to confront the horrific scene. As Marina cradled her surviving daughter, Nessie, the father and. son witnessed Ortega apparently attempt to inflict a fatal wound across her throat. Her. wrists had already been slit. Removal men packed up boxes of. the Krims' belongings at the home last week. Sources have suggested the family will not. return to the apartment where Lucia and Leo were. killed. Ortega, Lucia and Leo had been due to meet Mrs Krim and Nessie at a dance studio, but the mother became concerned when they failed to turn up and returned to the home. After learning from the doorman that the. nanny had not left the building, Mrs Krim frantically searched the. apartment and came across the grisly scene in the bathroom. Loss: Lulu and Leo, pictured, each had multiple stab wounds and were pronounced dead in hospital. Happier times: Marina and Kevin Krim, pictured at a 2009 event at Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Ortega's suicide bid failed and she was put in a medically-induced coma. She has now been brought out of this and charged with murder. When. questioned by police for the first time last Saturday, the nanny attempted. to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the. tragedy on her. Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to. do and asked her to do the housework. 'She said. something like, \\"I'm paid to watch the children, not clean up and do. housework\\",' a law-enforcement source said of Ortega’s statements to. police after she woke from the coma. Father: Kevin Krim recounted the magical Manhattan childhood of his two lost children, the happy memories they accumulated before, police said, their trusted nanny murdered them. Family: Lulu is pictured with her father Kevin Krim and mother Marina Krim, who found her children stabbed in the bathtub and their nanny with a slit throat and wrists on the bathroom floor.

(May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Carrie Meeber (Jennifer Jones) leaves her family in a small rural town and heads to Chicago. On the train to Chicago, Charles Drouet (Eddie Albert) approaches her. Although Carrie is reluctant to speak to him, the salesman persists and the two chat until they reach Chicago. Carrie gets off in South Chicago, the slums as Charles Drouet points out, after taking Drouet's business card. In South Chicago, Carrie stays with her sister, who is married and has one child. After an exhausting and fruitless day of job hunting, Carrie looks up Charles Drouet. He not only talks her into having dinner with him at Fitzgerald's, an upscale restaurant, but also gives her 10. Carrie heads to Fitzgerald's to return the money to Drouet. While there she meets George Hurstwood (Laurence Olivier), the manager of the restaurant, who is immediately smitten with her. Carrie ends up moving in with Drouet. He is a big talker but basically harmless. She pressures Drouet to marry her because the neighbors are talking about them. He tries to distract her and invites Hurstwood, whom he had run into by sheer coincidence, into their home. With Drouet's permission, Hurstwood takes Carrie to the theater while Drouet is on one of his many business trips. Hurstwood and Carrie end up spending every free minute together, and the two fall in love. Just before she is about to run off with Hurstwood, she finds out that he is married. She is distraught and confronts Hurstwood, who admits that he is married although terribly unhappy. At the restaurant, Hurstwood cashes up for the night and, by accidentally locking a timed safe, finds himself stuck with 10,000 of his boss's money. He goes home with the money and is initially pleased to find his boss there. He tries to give the money to his boss, but when he learns that his boss intends to...

Solution 2: Try to balance the paper on the cardboard without any kind of adhesive and hope it will magically stick together.

Translate to Finnish","completion":"Ja kaikki tämä johtuu siitä, että Turkin armeija näyttää sanelevan Turkin politiikkaa Kyproksen kysymyksessä. Kyproksen saarella sijaitseva konflikti voi vaikuttaa monimutkaiselta ulkopuolisesta tarkastelijasta, mutta voi nähdä, että Turkin armeijan rooli asiassa on erittäin merkittävä. Tämä johtuu siitä, että armeija on ollut keskeisessä asemassa Turkin politiikassa etenkin siitä lähtien, kun se teki sotilaallisen intervention saarelle vuonna 1974. Turkin sotilaallinen voima on Kyproksen pohjoisosassa siitä lähtien, ja sen läsnäolo on vaikuttanut saaren molempien puolien välisiin suhteisiin. Turkin sotilaallista läsnäoloa Kyproksella jatkuu edelleen tänä päivänä turvatakseen Turkin etuja saarella. Tämä on johtanut voimakkaisiin jännitteisiin Kyproksen kreikkalaisen ja turkkilaisen yhteisön välillä, mikä on hankaloittanut ratkaisun löytämistä saaren jakautumiseen. Turkin armeija haluaa varmistaa, että muiden maiden, kuten Kreikan, Kiinan tai Venäjän, vaikutus saarella ei heikennä sen etuja. Jotkut ovat sitä mieltä, että Turkin armeija on vahvistanut otettaan Turkin politiikasta viime aikoina, erityisesti vuoden 2016 vallankaappausyrityksen jälkeen. Tämän seurauksena ovat tarkastelijat huolissaan siitä, että Turkin ratkaisu Kyproksen konfliktiin muuttuu yhä aggressiivisemmaksi ja kyynisemmäksi. Näin ollen on tärkeää ymmärtää, että Turkin armeija ei ole vain yksi tekijä Kyproksen konfliktin yhtälössä, vaan aikaisempien vuosien kokemuksista johtuen sen merkitystä politiikasta tuskin voidaan vähätellä. On todettu, että Turkin ja Kyproksen välisen konfliktin ratkaisemiseksi on löydettävä poliittinen ratkaisu, mutta Turkin armeijan vaikutusvalta on muodostanut haasteen sellaisen ratkaisun saavuttamiselle. Perusteellinen ymmärrys armeijan roolista ja sen vaikutuksesta Turkin politiikkaan voi auttaa löytämään keinot, jolla molemmat osapuolet voivat ratkaista erimielisyytensä ja päästä rauhanomaiseen yhteisymmärrykseen saaren jakamisesta. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Turkin armeijalla on merkittävä vaikutus Turkin politiikasta Kyproksen konfliktin osalta. Tämä vaikuttaa siihen miten ja millä ehdoillaTurkki ja Kreikka neuvottelevat saaren tulevaisuudesta. Näin ollen on tärkeää ottaa huomioon Turkin armeijan rooli Kyproksen tilanteessa, jotta löydetään keinoja vakauttaa alue ja kääntää negatiivinen suuntaus, joka voi johtaa entistä suurempiin jännitteisiin ja konflikteihin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While all the options provided can be entertaining for kids, playing games stands out as the most comprehensive choice. Here's a brief analysis of each option: 1. Play chess: Chess is a strategic board game that can be an excellent option for kids who enjoy critical thinking and logic. However, it may not suit every child, as some might find it tedious or difficult to understand. 2. Play games: This broad category includes several options for kids - both indoor and outdoor games, video games, board games, and imaginative or role-playing games. With this variety, children can find something suitable for their interests, age, and skill levels while also improving social and cognitive skills. 3. Play basketball: Basketball is a fun and physically demanding sport that can help kids stay active and develop teamwork skills. However, this option may not be ideal for children who prefer non-athletic or indoor activities. 4. Play cards: Playing card games can be an enjoyable way to pass time for kids, encouraging critical thinking, strategy, and social interaction. However, they may not appeal to children who prefer more physical or fast-paced activities. 5. Watch film: Watching a film can be a source of entertainment and may even inspire children's creativity. However, it is a more passive option and may not engage the child's energy and skills as much as the other choices. In conclusion, the answer is \\"play games\\" because it provides the most diverse set of options, allowing kids to find something engaging and enjoyable based on their personal preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The fifth Beatle is an informal title that various commentators in the press and entertainment industry have applied to people who were at one point a member of the Beatles, or who had a strong association with the \\"Fab Four\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr) during the group's existence. The \\"fifth Beatle\\" claims first appeared in the press immediately upon the band's rise to global fame in 1963-64. The members have offered their own beliefs of the \\"fifth Beatle\\": Lennon was critical of individuals who claimed credit for the Beatles' success, including the individual Beatles themselves, saying in his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, \\"I'm not the Beatles. I'm me. George Martin produced nearly all of the Beatles' recordings (except for the Let It Be album, produced by Phil Spector, and the songs \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Free as a Bird,\\" produced by Jeff Lynne) and wrote the instrumental score for the Yellow Submarine film and soundtrack album, and the string and horn (and even some vocal) arrangements for almost all of their songs (with the famous exception of Spector's re-production on Let It Be, and \\"She's Leaving Home\\", which was arranged by Mike Leander). His arrangement of the string octet backing for \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was widely noted. Martin's extensive musical training (which he received at the Guildhall School of Music) and sophisticated guidance in the studio are often credited as fundamental contributions to the work of the Beatles; he was without question a key part of the synergy responsible for transforming a good rock-and-roll group into the most celebrated popular musicians of their era. Writer Ian MacDonald noted that Martin was one of the few record producers in the UK at the time who possessed the sensitivity the Beatles needed to develop their songwriting and recording talent. Martin's piano playing also appears on several of their tracks, including \\"Misery\\" and \\"In My Life\\". Martin himself deflected claims of being the \\"fifth Beatle\\" to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. In 2006, Martin inadvertently strengthened his image as the \\"fifth Beatle\\" by contributing the only piece of new music on the Love soundtrack: a string arrangement on top of George Harrison's solo acoustic demo of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" from Anthology 3. Lennon disparaged Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, \\"[Dick James is] another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some.\\" In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, \\"When people ask me questions about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth.\\" Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on Revolution 9, Lennon said, \\"For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.\\" In a tribute to George Martin after his death, Paul McCartney said \\"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know.\\" Julian Lennon called him \\"The Fifth Beatle, without question\\". According to Alan Parsons (2016), Martin had \\"great ears\\" and \\"rightfully earned the title of \\"Fifth Beatle\\". Is George Martin still alive?","completion":"George Martin was a very important person who helped the Beatles make their music.

But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time. These apps allow people to send picture messages for free--something which previously was quite costly. Research company Informa said that almost 19 billion messages were sent per day using chat apps in 2012, compared with 17. 6 billion SMS texts. And it expects the chat app market to grow t0 50 billion per day by 2014. So does this really mean the end for communication by text? Pamela Clark--Dickson from Informa doesn't think so.

A man who who was fined for refusing to cut back ivy and weeds he let grow on his house for ten years has finally cut them off. Ken Mould, 50, left the plants to grow for so long that the house was virtually hidden from neighbours. It became so overrun that his chimney could not be seen over the foliage. And the wilderness extended so far. forward from the house, in a cul-de-sac in Rugely, Staffordshire, that. the shape of the building could no longer be made out from the pavement. Ken Mould, 50, has finally trimmed the hedge (left) that engulfed his house (right) after ten years. Before: Mr Mould was fined £1,000 by Stafford Magistrates' Court after refusing to trim his home on council orders. After: Ten months on, the house has become visible after Mr Mould cut back the ivy and weeds. But, despite the fact the roof and first-floor windows were entirely hidden under the ivy, Mr Mould continued to live in the house with his wife, Diane, 50. Then, in February this year, he was fined £1,000 at Stafford Magistrates’ Court after ignoring council orders to trim it. Almost a year on, he appears to have finally complied with the order, and the house can now be seen in full. Council. planning officer Mazer Aqbal said Mr Mould had been ordered to get rid. of the ivy from the front of the property, including the windows and. doors. He was also told to remove all vegetation from his garage roof at the back of the house and to clear the front lawn. Despite the fact the roof and first-floor windows were completely covered, the Moulds lived in the house. The family were able to access the house, with the front door visible underneath the foliage. He said: ‘Basically he has been told to make it look how you would expect a house to look - at the moment you can’t tell whether you’re looking at the front or the back of the building.’ The breakthrough will come as a relief to neighbours who have described the 'nightmare' of living next to him and expressed surprise that the couple and their daughter were not embarrassed by its appearance. Neighbours described the nightmare of living on the same street as the father-of-one. James Partridge, 35, said: ‘It’s a relief he’s shaved it off, that was an eyesore to live next to for so long. ‘I don’t know how they lived in there, must have cost a fortune in lighting. ‘The windows were completely obscured, I wonder if he’ll leave it now again or keep it trimmed.’ Then first floor windows in the house are now visible after the plant growth was trimmed this year. One resident, who did not wish to be named, said in February: 'That thing brings down the house prices for all our street - it's an eyesore' One resident, who did not wish to be named, said in February: ‘That thing brings down the house prices for all our street – it’s an eyesore, I don’t know how they can live in there. ‘Whenever I see someone emerge from that mess I do a double take, they must either live in complete darkness or spend a fortune on lighting.

Solve 0 = -7*y - 23 - 5 for y.","completion":"To solve the equation 0 = -7*y - 23 - 5 for y, follow the steps below: Step 1: Simplify the equation First, simplify the equation by combining the constants. In this case, the constants are -23 and -5. 0 = -7*y - 23 - 5 0 = -7*y - 28 Now we have a simpler equation: 0 = -7*y - 28 Step 2: Isolate the variable y In order to isolate the variable y, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation, and the constants on the other side. To do this, add 28 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 28 = -7*y - 28 + 28 28 = -7*y Step 3: Solve for y The last step is to solve for y. Currently, the equation is 28 = -7*y. To get y by itself, divide both sides of the equation by -7: 28 / -7 = (-7*y) / -7 -4 = y So the solution to the equation 0 = -7*y - 23 - 5 is y = -4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords. The artist believes the key to his success is moving away from the hip-hop style that is historically associated with beatboxers, and instead towards electronic music such as grime, dubstep and drum and bass. Scroll down for video. Reeps One, whose real name is Harry Yeff, is famous for his unique ability to create bass music using his vocal chords. 'The electronic influence as a whole completed defined the way I beatbox,' he said.

'I'm so honoured when people tell me \\"you're the reason I started beatboxing\\"'.

Information: - The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force). - The Jagdpanther (German: \\"hunting panther\\") was a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \\"Jagdpanther\\" combined the very powerful 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness. - The Pak 43 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 43 ) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War . The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers , also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank , to the open - top Nashorn , and fully enclosed , casemate - hulled Elefant and Jagdpanther tank destroyers . The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m ( 1,000 yd ) , making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as fewer corrections in elevation were needed . In addition to this , the gun 's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges , even the Soviet IS - 2 tanks and IS chassis - based tank destroyers . The gun 's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) . - The 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 (Kampfwagenkanone \\"fighting vehicle cannon\\") was an 88 mm 71 calibre tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B \\"Tiger II\\" and the 8.8 cm PaK 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design and use albeit not mounted on tanks but rather on tank destroyers or deployed on the field. - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - Nashorn (German \\"rhinoceros\\", pronounced [nashn]), initially known as Hornisse (German \\"hornet\\"), was a German tank destroyer of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis with the Pak 43 heavy anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war's end. - Hornets (insects in the genera Vespa and Provespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellow jackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head and by the rounded segment of the abdomen just behind the waist. Worldwide, there are 22 recognized species of \\"Vespa\\", and three species of \\"Provespa\\", which are unique amongst hornets in being nocturnal. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (\\"Vespa crabro\\"), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America and Northeast Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus \\"Dolichovespula\\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g. baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets. - Essen (Latin: \\"Assindia\\") is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its population of approximately 589,000 makes it the ninth-largest city in Germany. It is the central city of the northern (Ruhr) part of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area and seat to several of the region's authorities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\".

It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. - Rheinmetall AG is an automotive parts supplier and military technology group headquartered in Düsseldorf.

While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding), enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Elefant (German for \\"elephant\\") was a heavy tank destroyer used by German Wehrmacht Panzerjäger during World War II. It was built in small numbers in 1943 under the name Ferdinand after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls that had been produced for the Tiger I tank requirement which was rejected in favour of a Henschel design. - Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875 30 January 1951) was an automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche car company. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, several other important developments and Porsche automobiles.

From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Where does he visit? A geisha house. Answer:","completion":"Title: The Unveiled Path Step 1: Establish the setting and introduce the protagonist The movie is set in modern-day Kyoto, Japan. Our protagonist, Kenji, is a young, introverted historian from Tokyo, researching the hidden history of geisha culture. Kenji has never been to Kyoto before and is unfamiliar with its customs and traditions. Step 2: Present a dilemma or challenge for the protagonist Kenji's unique research is met with disapproval from traditionalists in Kyoto. He is determined to uncover the truth about the city's geisha houses, but he faces numerous obstacles and feels isolated in his pursuit. Kenji is also challenged by a language barrier, as his parents had never spoken Japanese and opted to raise him in English. Step 3: Introduce supporting characters One day, while searching for historical records, Kenji meets a mysterious old man named Yoshi. Yoshi is a retired geisha mentor who holds the key to some of the city's most hidden secrets. Yoshi recognizes Kenji's passion for history and decides to help him navigate the labyrinth of Kyoto's geisha houses. Step 4: Build tension and conflict As Kenji and Yoshi collaborate to uncover the past, powerful figures in Kyoto's society begin to take notice. These figures aim to maintain the status quo and protect their ancestors' reputation. They threaten and intimidate Kenji while he continues to delve deeper into the city's history. Step 5: Develop a relationship between the protagonist and a geisha During his visits to geisha houses, Kenji meets a geisha named Yuki who becomes his guide. They form an unlikely bond based on mutual curiosity and their shared love of history. Yuki reveals personal stories of her life as a geisha, which adds depth and realism to Kenji's work. Step 6: Deepen the plot with new revelations or twists Yoshi discovers a long-hidden document that sheds light on a dark and closely held secret within the geisha community. This information could change public perception and endanger the lives of modern-day geishas if it becomes known. Kenji, Yuki, and Yoshi are faced with a difficult choice: whether to reveal their findings or to protect the geisha community. Step 7: Climax of the movie The powerful figures in Koyto's society attempt to silence Kenji, Yuki, and Yoshi. In a dramatic scene, Yuki's geisha house is raided, and Kenji and Yoshi are captured. The two must rely on their wit and knowledge of the city to escape and protect their research. Step 8: Resolution Having revealed the truth about Kyoto's geisha houses, Kenji and Yuki decide to protect the innocent geishas from public backlash and backlash from the powerful figures. They use their newfound understanding to create a foundation supporting the geisha community, reconciling tradition with modernity and ushering in a new era. Step 9: Denouement Kenji and Yuki become ambassadors of geisha culture, traveling the world to share their findings and promote understanding. Instead of exploiting the geishas, they embrace their unique roles in Japanese history and work to empower the community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether. When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on? Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \\"coffee headache\\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus. The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better. In fact, coffee can really help us _ . A) to go to sleep very fast B) to work for long hours C) not to get ill easily D) not to depend on medicine A:","completion":"The correct answer is B) to work for long hours. Adam's experience with stopping coffee consumption led to withdrawal symptoms because his body had grown accustomed to the caffeine boost it provided. Caffeine is a stimulant that temporarily increases energy levels and improves concentration, allowing individuals to work for extended periods. However, reducing or stopping caffeine intake can lead to headaches, tiredness, moodiness, and difficulty focusing, which Adam experienced. These withdrawal symptoms typically subside within four to five days, and during this period, taking aspirin can help alleviate the headache."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another.

As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt.

As one of the prominent zoos in Scotland's fourth-largest city, Camperdown Wildlife Centre has a history of providing excellent care for various species of animals. With this new addition, the Centre aims to continue its mission of raising awareness and promoting an understanding of wildlife conservation amongst its visitors. The European Wolves The European wolves set to move into their new home in Dundee are also often known as grey wolves (Canis lupus). They are distinguished from the North American grey wolves by subtle genetic and morphological differences. Historically, these fascinating animals roamed a large portion of the European continent, from the British Isles to the Ural Mountains in Russia. However, due to habitat loss and human-related activities, their populations have significantly diminished in recent times. Acting as keystone species, European wolves play a pivotal role in regulating the ecosystems they inhabit by curbing herbivore populations and preventing overgrazing. They are highly adaptable animals, able to survive in different environments, including forests, mountains, and even the outskirts of human settlements. Arriving at Camperdown Wildlife Centre The two European wolves will be transported to the Camperdown Wildlife Centre amidst thorough preparations to accommodate them.

Through the scope and the cross-hairs, we see his target: a young, beautiful blond woman, swimming in a rooftop pool. He follows her with his sights for a moment before pulling the trigger, hitting her in the back. She flails in agony in the water, and the pool slowly fills with her blood as she dies.Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) enters the rooftop pool area as the title cards roll. Harry inspects the dead body and looks up to the probable area of the shooter. He walks down the street to the building and up to the roof. He walks over to where he figures the shooter was stationed, looks down and across the street at the pool. Looking down, Harry finds a shell casing.

Claims British intelligence behind tip-off that led to capture. 'Open offer' to drop case against Government in return for apology and £3. Token payment will 'cost PM price of his latte', say legal supporters. Article:","completion":"Title: Abdel Hakim Belhadj's Quest for Justice: A Token Payment and The Cost of a Latte Introduction: Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a prominent Libyan dissident, has been on a long quest for justice after his harrowing experience in 2004. Detained in Bangkok by U.S. officials and allegedly tortured before being flown to Libya to face imprisonment, Belhadj claims that British intelligence played a significant role in the events leading up to his capture. In a surprising turn of events, Belhadj has made an 'open offer' to drop the case against the British Government, provided they issue an apology and offer a token payment of £3. According to his legal supporters, this seemingly insignificant amount would barely cover the cost of the Prime Minister's latte. How did this saga unfold, and what are the implications? Abdel Hakim Belhadj's Detention and Alleged Torture: In 2004, during a stopover in Bangkok, Thailand, Abdel Hakim Belhadj was taken into custody by U.S. officials based on suspicion of terrorism. He alleges that he was subjected to inhumane treatment during the few days he was held by the U.S., including being tortured. After this horrific ordeal, Belhadj was flown back to Libya where he was subsequently imprisoned. British Intelligence's Alleged Involvement: Belhadj claims that the information that led to his capture was provided by the British intelligence services, making them complicit in his detention and subsequent suffering. These claims have cast an uncomfortable shadow over the British Government and their involvement in the controversial 'War on Terror'. The Open Offer of Settlement: In a recent development, Abdel Hakim Belhadj has offered to settle the case against the British Government in exchange for an apology and a token payment of £3. To put this amount into perspective, Belhadj's legal supporters point out that this would be less than the cost of a latte for the Prime Minister. This unique proposal highlights Belhadj's primary motivation for seeking justice - acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a sincere apology. The Significance of the 'Latte Settlement': What does this 'open offer' mean, and why is it significant? It demonstrates that the true cost of justice is not measured in millions of pounds but in the moral weight that an acknowledgment carries. It illustrates that an apology from the British Government could go a long way in addressing the wrongs done to Abdel Hakim Belhadj, and it places the responsibility squarely on their shoulders to acknowledge their involvement and to right the wrong. Conclusion: The case of Abdel Hakim Belhadj, a Libyan dissident detained and allegedly tortured, raises essential questions about the role played by intelligence services in the global 'War on Terror'. It emphasizes the power of an apology, and the weight it carries in healing wounds that no amount of money can repair. As the British Government grapples with this dilemma, they must assess whether the cost of a latte can usher in a new chapter of transparency and accountability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Please answer this question : Which group had people with stronger immune systems? The answer is:","completion":"Group Y, which had people in their 40s, likely had stronger immune systems. This is based on the hint provided which suggests that as people age, the immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses. It states that stamina, strength, reflex time, sensory acuity, and the number of brain cells all decline during old age, which typically begins in the mid-60s. Therefore, relative to Group D, which consisted of people over 65 years old, Group Y is likely to have stronger immune systems given the younger age of its members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: Okay then... Student:","completion":"Yes, I understand the task. Here's the step-by-step process and justification for translating the given English sentence, \\"Okay then...\\", to Spanish: 1. Identify the keywords in the sentence: In this case, the keywords are \\"Okay\\" and \\"then\\". 2. Find the Spanish equivalents for the keywords: - \\"Okay\\" can be translated to \\"Está bien\\" or \\"Vale\\" in Spanish. Both are commonly used to express agreement or acceptance in Spanish-speaking countries. - \\"then\\" can be translated to \\"entonces\\" or \\"pues\\" in Spanish. Both are used to indicate a consequence or result, similar to the English word \\"then\\". 3. Arrange the Spanish words in the correct order to form a coherent sentence. In this case, we can combine \\"Vale\\" and \\"entonces\\" or \\"Está bien\\" and \\"pues\\" to create the Spanish translation.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Microwave ovens operate by emitting microwave radiation, which is primarily absorbed by water molecules in food. The absorbed radiation is converted to heat through rapid oscillations of polar water molecules, 28. Q: Microwave ovens use radiation to provide food with what kind of energy? A: Answer:","completion":"Microwave ovens use radiation to provide food with thermal energy, which is a form of energy that manifests as heat. This energy is transferred into the food through the interaction between the emitted microwave radiation and the water molecules present in the food. The microwaves emitted by the oven are a form of electromagnetic radiation, which falls within a specific range of frequencies. These frequencies are particularly effective at interacting with polar water molecules found in most foods. Water molecules have a positive and negative end, making them polar, and therefore, they can align with the electric field created by the microwave radiation. As the microwave radiation oscillates, the electric field changes rapidly, causing the polar water molecules to rotate in response. This continuous process of realigning with the oscillating electric field results in the rapid movement of the water molecules. The friction resulting from this movement generates heat within the food, thus heating it up. This process of converting microwave radiation into thermal energy is known as dielectric heating or microwave heating, and it is responsible for the uniform heating observed in microwave ovens. Not only does this contribute to faster cooking times compared to conventional ovens, but it also helps maintain the nutritional content of the food, as longer cooking times can result in nutrient loss. In summary, microwave ovens use radiation to provide food with thermal energy, which is generated by the interaction between microwave radiation and polar water molecules, resulting in the rapid heating of food through dielectric heating."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q:WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Write a summary based on this article: CLAY, N.Y. - Police use DNA to solve murder mysteries and rapes. They used it last year to determine who spat into a customer's soda at a Chili's restaurant in Clay. Related story: 5 tales of angry food servers contaminating the orders they deliver. The state police crime lab compared DNA from some spit that Ken Yerdon found inside his soda with a swab of saliva from the man who had waited on Yerdon at Chili's - Gregory Lamica. The DNA was a match, according to court papers. Lamica was charged with disorderly conduct and pleaded guilty. Yerdon and his wife, Julie Aluzzo-Yerdon, had dinner at Chili's on Route 31 on July 28, as they did about once a week. Lamica, then 24, was their waiter. They had a couple minor complaints - undercooked broccoli and chips not being served, they said. They told Lamica and he seemed annoyed with them, Ken Yerdon said. \\"They were busy -- we understood,\\" Julie Aluzzo-Yerdon said. \\"We were patient with him, but we could tell he was annoyed with us. All Ken said to him was, 'Are you OK? Have we done something to offend you?' And he said, 'Oh, no, no.\\" When they were getting ready to go, the Yerdons told Lamica they wanted to get their drinks refilled and to take them in to-go cups. Lamica brought them the cups, as if he'd expected them to pour the remains of their drinks into the cups, according to a police report. Ken Yerdon told Lamica they wanted him to refill the cups, since the drinks on their table were almost gone, he said. Lamica seemed annoyed again, and took the cups to the back of the restaurant, Yerdon said. On their way out, they Yerdons saw Lamica and noticed that he wouldn't make eye contact, the police report said. Ken Yerdon took two sips from the cup. He wasn't able to see inside because it had a lid and was Styrofoam. As they were driving home, the lid popped off. \\"I saw the spit in the cup,\\" Ken Yerdon told Syracuse.com. \\"It wasn't regular spit either. It was definitely a loogie.\\" Yerdon took a picture of it, dropped his wife and 12-year-old son off at their home in Clay and drove back to Chili's. The managers apologized but did not admit anyone at Chili's was responsible, Yerdon said. They kept the waiter in an office, he said. The managers gave Yerdon coupons and a refund for the meal, he said. But they didn't fire the waiter, the Yerdons said. \\"We just felt like he needed to be terminated immediately,\\" Julie said. \\"To do something like that was so vile and beyond the pale. We couldn't believe it.\\" As he left, Yerdon saw Lamica in the parking lot, according to a state police report. \\"I said, 'Why did you spit in my drink?'\\" Yerdon's statement to police said. \\"He was bawling. He just kept walking with his apron in his hand and he didn't answer me. I said to him, 'You wouldn't be crying if you didn't spit in my drink.' He said, 'I don't want to lose my job.' \\" The Yerdons called the state police. An investigator questioned Lamica at Chili's and he denied spitting in the cup, the Yerdons said. But he agreed to let the trooper take a swab of saliva, they said. Three months later, the DNA results came back. The troopers called Lamica into their barracks and he again denied spitting into Yerdon's drink, according to the Yerdons. Then the troopers confronted Lamica with the DNA results and he confessed, the Yerdons said. Lamica, of Central Square, was charged with disorderly conduct, a violation. He pleaded guilty in February and was sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge and a 125 surcharge, according to Clay Town Court. Lamica no longer works at Chili's, the Yerdons said. But he continued working there for at least three months after the incident, they said. Lamica refused to answer a reporter's questions today. A manager at Chili's could not be reached for comment. The Yerdons plan to sue Lamica and the owners of Chili's this week. They want compensation for the psychological trauma they endured not knowing whether Yerdon had contracted HIV or hepatitis because he'd sipped from the cup twice before seeing the spit. Ken Yerdon, 45, a traveling operator for a power company, tested negative for HIV and hepatitis immediately after the incident. But he had to wait six months to be tested a second time to ensure he was in the clear. \\"It was a long six months of anxiety,\\" Julie Aluzzo-Yerdon said. Marissa Rice, director of youth services at ACR Health in Syracuse, said today that saliva is not one of the four bodily fluids through which HIV can be transmitted. Even if someone had blood in his or her saliva, swallowing that person's saliva would not transmit the disease because it has to get into someone's bloodstream, said Rice, who's trained by the state in AIDS prevention education. The Yerdons' lawsuit, which will be filed by lawyer Robert Lahm in state Supreme Court, claims the company that owns the Chili's restaurant should be held responsible because it took no action against Lamica before he quit in October.

The incident took place last July, when Ken Yerdon and his wife, Julie Aluzzo Yerdon, went to dinner at a Chili's restaurant on Route 31 in Clay, New York, according to court documents from a lawsuit filed Tuesday. The couple complained to their server, Gregory Lamica, then 24, that their food was under-cooked and that they hadn't been served chips, Yerdon said. \\"They were polite to the server, and even left a tip,\\" Robert Lahm, a lawyer representing the Yerdons in the case, told ABC News today. Courtesy Ken Yerdon \\"We weren't rude or anything,\\" Ken Yerdon told ABC News. \\"It was a busy night but we didn't expect for our food to get spit in,\\" he said. Before leaving, the couple asked for to-go drinks and as they drove off, the styrofoam cup's lid popped off, revealing a nasty surprise, Yerdon said. \\"The lid popped off and I looked in and there was some spit in the cup,\\" Yerdon said, noting \\"it was really bad.\\" Yerdon dropped off his wife and 12-year-old son before driving back to the restaurant, where managers apologized and gave Yerdon a refund and some coupons but did not admit Lamica was responsible for the incident, Lahm said. Yerdon said he then ran into a sobbing Lamica in the parking lot, where he asked him why he'd spit in his cup. According to Yerdon, Lamica denied that he had spit in the cup, prompting Yerdon to say \\"you wouldn't be crying if you hadn't spit in my cup.\\" Lamica told Yerdon he didn't want to lose his job, Yerdon recalled, to which Yerdon replied \\"you should have thought of that before you spit in my cup.\\" \\"It's a backstory that everybody thinks about, what the servers do and what's happening in the kitchen,\\" Lahm said. \\"It’s disgusting to think about it.\\" Since Ken Yerdon took two sips of the drink before he saw the spit, he said he decided to get tested for HIV and hepatitis, and in both cases he subsequently tested negative. HIV cannot be contracted through saliva, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several days after the Yerdons called the state police, investigators showed up at Lamica’s door where he denied spitting in Yerdon’s drink but agreed to have his mouth swabbed for DNA, according to state police. Meanwhile, Lamica had not been fired and he continued to work at the Chili's until last October when he left on his own volition, according to court papers. Three months after the incident, DNA analysis concluded the spit in the Yerdon’s cup matched Lamica’s, who was brought into a police station where he confessed to the crime and was charged with disorderly conduct, according to state police. Lamica pleaded guilty in February and was sentenced to a one-year conditional discharge and a 125 surcharge, according to Clay Town Court. The Yerdons filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Lamica, Chili's parent company and the owner of the Chili's for negligence and retention of an incompetent employee. The lawsuit did not specify the damages being sought. Lamica could not be reached for comment by ABC News. \\"Due to company policy and a pending lawsuit, we are waiting to review the case before commenting,\\" a manager at the Chili's in Liverpool, New York, told ABC News today. \\"The behavior of this former employee was an isolated incident and totally unacceptable,\\" a spokesperson for Chili's Grill & Bar said in a statement sent to ABC News. \\"It should not overshadow the more than 100,000 Chili's team members taking great care of our guests every day,\\" the statement said. \\"We won't be going back to Chili's,\\" Yerdon said. ||||| Summary:","completion":"At a Chili's restaurant in Clay, New York, a waiter named Gregory Lamica spat in a customer's soda. The customer, Ken Yerdon, noticed the spit and took a picture of it. He and his wife complained to the managers, but they didn't fire the waiter. So, the Yerdons called the police. The police used DNA from the spit and compared it to a saliva swab from the waiter, and found out it was a match. Lamica, the waiter, was charged with disorderly conduct and pleaded guilty.

They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities.

After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a 100,000 fine by the team. Question: How many field goals did Kasay have?

These places, located in East Asia, are very distinct and different from the United States, which is in North America. While there's the potential that the plant has been introduced and cultivated in the U.S., it would be considered an introduced species rather than a native one. A plant is considered native if it has naturally evolved in the region and its presence is not the result of human activity. The phrasing in the provided paragraph is very clear – \\"native to southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan\\" – leaving no room for ambiguity. This factual assertion provides no geographical connection between the natural distribution of Fatsia Japonica and the U.S. Therefore, based on this specific paragraph, it is incorrect to conclude that Fatsia Japonica is native to the U.S. To accurately identify the native flora of a location, the information should be derived from trustworthy botanical and horticultural sources which document and study plant distribution and can provide the correct taxonomy and origin of a plant species. If the phrase had been different, or if it had mentioned that the plant was also native to regions in the U.S., or simply if the term \\"introduced\\" had been used in relation to the U.S., the conclusion might be different.

Summarize the following: Fold over each of your fabric pieces so that the short ends are lined up and the right sides (print or color sides) are facing each other. Then, sew along the short edges to form each piece into a circle. If you prefer, you can wait to add a seam on the skirt until after you have sewed all of the tiers together. This may be a better option if you are planning to do more than three tiers. Take your top tier piece and fold over about ½” to 1” (depending on the width of your elastic) of fabric of one of the long edges so that the wrong sides (non-print or non-color sides) are facing each other. This will be the waistband of your skirt. Sew along this edge to create the waistband. Make sure to leave enough space to add your elastic in later. Leave a small 1” to 2” gap in the seam to insert the elastic. It is easier to hem the bottom of your skirt before you start to gather your pieces and sew them together. Fold over about ½” of fabric of one of the long edges of the bottom piece (your largest tier). Then, sew along this edge to create the bottom hem. You will be sewing the tiers together, but first you need to gather them. You will start by gathering the bottom tier and sewing it onto the bottom of the middle tier. To gather the bottom tier, sew a baste stitch into the top of the bottom tier (not the edge that you just hemmed). If you want, you can sew a permanent stitch over the baste stitch when it is gathered to your liking. However, sewing the middle tier to the bottom tier will create this permanent stitch, so it is not absolutely necessary to stitch over the baste stitch. Line up the edges so that the right sides of your fabric are facing each other. Then, pin along these edges about ¼” to ½” inch from the edge of the fabric. Be sure to line up the center seams on the bottom and middle tiers. If you did not create the center seam yet, then make sure that the ends are even. You can adjust the gathering before you start pinning the pieces together to make sure that the pieces are the same length. After you have pinned all the way around the pieces, sew the pieces together, removing the pins as you sew. Next, you will need to repeat the baste stitch on the top of your middle tier, but this time you will be gathering the fabric so that it is the same size as your top tier piece. Add your baste stitch and then adjust until the middle tier piece matches your top tier piece. After you have gathered the middle piece to match the top tier piece, begin pinning the wrong sides together. Pin all the way around the pieces and then sew the two pieces together. Make sure that you line up the center seams on the middle and top tiers. Remove the pins as you sew. If you have more than three tiers, then you will need to continue to baste and stitch until you have added all of your tiers. Summary:","completion":"To create a tiered skirt, first fold and sew fabric pieces into circles. Create a waistband by folding one long edge and sewing, leaving a gap for elastic. Hem the bottom piece prior to gathering and sewing tiers together. Gather and sew bottom and middle tiers together, aligning side seams and adjusting lengths as needed. Repeat the process with middle and top tiers, ensuring proper alignment. Sew additional tiers if needed. Finally, insert elastic into the waistband and complete the skirt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Article: It's interesting to see how people make use of the time they spend on public transport in Indian cities like Delhi and Mumbai. In crowded buses and trains people manage to take a short nap and some even reach the snoring stage. Or they spread out a newspaper over multiple knees and arms to read about the latest sport results or political crisis. Then there are the experienced travellers who have been playing cards with the same group over the last decade or so. They even have their specific seats so well-worn that you can make out the shape of their backsides. There is no doubt about it. Travelling by public transport is being in the thick of the seasons of life -- a sweaty life in summer where people, blissfully unaware of the rivers of sweat running down their brows and inside their clothes. At the first smell of a perfumed man or woman boarding the stuffy bus or train, most people feel they are reborn. During the rains you can't avoid getting wet or muddied. The windows, almost always, are not a perfect fit and if you're not drenched by a sudden, heavy rain shower then you are bound to catch a jet spray of muddy water caused by a fellow motorist driving fast through a puddle. Rains are a perfect time for people to switch their old umbrellas for new ones. Since there are so many that look alike, it's impossible to tell whose is whose. Winter is the time when it feels good -- or at least warm -- to be part of a crowd. It is amazing how much the collective breaths of a 100 or so people can raise the freezing temperature inside. Looking at the masses dressed in their bright red pullovers or green coats, it's fun to imagine what faces lie beneath their dark woolen hats. The cold winter passes, making way for spring. It is impossible not to see every little flower by the wayside blooming proudly. And the warm sun manages to transmit some of their pleasantness to the inside of a bus or train. Now, wouldn't it be perfect if we had a public transport worth the name in all our cities? Question: On Indian public transport, you can always expect to see people _ .

Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose closing mouth happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide exhaled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If a person's mouth is closed during the process, it will not directly affect the overall mechanism of taking in oxygen, breaking down glucose, and producing carbon dioxide. However, there will be an indirect effect on the exhalation of carbon dioxide. When the mouth is closed, the individual will have to rely solely on their nose to exhale the carbon dioxide. This might slightly restrict the airflow and rate at which CO2 is eliminated from the body. The overall effectiveness of the process can still occur, but it might be slower and less efficient due to the restricted airflow.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts.

These questions and activities can be adapted to accommodate students of different grade levels and learning styles. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Black History Month: Engaging Students in the Rich History, Culture, and Achievements of African-Americans Introduction: Black History Month in February presents an opportunity for educators to engage students in an exploration of the central role of African-Americans in shaping the United States' history, culture, and achievements. This month-long celebration helps students understand the importance of diversity, perseverance, and the immense contributions made by African-Americans across various fields. Here is a comprehensive article outlining questions and activities that can be adapted to accommodate students of different grade levels and learning styles during Black History Month. Starting With Essential Questions: One effective way to engage students in this topic is by beginning with essential questions that encourage them to think deeply about the experiences and accomplishments of African-Americans. Some examples include: 1. Why is it essential to learn about and recognize African-American history and culture? 2. How have African-American accomplishments and contributions shaped America in various fields like science, sports, literature, arts, politics and social activism? 3. What are some challenges African-Americans have faced throughout history, and how did they overcome them? 4. How can we honor and celebrate Black history throughout the year, not only during February? Activities for Exploring Black History: 1. Timeline of African-American History: Divide students into groups and assign each group a specific time period, covering significant events in African-American history. Have them create a visual timeline, researching and presenting those events to the rest of the class. 2. Biography Study: Ask students to select a prominent African-American from history or contemporary times. They should research their chosen person's life, achievements, and challenges faced, culminating in a presentation or essay on how they contributed to the rich tapestry of African-American history. 3. Music and the Civil Rights Movement: Encourage students to explore the role of music in the Civil Rights Movement. Have them listen to songs from that era, analyzing lyrics and discussing how these songs reflected the feelings and experiences of African-Americans. Students can create their own songs or poems inspired by the music that moved a generation. 4. African-American Innovators in Science: Engage students in the impact of African-American scientists and inventors like George Washington Carver, Charles R. Drew, and Katherine Johnson. Assign research projects, encouraging students to present on each person's accomplishments and how those inventions or discoveries have improved people's lives. 5. Reading African-American Literature: Introduce students to African-American authors like Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, and James Baldwin. Encourage them to read their works aloud and facilitate discussions about the themes and ideas expressed in those writings. 6. African-American Art Appreciation: Organize a visit to a local museum or art gallery showcasing African-American art or conduct a virtual tour highlighting renowned African-American artists like Jacob Lawrence, Faith Ringgold, and Romare Bearden. Discuss the symbolism and stories within their artwork. 7. Film Analysis: Screen films by African-American filmmakers such as Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay, or Ryan Coogler. Facilitate discussions on representation, storytelling, and themes present in these movies, helping students better understand different aspects of African-American experiences. Conclusion: As educators, it is essential to address various aspects of African-American history, culture, and achievements throughout the school year, not just during Black History Month. Creating an inclusive and engaged learning environment enables students of all backgrounds to develop a deeper appreciation of this rich history. By incorporating these questions and activities into their lesson plans, teachers can cultivate students' critical thinking skills and foster a positive relationship with the diverse tapestry of American history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We did tip our bus boy 10 though and let me tell you why. I had truly high hopes for this so-called 'classic' Vegas restaurant, but I was just disappointed. We were quickly assisted in finding seats as soon as we walked in. We had to move to another table because the table we were given was very wobbly. It was weird that they kind of expected us to deal with that, instead of finding a solution and just leaving the table that way. I told them I was clumsy and that I needed a different table. Our bus boy was great and refilled our drinks several times. It was kind of cute that they were in mason jars. Our waitress, however, was unacceptable. While she was taking our order, she left in the middle of my man talking to speak to another customer just walking in. She came back 30 seconds later and didn't even apologize for interrupting him. The worst part was that she got our order wrong. We were going to get it corrected, but ended up deciding not to. They would probably going to mess that up too and we didn't want to deal with her any longer. I did, however, ask for the smothered gravy sauce that she failed to bring us for our smothered gravy chicken. She came to our table irritated and said \\"sorry\\", in a very unapologetic matter, as if it was our fault she forgot to bring it. She didn't check on us the entire meal, unlike the other waiting staff there. The only time she was polite, was when she brought us our check, which we had to have another employee get for us since she was not around.

The JetBlue pilot arrested after an apparent midair meltdown last week was ordered held without bond during a brief appearance before a federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, on Monday morning, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The U.S. magistrate ordered that Clayton Osbon, 49, be held in the Randall County jail until a detention hearing to determine his bond on Thursday, the prosecutor's spokesman said. Osbon, the captain of JetBlue Flight 191, has been in custody at a hospital where he has been treated since last Tuesday, when he was arrested and later charged with interfering with a flight crew. His remarks and erratic behavior on the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas led the co-pilot to lock Osbon out of the cockpit, according to a federal criminal complaint. Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the cockpit door so hard that the first officer thought Osbon would come through, the document said. The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who was his co-pilot. \\"Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,\\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. \\"When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried.

Question: How could computers connect to the internet? Context: In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet. The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer. Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer. Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous. In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally. A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information. \\"Wireless\\" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments.

The signings come as the club aims to secure a stronger position in the league and solidify their team in the upcoming matches. Body: Lincoln City, currently competing in the National League, have made significant moves to reinforce their team by signing Riccardo Calder and Ross Etheridge on loan deals, spanning till the end of the season. This move exemplifies the club's intent to strengthen their presence in the league and obtain valuable players that possess the skill and versatility required to elevate the team's performance. Riccardo Calder, a 22-year-old Aston Villa midfielder, has demonstrated exceptional talent and promise throughout his career. Following a fruitful loan spell at Doncaster Rovers between 2015 and 2016, Calder went on to spend time loaned with various clubs, including Inverness Caledonian Thistle and more recently, Bradford (Park Avenue) in the National League North. The addition of Calder to Lincoln City's midfield will provide the necessary boost the club needs in terms of creativity and vitality on the pitch.

Possessing a wealth of experience in the lower leagues, Etheridge will undoubtedly be a reliable asset to the Lincoln City squad. The signings of Calder and Etheridge demonstrate Lincoln City's dedication to continuously improving their team and ensuring that they remain competitive in the highly contested National League. This move also highlights the club's ambition to steadily climb up the league table and, in the long term, secure a promotion to higher divisions. Conclusion: In conclusion, the loan signings of Riccardo Calder and Ross Etheridge by Lincoln City signify a positive step for the club in achieving their goals. By successfully bolstering their midfield and goalkeeping positions, the team is well on its way to realizing its potential and climbing higher up in the league standings.

He had reportedly received an advance of 250,000 for the book that was set to be published by Simon & Schuster's conservative imprint Threshold Editions. “After careful consideration, Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos,\\" the publisher said in a brief statement. Yiannopoulos confirmed the news on Facebook. \\"They canceled my book,\\" he wrote. Later he added: \\"I've gone through worse. This will not defeat me.\\" Advertisement Update at 3 p.m.: The American Conservative Union gave in to pressure and decided to rescind the invitation it had extended to Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at this week's Conservative Political Action Conference. Apparently all the horrific things he has said before were acceptable, but Yiannopoulos’ seeming endorsement of at least some types of pedophilia is where the ACU draws the line. “Due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia, the American Conservative Union has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference,” ACU head Matt Schlapp said in a statement on Twitter. “We continue to believe that CPAC is a constructive forum for controversies and disagreements among conservatives, however there is no disagreement among attendees on the evils of sexual abuse of children.” \\"@ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017.\\" pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C — Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017 Yiannopoulos will of course get lots of free publicity out of this and has told the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza he still plans to go to Washington. I just got off the phone with Milo Y. He was unaware of this decision and said he's probably still coming to DC. https://t.co/YxCAjLyC7I — Ryan Lizza (@RyanLizza) February 20, 2017 Original post: It was an eventful few days for Milo Yiannopoulos, the Breitbart editor who likes to describe himself as a provocateur. First, he sparked a disturbing bromance with Bill Maher on HBO, then he was invited to speak at this week’s Conservative Political Action Conference, and to round up the weekend, videos were released in which the self-described “virtuous troll” defends pedophilia and jokes about sexual abuse by members of the clergy. Advertisement Although the videos weren’t new, they were repackaged and published on Twitter by a conservative account clearly critical of the CPAC invite. The videos show how Yiannopoulos played down the importance of child abuse—“You can get quite hung up on this child-abuse thing.” He then goes on to say that sexual relations between “younger boys” and older men could be part of a “coming-of-age relationship” in which “those older men help those young boys discover who they are.” When an unnamed person suggests that Yiannopoulos was advocating for something that “sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me,” the Breitbart editor suggested that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. “But you know what? I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.” He later seems to suggest that sexual relations with a 13-year-old isn’t necessarily pedophilia: You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet who have not gone through puberty. Here is the uncut 5 minute video of Milo Yiannopoulos advocating for Pederasty involving \\"13 Year old\\" and \\"older men.\\" HIS WORDS.@Mschlapp pic.twitter.com/mAgmfpuyvu — The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 20, 2017 In an earlier interview with comedian Joe Rogan, Yiannopoulos also seemed to try to normalize pedophilia, denying that “Father Michael” was a “terrible person,” adding: “It wasn’t molestation.” He later asked Rogan: “So you’re saying you’ve never seen a 15-year-old girl, at any point in your life, that you thought was hot?” Yiannopoulos took to Facebook to defend himself, denying he ever defended pedophilia and suggesting this was all a Republican-led campaign to discredit him: I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst. There are selectively edited videos doing the rounds, as part of a co-ordinated effort to discredit me from establishment Republicans, that suggest I am soft on the subject.

The American Conservative Union has now rescinded its invite for Milo to speak at CPAC – a major gathering of prominent conservatives – as the outrage grows over the videotaped comments about 13-year-old boys and older men. Yiannopoulos resigned from the conservative site Breitbart on February 21, and Simon & Schuster cancelled his upcoming book. Milo held a press conference at 3 p.m. on February 21 in New York City. Watch it here. He admitted he made “outrageous” statements but said he was being targeted unfairly. He apologized to “other victims of abuse” for his comments and pledged to continue advocating for free speech. He also said he has an upcoming new media venture planned, and he revealed he was molested when he was underage by two men. What did he say, though, in the video that provoked the outrage in the first place? Here’s the full transcript of the video making the rounds on social media. The comments were made on the Drunken Peasants podcast. (Spots with a “…” indicate where people talked over each other or it was unintelligible. Otherwise, this is the word-for-word transcript of what Milo said.) Milo: “This is a controversial point of view I accept. We get hung up on this kind of child abuse stuff to the point where we’re heavily policing even relationships between consenting adults, you know grad students and professors at universities.” The men in the joint video interview then discuss Milo’s experience at age 14. Another man says: “The whole consent thing for me. It’s not this black and white thing that people try to paint it. Are there some 13-year-olds out there capable of giving informed consent to have sex with an adult, probably…” The man says, “The reason these age of consent laws exist is because we have to set some kind of a barometer here, we’ve got to pick some kind of an age…” Milo: “The law is probably about right, that’s probably roughly the right age. I think it’s probably about okay, but there are certainly people who are capable of giving consent at a younger age, I certainly consider myself to be one of them, people who are sexually active younger. I think it particularly happens in the gay world by the way. In many cases actually those relationships with older men…This is one reason I hate the left. This stupid one size fits all policing of culture. (People speak over each other). This sort of arbitrary and oppressive idea of consent, which totally destroys you know understanding that many of us have. The complexities and subtleties and complicated nature of many relationships. You know, people are messy and complex. In the homosexual world particularly. Some of those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can’t speak to their parents. Some of those relationships are the most -” It sounds like Catholic priest molestation to me, another man says, interrupting Milo. Milo: “And you know what, I’m grateful for Father Michael. I wouldn’t give nearly such good head if it wasn’t for him.” Other people talk. Oh my God, I can’t handle it, one man says. The next thing in line is going to be pedophilia…says another man. Milo: “You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13-years-old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet. Who have not gone through puberty. Who are too young to be able (unclear and cut off by others)…That’s not what we are talking about. You don’t understand what pedophilia is if you are saying I’m defending it because I’m certainly not.” Another man said, “You are advocating for cross generational relationships here, can we be honest about that?” Milo: “Yeah, I don’t mind admitting that. I think particularly in the gay world and outside the Catholic church, if that’s where some of you want to go with this, I think in the gay world, some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys. They can even save those young boys, from desolation, from suicide (people talk over each other)… providing they’re consensual.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos has faced numerous setbacks after a video in which he appears to defend pedophilia was published on Twitter.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Borghese Collection is a collection of Roman sculptures, old masters and modern art collected by the Roman Borghese family, especially Cardinal Scipione Borghese, from the 17th century on. It includes major collections of Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, and of ancient Roman art. The Borghese also bought widely from leading painters and sculptors of his day, and Scipione Borghese's commissions include two portrait busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Most of the collection remains intact and on display at the Galleria Borghese, although a significant sale of classical sculpture was made under duress to the Louvre in 1807. - Villa Borghese is a landscape garden in the naturalistic English manner in Rome, containing a number of buildings, museums (see Galleria Borghese) and attractions. It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana (\\"Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill\\"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a \\"villa suburbana\\", a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century. - The Madonna and Child with St. Anne ( Dei Palafrenieri ) is one of the mature religious works of the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio , painted in 1605 - 1606 , for the altar of Archconfraternity of the Papal Grooms ( Italian : Arciconfraternita di Sant'Anna de Parafrenieri ) in the Basilica of Saint Peter . The painting was briefly exhibited in the parish church for the Vatican , the church of Sant'Anna dei Palafrenieri on the Via di Porta Angelica in Borgo , near the Vatican . It was subsequently sold to Cardinal Scipione Borghese , and now hangs in his palazzo ( Galleria Borghese ) , where it shares space along with five other Caravaggios : Boy with a Basket of Fruit , David with the head of Goliath ( attributed to 1606 ) , Young Sick Bacchus , Saint Jerome Writing , and St John the Baptist in the Desert . While not his most successful arrangement , it is an atypical representation of the Virgin for its time , and must have been shocking to some contemporary viewers . The allegory , at its core , is simple . The Virgin with the aid of her son , whom she holds , tramples on a serpent , the emblem of evil or original sin . Saint Anne , whom the painting is intended to honor , is a wrinkled old grandmother , witnessing the event . Flimsy halos crown the upright ; the snake recoils in anti-halos . Both Mary and Jesus are barefoot ; Jesus is a fully naked uncircumcised child . All else is mainly shadow , and the figures gain monumentality in the light . If this painting was meant to honor the grandmother of Christ , it is unclear how the ungracious depiction of her wrinkled visage in this painting would have been seen as reverent or iconic . Further shock must have accrued , as stated by Bellori , at the Virgin Mary 's revealing bodice . One could speculate that the parallel diagonals of Jesus '' phallus and leg suggest that both battle the snake , with one its metaphorical equal . - The Galleria Borghese (English: Borghese Gallery) is an art gallery in Rome, Italy, housed in the former Villa Borghese Pinciana. At the outset, the gallery building was integrated with its gardens, but nowadays the Villa Borghese gardens are considered a separate tourist attraction. The Galleria Borghese houses a substantial part of the Borghese collection of paintings, sculpture and antiquities, begun by Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the nephew of Pope Paul V (reign 16051621). The Villa was built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese himself, who used it as a \\"villa suburbana\\", a party villa at the edge of Rome.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

With their wits, courage, and unexpected help from some passengers, they must unravel a deadly plot and save everyone on board from certain doom. Plot: Pete Nessip, a dedicated U.S. Marshal, decides to take a much-needed vacation with his brother Terry, a skilled air marshal. They board Oceanic Flight 227, a commercial airliner set to travel from Los Angeles to New York City. En route, the captain announces that they have received a threatening message from an unknown source: everyone on board will die unless the U.S. government meets a list of exorbitant demands. As fear and panic take hold, all communication systems on the plane are suddenly disabled, leaving the passengers and crew isolated from the outside world. With everyone's life at stake, Pete and Terry spring into action. They quickly form a close-knit team with Sasha, a quick-thinking flight attendant, and Dr. Harper, an airplane-enthusiast surgeon on board. Together, they assess the situation and start investigating the reasons behind the threat. Through collective efforts, the team discovers that the mastermind behind the threat is Victor Harris, a businessman with a hidden agenda. Harris had orchestrated a pharmaceutical-related heist during the layover at the Los Angeles airport and aims to get away with vials of a top-secret experimental serum. The serum grants its user temporary but extraordinary abilities, and it is on the verge of being sold to a foreign power, which could tip the scales of global power. Harris has an accomplice on board – the co-pilot, who helps him control the plane and keep the passengers and crew in fear. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Pete, Terry, Sasha, and Dr. Harper devise a plan to reveal the co-pilot's betrayal and stop Harris. The climax is a harrowing series of events, involving adrenaline-pumping fights, split-second decisions, and narrow escapes. Pete uses his marshal skills to confront and capture the co-pilot, while Terry, Sasha, and Dr. Harper manage to outsmart Harris and secure the vials of serum. Despite the odds, the team of unlikely heroes successfully thwarts the evil plot and safely lands the plane in New York City. United States government officials take custody of the serum and arrest Harris, restoring peace to those aboard Flight 227.

Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works. One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \\"child\\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress.

Problem:Abstract: Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA, NSC 95580) has been demonstrated to be the most effective of the known and studied polar-planar compounds at inducing differentiation in a wide variety of leukemic and nonleukemic cell lines. Although HMBA demonstrated no antineoplastic activity in preclinical testing, it was selected for clinical development on the basis of its potent differentiating capabilities in vitro. In this phase I study, HMBA was administered as a continuous five-day infusion every 3 weeks to patients with advanced cancer. Twenty-three patients received 35 evaluable courses at doses that ranged from 4.8 to 33.6 g/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities included renal insufficiency, a hyperchloremic metabolic acidemia/acidosis, and CNS toxicities manifested by agitation and delirium, which progressed to coma in one patient who developed concomitant renal insufficiency. Moderate myelosuppression, mucositis, nausea, and vomiting were also observed. The pharmacokinetics of HMBA best fit a single compartmental model and disposition is primarily by renal elimination. Renal excretion of HMBA and of the primary metabolite, 6-acetoamidohexanoic acid, together account for the disposition of 66% to 93% (mean, 74%) of the infused drug. Based on this trial, the maximum tolerated and recommended phase II doses for HMBA administered on this schedule are 33.6 and 24 g/m2/d, respectively. However, since steady-state HMBA levels at these doses were in the range of 1 to 2 mmol/L, only approaching the lower limit demonstrated for in vitro differentiating effectiveness, and because of evidence suggesting that the exposure period is an important variable in the induction of differentiation, additional studies examining longer periods of infusion are warranted.

The term \\"apparently\\" indicates that this is the impression that has been given or perceived based on available evidence. As a result, she either has no memory or is struggling to remember what happened. The conclusion \\"She could remember exactly what happened to the other people\\" contradicts the original statement. This conclusion implies that she has a clear and precise memory of the events that occurred to the other individuals, which opposes the idea that she cannot recall or remember those events. To reach a logical conclusion, one needs to keep the main idea of the given statement consistent. In this case, the central theme is that the individual is unable to remember or recall what happened to others. A more accurate conclusion, based on the given statement, could be: \\"She was struggling to piece together the events that occurred to the other individuals\\" or \\"Her memory of what happened to the other people was unclear or fragmented.\\" In conclusion, based on the given statement that \\"She apparently couldn't recall what happened to the others,\\" we cannot infer that \\"She could remember exactly what happened to the other people.\\" Instead, we should focus on conclusions that maintain consistency with the idea of her memory being unclear or incomplete regarding events related to other individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Following the high-scoring loss to the Packers, the Vikings, continuing with Christian Ponder as their quarterback, travel to Arlington, Texas to face the Dallas Cowboys. The first quarter was all field goals, as Dallas scored first with a 41-yarder by Dan Bailey, followed by a 23-yarder for the Vikings by Blair Walsh. In the second quarter, Bailey made another field goal from 44 yards to put the Cowboys up by 3, but the Vikings took a 10-6 lead into halftime, capping the ensuing 79-yard drive with a 6-yard run by Ponder. After the half, Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo completed two consecutive 26-yard passes to tight end Jason Witten to give them an early touchdown and restore their three-point lead. On the very next play from scrimmage, Ponder fumbled the ball as he was sacked in the end zone, and the Cowboys' Nick Hayden recovered it for a touchdown, meaning the Vikings went from 10-6 up to 20-10 down in the space of two scrimmage plays. The Vikings responded immediately with a quick, six-play drive, culminating with a 31-yard pass from Ponder to Kyle Rudolph to cut the Cowboys' lead back to three points. After a series of punts going into the fourth quarter, Adrian Peterson scored for the Vikings with an 11-yard run with almost six minutes to go, but Walsh pushed the extra point kick wide right, giving the Vikings a three-point lead over the Cowboys. Vikings cornerback A. J. Jefferson intercepted Romo on the Cowboys' ensuing drive, putting the Vikings in a position to potentially take over the game, but the offense went three-and-out and was forced to punt. The Cowboys progressed downfield quickly, never faced with a third down, and scored with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Dwayne Harris, the third time the Vikings had given up a game-winning score in 2013.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Epiphyte is the name applied to the class of plants which typically do not root in the soil but, rather, attach themselves to trees or other tall objects where they can obtain light and moisture. Hypothesis: An epiphyte does not need soil to grow.","completion":"After a careful analysis of the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis, \\"An epiphyte does not need soil to grow,\\" is true. According to the paragraph, an epiphyte refers to a distinct group of plants that generally do not root in the soil. Instead, these plants adapt and thrive in their environment by attaching themselves to trees or other tall objects, which can provide essential access to light and moisture resources that are required for growth and sustenance. This distinct characteristic that sets epiphytes apart from other terrestrial plants, whose roots absorb nutrients and water from the soil. By contrast, epiphytes have evolved specialized structures, such as aerial roots, to absorb nutrients and moisture directly from the atmosphere or from fallen debris and rainwater that collects on the surface of their host structures. Some epiphytes also have a mutualistic relationship with other organisms, which provide necessary nutrients. Epiphytes can be found in diverse ecosystems, including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and arid environments. Some well-known examples of epiphytic plants include various species of orchids, bromeliads, and ferns. Their ability to grow without soil is not only a testament to their remarkable adaptability but also plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and contributing to the overall health and functionality of ecosystems in which these plants are found. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph and further knowledge about epiphytes' unique characteristics, it can be affirmed that the hypothesis, \\"An epiphyte does not need soil to grow,\\" is indeed true. These plants have evolved specialized strategies to obtain essential resources such as light, moisture, and nutrients without depending on soil for survival, showcasing their incredible adaptability to various environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A Nobel Prize is considered by most people one of the highest international honours a person can receive. As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given. Answer:","completion":"Question: Which of the following statements about the Nobel Prize is NOT true?

Trump has maintained he'd like to speak with investigators, but his lawyers have voiced concerns he could perjure himself. Giuliani earlier this month rejected Mueller's latest offer for interview terms, which included limiting questions about potential obstruction of justice.

Chris Christie said Sunday. Fox News confirmed Saturday that McGahn had met several times with federal investigators, amid a New York Times report that the sit-downs totaled more than 30 hours over nine months. Christie specifically called out former Trump attorneys Ty Cobb and John Dowd for failing to invoke executive privilege and initially cooperating with investigators, which he said had forced McGahn's hand and exposed the president to legal jeopardy. \\"This shows what a C-level legal team the president had, in Ty Cobb and John Dowd,\\" Christie said on ABC's \\"This Week.\\" Cobb and Dowd had broadly pursued a strategy of cooperation with the special counsel's probe, saying the administration had nothing to hide. But, Christie charged, once Cobb and Dowd waived the president's legal privilege that shielded him from investigators' document requests, they effectively prevented the president's future lawyers from legally using that privilege in the future. \\"You never waive that. Absolutely not,\\" Christie added, referring to the executive and attorney-client privileges which could have barred investigators significant access to Trump administration officials and documents. \\"And it put Don McGhan in an impossible position. Once you waive that privilege and you turn over all those documents, Don McGahn has no choice then but to go in and answer everything, answer every question they can ask him. \\"That wasn't in the president's interest,\\" Christie continued. \\"If he had gotten good legal advice at the time, he would've done something else. It's bad legal advice, bad lawyering, and this is the result of it.\\" Meanwhile, Alan Dershowitz told \\"Fox & Friends\\" on Sunday that McGahn probably did not have attorney-client privilege with Trump, because he represents the White House, not the president himself. But on the executive privilege issue, Dershowitz said Cobb and Dowd had made a \\"tough call,\\" but a reasonable one that simply did not work out. TRUMP ATTY RUDY GIULIANI: MUELLER DOES NOT HAVE A 'LEGITIMATE' INVESTIGATION A source reached by Fox News played down the Times article, saying that there didn’t seem to be anything revelatory in the report’s information and adding that it was already known that Trump had instructed McGahn to cooperate with Mueller’s team. Trump himself on Sunday tweeted that McGahn isn't \\"a John Dean type 'RAT,'\\" referring to the Watergate-era White House attorney who turned on Richard Nixon. And John Dowd, Trump’s former lead outside attorney, told Fox News that “Don McGahn was a very strong witness for the president.” The Times report comes amid pressure from Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, for Mueller to conclude the monthslong investigation. Speaking on Fox News' \\"Sunday Morning Futures,\\" Giuliani pressed for Mueller to wrap up the probe and said McGahn couldn't have revealed any significantly damaging information about Trump -- because that would imply he was complicit in wrongdoing. \\"The New York Times uses very, very deftly the idea that he cooperated extensively -- well, sure he did,\\" Giuliani said. \\"It's a complicated thing. But we are confident that he said nothing wrong about the president, and we're confident because the man [McGahn] is a man of integrity, and he would have resigned if something like that would have happened.\\" Giuliani turned to ex-CIA Director John Brennan, whose security clearance was revoked by President Trump last week. Brennan, who has accused Trump of \\"treason,\\" on Sunday floated the idea of suing Trump for the move -- and Giuliani said he'd love to see him try. \\"Well, then we take his deposition right away,\\" Giuliani said. \\"I’d volunteer to do that case for the president. I'd love to have Brennan under oath. ... We'll find out about Brennan, and we'll find out what a terrible job he did -- going back to being the head of mission when the Khobar Towers were bombed and our Marines were killed, or we can see what he did or said about Benghazi.” The White House has accused Brennan of misleading Congress about CIA spying in the Senate, as well as improperly politicizing his security clearance. Speaking separately on NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\" Sunday, Giuliani attracted criticism online for telling host Chuck Todd that \\"truth isn't truth,\\" as part of his argument that federal investigators can sometimes catch witnesses in so-called \\"perjury traps\\" even when they are telling the truth, as long as they can find other witnesses who dispute their claims. Todd responded: \\"This is going to become a bad meme.\\" Fox News' Elizabeth Zwirz contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, has argued that an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller could result in a perjury trap for the president, as he claims that \\"truth isn't truth.\\" Giuliani emphasized that he would not rush Trump into testifying to avoid potential perjury charges.

Each instance consists of a five-sentence story. The premise is the first sentence of a story, and the second sentence, which is the initial context, provides more information about the story's context. The original ending is the last three sentences of the story. Also, you are given a new ending that can provide the new story with the same premise. You should write a counterfactual context to explain the small differences between the original and new endings. More specifically, a story context contains the general plot of the story. And a counterfactual context is a slight modification to the initial context. To sum up, you should write the second sentence of a story based on the premise(first sentence) and the new ending(last three sentences) of the story.

It sets the scene for the rest of the story. It indicates the occurrence of an important event during the narrator's childhood. Part #2: Getting the Initial Context Usage: The initial context here is \\"We lived in Dallas at the time, so we had to move far away.\\" It gives us key information about where the story starts - in Dallas - and that a move was necessary due to the father's new job. Part #3: Knowing the Original Ending Usage: The original ending, \\"We were worried about leaving all of our friends and family. When we moved, we found that everyone was very nice. We had no reason to worry, because we made a lot of new friends.\\" concludes the story from the perspective of \\"we\\", which might include the narrator and other family members. Part #4: Understanding the New Ending Usage: The new ending, \\"He was worried about leaving all of our friends and family. When he moved, he found that everyone was very nice. He had no reason to worry, because he made a lot of new friends.\\" is the same as the original but it is from the father's perspective, rather than \\"we\\". Part #5: Creating a Counterfactual Context Usage: The counterfactual context might be \\"My dad lived in Dallas at the time and had to move far away, leaving us behind.\\" Here, I subtly reworded the initial context to fit the new ending, implying that only the dad moved while the narrator and the rest of the family might have stayed in Dallas.

Q:Information: - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ; in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos. - An academy (Attic Greek: ; Koine Greek ) is an institution of secondary education, higher learning, research, or honorary membership. - Attic Greek is the main Greek dialect that was spoken in ancient Attica, which includes Athens. Of the ancient dialects, it is the most similar to later Greek and is the standard form of the language that is studied in ancient-Greek language courses. Attic Greek is sometimes included in the Ionic dialect. Together, Attic and Ionic are the primary influences on Modern Greek. - The Western world or the West is a term usually referring to different nations, depending on the context, most often including at least part of Europe. There are many accepted definitions about what they all have in common. The Western world is also known as the Occident (from Latin: \\"occidens\\" \\"sunset, West\\", as contrasted with Orient). - Alexandria (or ; Arabic: '; '; \\"\\") is the second largest city and a major economic centre in Egypt, extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in the north central part of the country. Its low elevation on the Nile delta makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Byzantium (\\"Byzántion\\") was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople, and later still Istanbul. Byzantium was colonised by the Greeks from Megara in . - Classical Greece was a period of around 200 years (5th and 4th centuries BC) in Greek culture. This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period. - Not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Elder Olympiodorus the Younger ( Greek : ; c. 495 -- 570 ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher , astrologer and teacher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire , after Justinian 's Decree of 529 AD which closed Plato 's Academy in Athens and other pagan schools . Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria ( see Alexandrian School ) ; after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians , and was eventually moved to Constantinople . - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Constantinople was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\", \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\". - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire. - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? What object entity has the relation of 'languages spoken or written' with the subject 'olympiodorus the younger'?

Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit and Swagger assesses a site in Philadelphia as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the Ethiopian archbishop is instead shot while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot twice by a city police officer, but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter and stage a manhunt for the injured sniper. However, he meets a rookie FBI special agent, Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car. After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late spotter and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review, but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer who shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a \\"mugging\\". When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors.

Title: Dissapointed Review: I brought this book based on several recommendations. I admit that I didn't read much of it before I gave up - only the first 30 pages - so perhaps I am not the most reliable of reviewers, but this book was so much of a letdown for me that I could not stomach another word (or mention of the dreaded \\"cinammon rolls\\").My issue with it was that the narrative felt rambling and disorganized. In a scene where the main character has her first meeting with the vampires, the narrative gets so wrapped up in her talking about the past that I could barely follow what was going on. At a pivotal scene such as this, I expected much better writing. Since the author failed to deliver, I felt it not worth my time or effort to keep on reading. Getting even this far in the book was a struggle and a chore for me. I was bored and did not feel any interest for the main character and her obsession with baking.

The college presents a symmetrical front to New Road and the castle mound, with four small gables between a larger gable at either end. There are two quadrangles, with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle (to the east) to the lower quadrangle (to the west). Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle, whilst the hall, library, and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle. The buildings are two storeys high, with dormers above. There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two); the writer Simon Jenkins said that these are \\"almost puddles\\", and saw them as relics of Harrison's Mediterranean plan. The writer Peter Sager, however, thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site. The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the hall on its east side. The square-mullioned windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close-set groups of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the common room has a larger bay window. An abstract sculpture by Hubert Dalwood, from 1962, has been positioned on the lawn inside the college. Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle, although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented, \\"leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose\\". The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels. The furniture in the hall was designed by, and the chairs were built by, Edward Barnsley.

Summarize this article: Oscar-winning filmmaker talks “Capitalism,” politics and Oscars with Raw Story Just over a year ago, Michael Moore vigorously campaigned for President Obama and the Democratic Party. But watching them jettison the public option from health care legislation appears to have been the final straw. “These Democrats are a bunch of wusses,” Moore told Raw Story in a hard-edged interview Wednesday. “They don’t have the courage of their convictions. They won’t stand and fight.” Health care is a uniquely important issue for the liberal filmmaker, whose 2007 documentary “Sicko” explored the heartbreaks and inequities in the US health care industry. He says he’s fed up with the Democrats’ reticence to take on insurance companies. “It’s embarrassing, it’s disgusting and I won’t have it anymore,” he told Raw Story, mocking them in a baby’s voice. “I’m sick of them.” His views on the Republicans? Well, at least they have cojones, Moore said. “You really have to admire the Republicans on some level, because they stand up for what they believe in,” he said. “They come into town, and when they win, oh they win. They come in with guns blazing.” Watch video of the interview at the bottom of the story. A social critic who believes his government regularly fails to stand up for working people, Moore also took aim at Sen. Jim Bunning’s (R-KY) single-handed five-day-long hold on an unemployment benefits extension. “I remember him as a kid,” said the Michigan-born-and-raised filmmaker. “He was a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers. He held the record for hitting the most number of batters with a baseball, beaning them… He was an angry pitcher. He was crazy then, and he’s crazy now.” Moore said Bunning is doing to America’s workforce what he did to America’s batters many decades ago. “He’s beaning the workers,” he said. The Senate finally passed the unemployment benefits package late Tuesday after accepting a symbolic Bunning amendment. “Capitalism: A Love Story” Moore’s newest documentary, “Capitalism: A Love Story,” assails the rampant inequality of wealth in the United States, and is currently the eighth highest grossing documentary of all time. Its controversial thesis is that capitalism and democracy are fundamentally incompatible because such a system will inevitably lead to a plutocracy where the wealthy control the means of power and take advantage of working people. His problem isn’t the excesses of capitalism, he says, but rather in the concept itself. “Capitalism is in and of itself the problem,” he told Raw Story. “Anytime the profit motive is the foundation for what you’re doing, I think you’re doomed.” In the film, Moore mentions Western Europe and Japan as examples from which the United States can learn, but he said even they have their limitations. “I hail them only in the sense that they’ve at least found a way to put a friendly face on capitalism, so it’s a little less harsh than it is on their people here,” he said. “But ultimately, they’ll succumb to the same things, as we’ve seen with Toyota,” he averred. “Once they became the General Motors, the number one, they got more greedy. They decided, ‘why should we spend 7 cents on this little wire, when we can spend 4?'” Fahrenheit Obama? Moore shot to the national spotlight by forcefully criticizing the war and national security policies of President George W. Bush in the 2004 “Fahrenheit 9/11,” the highest grossing documentary of all time. Would he consider making a follow-up film with a similarly critical look at President Obama? “Yes, I would consider that, absolutely,” he said. “Unless we stop this escalation of the Afghanistan war, we are going to have to quit calling it Bush’s war and call it Obama’s war.” Though he’s a frequent recipient of conservatives’ ire, Moore rejected allegations that he’s a partisan, noting that he regularly assailed President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, as he chastises Obama now. “I’ve always made movies and television shows and written books where I’ve tried to do my best to keep an eye on those in power,” he said. Four of Moore’s flicks last decade cracked the box office’s top 10. Two of those came after Fahrenheit 9/11. Yet some of his critics have labeled all his releases since the 2004 record-breaker a flop. Is he cursed? “Oh man,” Moore said with an exuberant laugh. “When I read something like that, it’s so Orwellian. It’s like it’s 1984. My movie becomes, like you said, the eighth largest grossing documentary of all time and — ‘ah that’s a flop, he’s all over.’ I don’t know what to do!” Oscars In the interview, Moore offered his takes on several of the top-rated movies of 2009, and offered a glimpse into his thoughts as he prepared to vote for his favorite flicks in the year’s fast-approaching annual Academy Awards. “The Hurt Locker”: I have mixed feelings about The Hurt Locker. I think Kathryn Bigelow is an excellent filmmaker. I really appreciate some of the things she said about the war… But as a film, I think it’s… I mean you’re on the edge of the seat during the whole film. But if the bulk of the film is about, should you snip the red wire or the green wire, that would put anybody on the edge of their seats. It’s kind of an easy way…to tell a story and get you sort of on that emotional jag. “Avatar”: Avatar is a very brave and bold vision and statement about the times in which we live, but done as allegory, and set 200 years into the future. “Troubled Water” (Norwegian film): My favorite film of the year came from Norway, and it really didn’t get distributed in this country. It’s called Troubled Water. I think it’s out on DVD now. I would do a Masters class in how this film was put together, so brilliant. Others: There were a number of good films this year and a number of them weren’t in the Oscar battle. One was District 9, [which] I really loved. I loved Inglorious Basterds. I loved the animated film Up. Up in the Air I think said some really important things. I think Jason Reitman’s a great filmmaker. This video is from Raw Story, uploaded March 4, 2010.

Anyone surprised? He had very strong words for the Democratic Party, the state of our political system and Glenn Beck. What he thinks of Democrats and Republicans: You know, I tell you, these Democrats are disgusting. Wimps and wusses and weasels. You know, get some spine. This is why I have to admire the Republicans. They at least stand for something. They at least have the courage of their convictions. They get elected to office, they come into town, and they go \\"Get outta my way, there's a new sheriff in town. This is the way we're doing things. Get outta here.\\" And then they do it. You know.

Watch More Young Turks Interviews Here ||||| Summary:","completion":"This is a story about a man named Michael Moore. He makes movies about things that are important to him. One thing that is really important to him is health care, which means making sure everyone can see a doctor when they are sick. He was really upset because he didn't think the Democratic Party, one group of people who make rules for the country, was fighting hard enough for health care. He thought they were scared to fight and that made him very frustrated. He also talked about Republicans, another group of people who make rules for the country. He thinks they are very brave because they fight for what they believe in. One of those Republicans, a man named Jim Bunning, did something that Michael didn't like. He stopped people who didn't have jobs from getting money to help them. Michael also made a movie called \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\". He thinks that capitalism, a way for people to make and sell things, isn't very fair. He said it's bad when people only make and sell things to get a lot of money, because then they don't care about the people who work for them. Lastly, Michael said he might make another movie about a man named President Obama because he is upset about a war in a place called Afghanistan. Michael thinks if this war doesn't stop, we'll have to call it Obama's war, not Bush's war. Bush was another president before Obama. Michael criticizes or tells off people in power no matter which party they belong to, not only Republicans but also Democrats."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most, seldomly seen anything so constructed! What is the sentiment of this review? Options: * negative; * positive;","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer uses strong negative language throughout their analysis of the film, indicating clearly that they did not enjoy it. They describe the film as 'horrible', expressing extreme dissatisfaction with it. Words such as 'suck' further build on this negative feedback and the reviewer clearly states that they took issue with the narrative, specifically its predictability and lack of originality. They only gave the film two points, one for Angelina Jolie, and the other for the appearance of a Porsche. It's clear that these two elements are the only aspects they enjoyed or appreciated - and even then, their appreciation seems to be more related to personal taste than the film's actual storytelling or technical qualities. The statement about the 'Happyend' and how they haven't 'seldomly seen anything so constructed' also reveals their dissatisfaction. Assuming they mean 'contrived' or 'forced' by 'constructed', this complaint shows that they found the ending of the film to be inauthentic or unconvincing, which is another sign of negative sentiment. Finally, it's worth highlighting that there are no positive words in this review to balance out or neutralize the negative ones. The review lacks any kind of praise for the film's plot, acting, direction, script, cinematography, etc. This absence of positive commentary further underscores the fact that this is, indeed, a negative review. Therefore, scrutinizing the language used, tone, and feedback, it's evident that the sentiment of this review is negative and the viewer was not pleased with the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Tour de France is a prestigious, annual men's multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France. The race, which typically consists of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period, covers around 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) throughout France and occasionally in nearby countries. The Tour de France, which began in 1903, is one of the three major European professional cycling races comprising the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) World Tour and is considered as the most famous and influential race in the world of professional cycling. The Col de Manse, situated at an altitude of 1,268 meters (4,160 feet) in the Massif des Écrins, is a popular inclusion in the race due to its challenging nature, scenic beauty, and pronounced elevation gain. The pass connects the city of Gap with the high Champsaur valley, which is known for its picturesque villages and stunning views, making it an attractive destination for both cyclists and tourists alike. The ski resort of Orcières-Merlette, located nearby, is an additional draw. Given that the Tour de France crossed the Col de Manse twice in 2013, it would be accurate to say that there was a bike race held on the pass six years ago, assuming the current year is 2019.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"global warming most threatens the Earth's ability to do what?\\" is \\"reproduce\\", given that if global warming continues, Earth may no longer be able to sustain life? Options: a). Yes; b). No; Answer:","completion":"Answer: b). No; While it is true that global warming poses a significant threat to the Earth's ability to sustain life, the answer \\"reproduce\\" is not the most appropriate in this context. Global warming affects many aspects of the Earth's functions, impacting both the environment and the organisms that inhabit it. It is important to look at the effects of global warming on a broader scale to understand the various ways it threatens the Earth. Global warming, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, has resulted in an increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, in the Earth's atmosphere. This has led to a rise in average temperatures worldwide, known as the greenhouse effect. The consequences of these changes can be seen in a variety of ways, which include: 1. Melting of polar ice caps and glaciers: The rising temperatures have caused the melting of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, as well as glaciers worldwide. This has led to a rise in sea levels, threatening coastal communities and resulting in the loss of habitat for many species. 2. Changes in weather patterns and extreme weather events: Global warming has been linked to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts. These events have a negative impact on agriculture, infrastructure, and the availability of resources. 3. Loss of biodiversity: Rising temperatures and disrupted weather patterns have led to shifts in ecosystems, causing stress on various plant and animal species. Some species have become extinct, while others have been forced to adapt or migrate. 4. Ocean acidification: As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise, the oceans absorb much of this gas, leading to a decrease in pH levels. This acidification can harm marine life, such as coral reefs and shellfish, and disrupt the food chain. 5. Human health and well-being: Global warming can worsen air quality, increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, and contribute to the spread of diseases transmitted by insects, such as malaria and dengue fever. While it is clear that global warming can have a severe impact on the Earth's ability to sustain life, it is essential to recognize that the consequences are multifaceted and interconnected. The changes caused by global warming affect ecosystems, food and water resources, human health and well-being, and ultimately, the survival of many species, including humans. Hence, a more accurate answer to the question \\"global warming most threatens the Earth's ability to do what?\\" would be \\"maintain a stable and habitable environment.\\" This answer encompasses the diverse range of impacts that global warming has on the Earth and its inhabitants, rather than focusing solely on reproduction. Nevertheless, safeguarding the Earth's ability to sustain life remains a crucial priority as we address the complex and interconnected challenges posed by global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The historic waterfront City Point, also known as Oyster Point, lies in the southern part of the city. It is one of the distinct neighborhoods of the city, which is situated near the harbor and water-front. This area has a rich history and has played a significant role in the development of the city over time. City Point is bordered by water on three sides, with the harbor to the south and west, and the Long Wharf district located to the southeast. With its advantageous location near the water, City Point has long been a hub for maritime activities, including shipbuilding, oyster harvesting, and fishing. Historically, City Point has been a focal point for maritime trade and industry. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the neighborhood thrived, with numerous shipyards building both merchant and naval vessels. The area's fertile waters made it an ideal location for oyster farming, which fueled the local economy and led to the nickname \\"Oyster Point.\\" As the city grew and developed, City Point's prominence began to decline with the advent of rail and motor transportation, which diminished the importance of water-based trade. However, its historical significance and charm remain an integral part of the city's cultural fabric. Today, the City Point neighborhood is characterized by its historic architecture and waterfront homes, some of which date back to the 18th century. The community is knit together by a strong sense of history, with many locals expressing great pride in their neighborhood and its maritime traditions. Public parks, such as the nearby Long Wharf Nature Preserve, provide beautiful views of the harbor and serve as a reminder of the area's connection to the water. In conclusion, the historic waterfront City Point lies in the southern part of the city, bordered by the harbor and water-front. Its rich history as a hub for maritime trade and industry has played a significant role in shaping the city's development, and its wealth of historic architecture and waterfront homes serve as a testament to its storied past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We may think of vanity as a quintessentially human trait - but these photographs show that the animal world can be just as self-obsessed. When this penguin in the Antarctic caught sight of its reflection in a pool of water, it stood staring at itself for a whole 10 minutes. It paraded up and down the edge of the pool in the inlet of Neko Harbour - and although it repeatedly turned to leave, it kept rushing back to admire itself again. Vain: This penguin spent 10 minutes admiring its reflection in a pool of water in Neko Harbour, Antarctica. Intrigued: The bird appeared to be absolutely fascinated with the sight of itself in the water. Rare: It is unusual to get 'mirror calm' conditions because of the Antarctic's stormy weather. Anthony Pierce, the photographer who captured the remarkable snaps, said: 'The penguin was standing there for at least 10 minutes in total. 'It was turning its head from side to side and looking itself up and down repeatedly. It was actually looking itself in the eye sometimes. 'Some of the other penguins came to the water's edge, but they just drank some water from the pool and moved on. None of them looked at their reflection. 'Then the vain penguin came along. I was quite surprised by its behaviour.' Obsessive: The penguin kept walking away and then returning to look at itself once more. Fascinated: Other penguins went to the pool to drink, but did not stop to stare at themselves. He added: 'It almost seemed to have a bit of a strut as it left. 'Penguins are amazing animals. They have enormous character and personality on camera, which always makes for interesting photographs. 'They are also incredibly tough and resilient creatures; surviving in one of the harshest environments on earth.' Mr Pierce said that it was rare to see such a sight, because the conditions in the Antarctic are usually so windy that pools are almost never 'mirror calm'. Handsome? The penguin derived endless entertainment from the sight of itself. Strut: The penguin appeared pleased when it finally walked away, according to photographer Anthony Pierce. He said: 'It's really unusual to have perfect conditions like this. There has to be no breeze at all for a reflection shot like this to work. 'I can't ever remember seeing an animal take such an interest in its reflection before. 'It was a fantastic experience to witness this behaviour.'

Please answer the following question: The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, “While agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy...

Question: \\"What religious group increase political influence in the text\\" Context: \\"Augustus' religious reformations raised the funding and public profile of the Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia, wife of Augustus. They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus, he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the given text, the religious group that increased their political influence is the Vestals, also known as the Vestal Virgins. The Vestals were priestesses dedicated to Vesta, the goddess of the hearth, in ancient Rome. They played an essential role in maintaining the sacred fire of Vesta and performing rituals for the welfare of the Roman state. Augustus' religious reformations played a significant role in raising the profile and political influence of the Vestals. By increasing their funding and public visibility, they gained more prominence in society. They were allocated high-status seating at games and theatres, which showcased their importance and influence. Furthermore, the emperor Claudius appointed the Vestals as priestesses to the cult of the deified Livia, the wife of Augustus. This appointment not only cemented their position as influential religious figures but also brought them closer to the ruling class, enhancing their political influence within the Empire. The Vestal Virgins retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, even as political power shifted to the Christians within the Roman Empire. The Christian emperor Gratian's refusal of the office of pontifex maximus signaled a decline in the Vestals' influence, but their prominence persisted for some time. However, their political influence eventually diminished when Theodosius I, another Christian emperor, took further steps to dissolve the order. He extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated her temple, thus bringing an end to one of the most prominent religious orders in ancient Rome. In conclusion, the text describes how the Vestals gained political influence due to Augustus' religious reformations and other imperial actions, but ultimately lost this influence as the Empire embraced Christianity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based. - Carlo Tamberlani (11 March 1899 5 August 1980) was an Italian film actor. He appeared in 127 films between 1931 and 1976. He was born in Salice Salentino, Italy and died in Subiaco, Italy. - Giallo (plural \\"gialli\\") is a 20th-century Italian thriller or horror genre of literature and film, usually with mystery elements and often with slasher, crime fiction or, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. In Italy, the term simply denotes thrillers, typically of the crime fiction, mystery, and horror subgenres, regardless of the country of origin. In English-speaking countries, however, the term \\"giallo\\" is used to refer to a particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery film which often includes elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre). The genre began in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined over the next few decades (although some examples continue to be produced). It has been considered to be a predecessor to, and significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre. - Arturo Dominici (2 January 1918 - 7 September 1992) was an Italian actor and dubbing artist. - Mario Bava (31 July 1914 27 April 1980) was an Italian director, screenwriter, special effects artist and cinematographer from the \\"golden age\\" of Italian horror films. His work kick-started the giallo film genre and the modern \\"slasher film\\". His son Lamberto Bava later went on to become a noted horror film director in his own right. - Lamberto Bava (born 3 April 1944) is an Italian film director. Born in Rome, Bava began worked as an assistant director on the film's of his father Mario Bava. Bava co-directed the television film \\"La Venere d'Ille\\" with his father and in 1980 directed his first solo feature film \\"Macabre\\". - Ukrainian culture and customs of Ukraine and ethnic Ukrainians. Ukraine has a shared culture and history with neighboring nations, dating back to the 9th century and the Land of Rus. Mutual customs are shared among the cultures of Ukraine, Belarus, Ukrainian Cossacks and Turkic peoples of Central Asia. Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by the Eastern Orthodox Church and traditions from Slavic mythology. The Soviet era unified the cultures of many unrelated nations with a common language. - Barbara Steele (born 29 December 1937) is an English film actress and producer. She is best known for starring in Italian gothic horror films of the 1960s. Her breakthrough role came in Italian director Mario Bava's \\"Black Sunday\\" (1960). - Ivo Garrani (6 February 1924 25 March 2015) was an Italian actor. In films since 1952, Garrani is possibly best known for his role as Prince Vajda in Mario Bava's \\"Black Sunday\\" (1960). Background. Born in Introdacqua, Garrani was a student at the Faculty of Engineering in Rome when started his theatrical career, at first as amateur, then entering the stage company of Carlo Tamberlani in 1943.

Stainless steel is a versatile and widely used material known for its corrosion resistance, durability, and ease of maintenance. The development of stainless steel is primarily attributed to the addition of a minimum of 10.5% chromium to the iron and carbon combination found in ordinary steel. Chromium's function in stainless steel is multifaceted. Firstly, it helps form a thin, stable, and continuous surface layer of chromium oxide (Cr2O3). This layer develops spontaneously when stainless steel comes into contact with oxygen, either from the air or via water. The chromium oxide layer is capable of self-repair, meaning that if it is damaged, a new layer will form quickly to restore its protective capacity. This passive layer prevents further corrosion and protects the base metal from deteriorating due to chemical reactions with the environment. The effectiveness of chromium in creating the protective oxide layer is directly related to the concentration of chromium in the steel. Higher chromium content results in better corrosion resistance. For example, while a minimum of 10.5% chromium is necessary for stainless steel, many grades contain much higher chromium levels (up to around 26% in some cases) to provide increased corrosion resistance for more demanding applications. Aside from chromium, other elements are often added to stainless steel to enhance its performance and tailor its properties for specific applications. Some of these important alloying elements include: 1. Nickel (Ni): Added to improve overall corrosion resistance, mechanical properties, and formability. Nickel also stabilizes the austenitic crystal structure, one of the primary microstructures found in stainless steel. 2. Molybdenum (Mo): Increases pitting and crevice corrosion resistance, particularly in chlorides, making the steel suitable for marine and chemical processing applications. 3. Titanium (Ti) and Niobium (Nb): Added to stabilize the steel when carbon content is higher to prevent intergranular corrosion, which can occur when the material is heated or cooled. 4. Manganese (Mn) and Nitrogen (N): Used to replace some nickel content in certain stainless steel grades, helping to reduce cost while maintaining desirable properties. 5. Carbon (C): Present in most stainless steels in small amounts, but excessive carbon can contribute to the formation of chromium carbide and intergranular corrosion. Hence, low-carbon stainless steel options, known as L-grades like 304L and 316L, are available for corrosive environments. These various alloying elements enable the creation of a vast array of stainless steel grades with characteristics suited for different applications, spanning from everyday items like cutlery and kitchen appliances to more demanding uses in chemical processing, aerospace, and construction industries. In summary, chromium is the key element added to steel to make it stainless. This element creates an oxide layer that prevents corrosion and provides characteristic properties such as durability and resistance to the stainless steel. Various other alloying elements can also be added to further optimize the material for specific applications."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence and a verb from the sentence.

Question: \\"What era was where the Buddhism flourished?\\" Context: \\"Mahayana Buddhism flourished in India from the 5th century CE onwards, during the dynasty of the Guptas. Mahāyāna centres of learning were established, the most important one being the Nālandā University in north-eastern India.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"The era during which Buddhism, particularly Mahayana Buddhism, flourished was the era of the Gupta dynasty, which lasted from the 4th to 6th centuries CE in India. The Gupta Empire is considered to be the Golden Age of India, a time of great cultural, artistic, and intellectual achievements, as well as the expansion and consolidation of political power. Under the Gupta rulers, numerous religious traditions coexisted and prospered, including Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. However, it was during this time that Mahayana Buddhism experienced significant growth, development, and dissemination. The Gupta era was an ideal time for the expansion of Mahayana Buddhism for several reasons. First, the Gupta rulers were known for their patronage of various religious traditions, allowing for the free practice and exchange of ideas. Although the rulers themselves often followed the Hindu faith, they showed tolerance and support towards Buddhism as well. This religious tolerance provided a favorable environment for the Mahayana Buddhist tradition to evolve, adapt, and gain followers. Second, the Gupta Empire had strong trade connections, particularly with Central Asia, China, and Sri Lanka. These connections facilitated the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to countries beyond India. The art, literature, and architecture associated with Mahayana Buddhism received significant influence from the Greco-Buddhist art, which resulted from the interactions between the Indian and Hellenistic civilizations. The fusion of Indian and Hellenistic styles played a crucial role in the development of Buddhist art, contributing to the spread of Mahayana Buddhism in the region. One of the most important developments for Mahayana Buddhism during the Gupta era was the establishment of great centers of learning, such as the Nalanda University in north-eastern India (in present-day Bihar). Nalanda University was one of the first great universities in recorded history and served as a primary center for the study and practice of Mahayana Buddhism. It attracted scholars, monks, and students from India and abroad, including countries like China, Tibet, and Southeast Asia. The presence of scholars from different countries allowed for the exchange of ideas, leading to the further development of Mahayana Buddhism. Nalanda's curriculum was comprehensive, covering subjects such as logic, philosophy, medicine, and science, alongside religious studies. This multidisciplinary approach showcased the openness of the Buddhist learning tradition and attracted international attention. The flourishing of Mahayana Buddhism in the Gupta era was evident in the advancements of literature and philosophy during this time. Numerous Mahayana sutras, the sacred texts of the tradition, were written or translated into various languages, enabling their dissemination among a broader audience. Philosophers and scholars refined Mahayana Buddhist teachings and developed various schools of thought. Some of the famous Buddhist scholars and philosophers during this era include Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, Asanga, and Dignaga, who made significant contributions to the development of Buddhist philosophy. In conclusion, the era during which Buddhism, particularly Mahayana Buddhism, flourished was the era of the Gupta dynasty, which lasted from the 4th to 6th centuries CE in India. This period is known as the Golden Age of India, which provided a favorable environment for the growth, development, and dissemination of Mahayana Buddhism. The establishment of major centers of learning like Nalanda University, the patronage of the Gupta rulers, and the expansion of trade routes allowed for the spread of Mahayana Buddhism both within India and beyond its borders, contributing to the rich and diverse tradition that we have today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence (Jesse James).

I had never heard of Leos Carax until his Merde segment in last years Tokyo, and his was easily the stand-out the film's three stories. It wasn't my favorite of the shorts, but it was the most unique, and the most iconic. \\"The Lovers on the Bridge\\" was the first of his full length features I've seen, a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic. Though he's classified as a neo-nouvelle vogue, his films owe as much to silent cinema as the 60's experimental narratives. His movies are closer to Jean Vigo in \\"L'atlante\\", Jean Cocteau, and Guy Maddin, than Godard and Truffaut. In Boy Meets Girl Carax's 1984 debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states. He combines the exaggerated worlds of Maddin, but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like Cocteau, but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible, emotional, and engaging like Vigo's movies. The story of Boy Meets Girl is simple, and similar to Carax's two following films which comprise this \\"Young lovers\\" trilogy. A boy named Alex played by Denis Lavant (who plays a character named Alex in Carax's next two movies), has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend. In the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder. He walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex, and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate. He steals records for her and leaves them at his friend's apartment, but avoids contacting either of them directly. He wanders around and finds his way to a party, where he meets a suicidal young woman, and the film becomes part \\"Breathless\\" and part \\"Limelight\\". Later he is advised by an old man with sign language to \\"speak up for yourself...young people today It's like they forgot how to talk.\\" The old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film, and how an actor timid off stage became a confident \\"lion\\" when in front of the camera. Heres where the movie tips its hand, but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene, since it overlaps the style of the film (silent and expressionist), with the content (a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to). Though Alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end, he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren't easy to nail down from moment to moment, aside from a desire to fall in love. There is a scene in the film where Alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies, all crying in a chorus that fills that room, until he turns on a tape of a children's show making them fall silent. Unexpectedly due a glitch the TV ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses. Even as Carax is self-reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell (the room full of whining infants), he's mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses. Even the rich old, bell of the ball has a brother she misses. In another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence. Though indebted to films before talkies, Carax is a master of music, knowing when to pipe in the Dead Kennedy's \\"Holiday in Cambodia\\", or an early David Bowie song, the sounds of a man playing piano, or of a girl softly humming. In Boy Meets Girl, when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt, when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin 360 degrees as if attached to a carousel, when Alex enters a party an feels out of place, its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance; like the famous author who can't speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain, or the miss universe of 1950 standing just across from the astronaut. This film is the missing link between Jean Piere Jenuet, Michel Gondry, and Wes Anderson, whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy, all have a parallel with different visuals, musical, and emotional cues in these Carax movies. Every line of dialog, every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level, some I lack words to articulate. There are many tales of a boy meeting a girl, but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment. The other movies you want to watch can wait. See this first. If I were to make films, I would want them to be like this, in fact I wish all films were like this, where the ephemeral becomes larger than life, and life itself becomes a dream. Choose your answer.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Distinguished Mr. Speaker, dear listeners, the decisions made at the spring European Council meeting seem to be successful, but we are aware that they are criticized based on the actions that have been carried out. In the spring European Council meeting, representatives from European Union member states came together to discuss various issues relevant to the EU and its citizens. The decisions made at this meeting appear to have been successful in addressing the concerns and objectives of member states. However, we must be mindful of the fact that these decisions are not immune to criticism. It is essential for us to understand that such criticism is not unfounded, as it is based on the actions, policies, and outcomes that have resulted from these decisions. This is an important aspect of democratic accountability, through which the efficacy and appropriateness of these decisions can be evaluated and improved upon if necessary. Several factors can contribute to the evaluation of the spring European Council meeting's decisions. These factors may include: 1. Implementation: The effectiveness of any decision made in a high-level political forum like the European Council depends significantly on its implementation by European Union institutions and national governments. To evaluate the success of these decisions, it is essential to assess whether they have been implemented as planned and if they have led to intended outcomes. 2. Impact: Another critical factor to consider while evaluating these decisions is their impact on European citizens and member states. Successful decisions should result in tangible, positive changes and improvements for those whom the decisions affect. By examining the outcomes and impacts of these decisions, critics can better assess their success and efficacy. 3. Transparency: The European Council's decision-making process must be transparent and participatory to ensure democratic legitimacy. The more transparent the decision-making process is, the more likely the decisions are to be successful in the long run, as they will have the support and trust of the public. 4. Responsiveness: The European Council must be able to adapt and respond to the changing needs and priorities of European citizens and member states. This includes revising or amending decisions when necessary, based on new information or developments. A decision can only be considered genuinely successful if it remains relevant and effective in the face of change. By considering these factors while evaluating the decisions made at the spring European Council meeting, it becomes clear that their success is not solely based on the actions that have been carried out. Rather, success should be measured by examining the entire decision-making process, the implementation, the resulting impact on those affected by the decisions, their ability to remain relevant and responsive to change, and the level of transparency involved. By doing so, we can ensure that the European Council's decisions continue to benefit European citizens and member states, while maintaining the democratic values of accountability and legitimacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer based on context: The East Asia/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by China, the region’s most populous country. China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002. China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence. This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts. However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases. Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs. Singapore has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides Iceland, in the world, at 3%. Cambodia has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume iodized salt.

For the first iteration, the element at index 0 ('h') is collected and added to the result list. Now, result = ['h']. Since i = 1, the next index to collect is 0 + 1 = 1. Step 5: Stop the loop when the next ith element exceeds the length of the list A. For the next iteration, the element at index 1 ('4807') is collected and added to the result list. Now, result = ['h', '4807']. Since i = 1, the next index to collect is 1 + 1 = 2. For the next iteration, the element at index 2 ('7985') is collected and added to the result list. Now, result = ['h', '4807', '7985']. Since i = 1, the next index to collect is 2 + 1 = 3. For the next iteration, the element at index 3 ('C') is collected and added to the result list.

The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

Summarize this article: Earlier this month, Mr Hoare apologised after calling the Isle of Wight a \\"ghetto\\" where there had been \\"inbreeding\\". On Tuesday, Ofsted issued a statement saying he was resigning with immediate effect. Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner said Mr Hoare's comments had been \\"inaccurate, insulting and extremely unhelpful\\". Mr Hoare said in his resignation statement: \\"It has been a great privilege to chair the Ofsted board for the past two years.\\" He had chaired the board of England's education watchdog - setting the strategic direction for the more high-profile role of chief inspector, currently held by Sir Michael Wilshaw. Mr Hoare's comments about the underachievement of poor white pupils on the Isle of Wight, made at a teaching conference, had prompted calls for his resignation. \\"Most people go there for sailing for two weeks a year. There's a sailing club that is one of the best in the world, where there's champagne,\\" he had said. \\"But just within inches, there are people who live in a ghetto ... They think of it as holiday land. But it is shocking. It's a ghetto; there has been inbreeding.\\" Mr Hoare spoke of educational underachievement and social problems. \\"Seven state schools were all less than good. \\"There is a mass of crime, drug problems, huge unemployment.\\" Mr Hoare later said: \\"My intention was to highlight how concerned I am about the unacceptably poor performance of schools on the Isle of Wight over many years and how this is damaging the prospects of young people who live on the island. \\"Those who know me will realise that I am passionate about improving outcomes for children from our most disadvantaged communities and my comments were made in this context.\\" Education Secretary Justine Greening, accepting his resignation, said: \\"I would like to thank David for his hard work in this role over the past two years.\\" Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \\"His position became increasingly untenable after he made those shockingly offensive comments. He demonised the entire population of the Isle of Wight.\\" James Kempton, a member of the Ofsted board, will take over as Ofsted chairman on an interim basis. Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner said: \\"The role of Ofsted is to help improve education, not demoralise teachers, insult parents and pupils and those involved in raising education standards. \\"His resignation, albeit somewhat delayed was probably inevitable and clearly for the best. \\"I said at the time that he would never have dared make such remarks about an area with a high ethnic population, and I stand by that view.\\" Jonathan Bacon, leader of the Isle of Wight Council, said that standards were improving in the island's schools. He invited Mr Hoare's successor to visit the Isle of Wight \\"in order to learn more about the challenges we face and ensure that Ofsted is playing the fullest possible part, working alongside the other agencies, to support the further improvement of educational outcomes\\". Kevin Courtney, leader of the National Union of Teachers, said it was \\"correct\\" that Mr Hoare had resigned, saying that his comments had been \\"insulting and ill-judged\\". \\"Schools and teachers in areas facing challenges need constructive support and fair evaluation not denigration. It's all too easy to throw insults around rather than exploring realistic answers.\\" Summary:","completion":"David Hoare, the Ofsted chairman, has resigned after making controversial comments about the Isle of Wight, which he described as a “ghetto” where there had been “inbreeding”.

Q: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: How important can a fifteen-year-old boy's work be? Well, Louis Braille's work changed the world. Born in a small town near Paris in 1809, shortly after his third birthday Louis blinded himself in one eye while playing with a sharp pointed tool in his father's workshop. He soon lost the sight in his other eye when the infection spread. He wanted to go to school, but in his small town there was no school for him. At that time, blind people did not get any school education. Braille went to Paris to study, but there were few books for the blind. Louis knew that books were the key to learning. He struggled with ideas for three years. Finally, at fifteen, he invented an alphabet made with raised dots . Blind people could \\"read\\" by feeling the patterns of the dots. Being able to read Braille allows blind children to learn together with the sighted at school, and go on to get jobs. It allows people who lose their eyesight to continue to read, learn and get information. Answer:","completion":"Question: What significant contribution did Louis Braille make to the world at the age of fifteen? a) He wrote a book about his experience as a blind person b) He invented an alphabet made of raised dots for blind people to read c) He started a school for blind children d) He authored many books for blind people The question sums up the main point of the article, which is about the invention of Braille by Louis Braille at fifteen. This multiple-choice question gives the reader a few alternative options, but the correct choice will reflect the person's understanding of the article. In this article, the major turning point was when Louis Braille invented an alphabet for the blind, so option b) is the correct answer. All the other options, although plausibly connected to Louis Braille, are not mentioned in this particular article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Questions 1 and 2 are similar in nature but have subtle differences in their interpretation. Question 1: What would we do if we weren't afraid? The first question is geared towards a collective or a group of people, asking what they would do if fear was not a factor. This question highlights the idea that fear often limits our actions or decisions, and in a situation where fear is absent, people may pursue different courses of action. The answer to this question can be explored in a variety of contexts, such as personal growth, social interactions, career choices, and addressing important global issues. By removing fear from the equation, individuals and groups of people would potentially have the freedom to: 1. Pursue their dreams and passions without the fear of failure, judgment, or risk. 2. Engage in conversations and debates addressing sensitive topics like politics, religion, or social justice, leading to more open dialogue and understanding. 3. Take risks and seize opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible due to anxiety, self-doubt, or the fear of change. 4. Embrace vulnerability and express emotions openly, fostering deeper connections with others. 5. Utilize creative and unconventional approaches to problem-solving, ushering in innovative solutions to complex challenges. Question 2: What would you do if you were not afraid of anything? The second question is directed at an individual, asking what actions they would take in their life if they were not hindered by fear. Similar to the first question, it highlights the role of fear in limiting our choices, but the focus is on the individual's personal experiences, goals, and aspirations. The question invites one to reflect on their fears and how these fears may be defining their life's path. If an individual was not afraid of anything, they might choose to: 1. Pursue a career or hobby they are passionate about, without worrying about financial stability or social judgment. 2. Establish and maintain healthier relationships by expressing their feelings openly and honestly. 3. Invest in personal growth and development by embracing new experiences, challenges, and opportunities. 4. Tackle significant personal issues or past traumas with a newfound courage and resilience. 5. Advocate for themselves and their values by standing up against injustice, discrimination, or unfair treatment. In conclusion, while both questions revolve around the theme of fear and its impact on decision-making, the first question looks at the broader collective context of people in general and the second question focuses on individual choices and actions. Regardless of the slight difference in context, the essence of these questions remains the same: understanding how fear influences our lives and exploring the potential outcomes if fear was not a factor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This driver was driving his car on a street and saw two people riding their bicycles. The driver thought that the cyclists were not following the rules of the road, and he got really upset. He wanted everyone on the road to be safe and careful, just like his mommy and daddy taught him. So, the driver decided to talk to the cyclists about their actions. He stopped his car near them, rolled down his window, and started an argument. Oh no! Arguing is not a nice way to talk with others, especially when we're upset. We should always use kind words and try to understand each other's point of view. But guess what? The two cyclists were not just regular people on bikes; they were off-duty police officers! That means they were policemen and women who were taking a break from their jobs, but they still had the same knowledge and authority as when they wear their uniforms. These off-duty police officers listened to what the driver had to say and tried to explain why they were behaving the way they were. But the driver continued to argue with them, not realizing who they were. Oops! That was a big mistake. After realizing that they were speaking with a very stubborn driver, the off-duty police officers kindly explained their identity. The driver was really surprised! He quickly learned that even though they were not wearing their uniforms, the police officers still knew all the rules of the road and how to keep everyone safe while riding their bicycles. Because the driver was not very nice and argued with the off-duty police officers, he was fined £200. A fine is when you have to pay some money because you did something wrong. It helps to teach people a lesson so that they don't make the same mistake again. In the end, the driver learned an important lesson – to always treat other people with respect and not to argue with them. We never know who we might meet and what they can teach us. It's always best to be nice and kind to everyone, even when we're feeling upset. So, boys and girls, remember to be polite and listen to others before jumping to conclusions, just like the wise off-duty police officers in our story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn? from the following article ? Descriptions of Imogen as a small child indicate that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose inherited from her mother. In 1912, at the age of five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Summers were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.In 1917 Imogen began boarding at Eothen, a small, private school for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Gustav's star pupil from SPGS, taught music. A letter home, dated 17 July 1917, tells of \\"compertishions [sic], and ripping prizes, and strawberries and cream for tea\\". At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as \\"topping\\") and theory with Jane Joseph (\\"ripping\\"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—two instrumental pieces and four Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, and 3. In the summer term of 1920, she composed and choreographed a \\"Dance of the Nymphs and Shepherds\\", which was performed at the school under her direction on 9 July.Imogen left Eothen in December 1920 hoping to study under Ruby Ginner at the Ginner-Mawer School of Dance and Drama, but was rejected on health grounds, although there appeared to be no significant medical issue. She then studied at home under a governess, while waiting to start at St Paul's Girls School in the autumn. At Whitsun 1921 she took part as a dancer in her father's production of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Masque of Dioclesian, held in the St Paul's School grounds and repeated a week later in Hyde Park.In September 1921 Imogen began at St Paul's Girls School, and became a boarder from Spring 1922.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A rising population is one of the main reasons that there is global warming. Between 1650 and 1850 the population increased by 0.75 billion people going from 0.25 billion to one billion. From 1930 to the end of the century the population rose from two billion to over six billion. In just a third of the time the population rose by more than five times what it did before. It is expected that this trend in the changing population will continue and could even heighten. The growing population requires increasing amounts of energy. These energy demands and other supplies require production, which almost always involves the emission of greenhouse gases. The more the population increases the more greenhouse gases that are produced and the greater the increase in temperature. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the best-known causes for global warming. The major reason for fossil fuels contributing so much to global warming is the release of carbon that occurs during the burning of fossil fuels. When people burn fossil fuels, they release large amounts of carbon by way of the release of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air then leads to global warming. Another source of carbon dioxide comes from _ . In forests there is a large amount of carbon that is stored in the trees and other plants. This carbon is out of the atmosphere because the trees consume the carbon from carbon dioxide. When people cut down trees, they are frequently burned. This burning releases the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that was stored in organic matter. Even when new trees are planted, it can take up to one hundred years to make up for the carbon that was released. It is commonly thought that because trees absorb more carbon dioxide, the atmosphere experiences positive effects. Sophie Armstrong, the writer of Earth Care put it, \\"There's no doubt that the earth is becoming warmer because of human activity rather than a random but natural phenomenon.

Edith Windsor, the gay-rights activist whose landmark case led the Supreme Court to grant same-sex married couples federal recognition for the first time and rights to a host of federal benefits that until then only married heterosexuals had enjoyed, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 88. Her wife, Judith Kasen-Windsor, confirmed the death, at a hospital, but did not specify a cause. They were married in 2016. Four decades after the Stonewall Inn uprising fueled the fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights in America, Ms. Windsor, the widow of a woman with whom she had lived much of her life, became the lead plaintiff in what is widely regarded as the second most important Supreme Court ruling in the national battle over same-sex marriage rights. The Windsor decision, handed down in 2013, was limited to 13 states and the District of Columbia. But in a more expansive ruling in 2015, in Obergefell v. Hodges and three related cases, the Supreme Court held that same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry anywhere in the nation, with all the protections and privileges of heterosexual couples. Its historic significance was likened to that of Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, which decriminalized gay sex in the United States. ||||| Windsor, known for remaining bubbly and upbeat during her legal battle, contested her estate tax liability after the 2009 death of her longtime wife, Thea Spyer, because the U.S. government did not recognize their Canadian marriage. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Edith Windsor, a prominent gay-rights activist who played a pivotal role in the battle for same-sex marriage rights in the United States, passed away at the age of 88 in Manhattan.

In the October election an editorial asserted: \\"ALL our instincts are left rather than right and we would vote for any able politician who would describe himself as a Social Democrat.\\" What were the Sun's political leanings early on under Murdoch?","completion":"In the early years of Rupert Murdoch's ownership, The Sun's political leanings were initially in favor of the Labour Party, as evidenced by their support for the party led by Harold Wilson during the 1970 General Election. The newspaper prominently displayed a headline stating, \\"Why It Must Be Labour,\\" which clearly indicated their endorsement of the party and its values at that time. However, The Sun's political alignment began to shift as early as February 1974 when they called for a vote for the Conservative Party led by Edward Heath. At the same time, the newspaper suggested that it might still support a Labour Party if it were led by either James Callaghan or Roy Jenkins, both of whom were viewed as more moderate figures within the party. This evolving stance demonstrated that The Sun was not strictly bound to any specific party and was willing to change its endorsements based on the political climate and its assessment of individual politicians and their agendas. By the October election of that year, The Sun's editorial position became more explicitly leaning towards the left, as they claimed: \\"ALL our instincts are left rather than right and we would vote for any able politician who would describe himself as a Social Democrat.\\" This statement illustrated the newspaper's support for social democracy, which is a political ideology that combines elements of socialism and capitalism, seeking to achieve a balance between individual liberties, social justice, and economic efficiency. In summary, under Murdoch's early ownership, The Sun initially supported the Labour Party but gradually shifted its political leanings to endorse the Conservative Party and then later, individuals who identified as Social Democrats. This evolution of The Sun's political stance reflects the dynamic nature of the British political landscape and Murdoch's willingness to pivot the newspaper's alignment based on the perceived needs of the country and the qualities of its political leaders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's time you started eating sensibly. Experts at the first Chinese Students Nutrition and Health Festival in Kunming last week listed eight bad eating habits. *Watching television while having meals or snacks. Doing this means you don't pay attention to your food, forget how full you are, and so overeat. It can also cause digestion diseases. One way to avoid this is only to eat in certain areas of your home. * Replacing meals with snacks. Many students think that eating small snacks can help them diet. But it often results in overeating and health problems related to a lack of vegetables, carbohydrates ,proteins and vitamins. Snacking only works if it is well planned and includes healthy foods such as nuts, vegetables, fruit and yogurt. *Having drinks rather than water. Fizzy drinks and fruit juice are usually high in calories and sugar, which can cause weight problems. Water is important in making your brain cells and every organ in your body work properly. For your body to burn fat, it needs at least eight glasses of pure water a day. Liquids like soda and coffee actually take water away from your body. *Refusing to drink milk. Milk is the best natural food--it provides you with protein, which makes your bones strong and teeth healthy. * Choosing meat and certain vegetables over others. Different foods provide different kinds of nutrition. If you don't have a balanced diet, this can result in malnutrition and a weaker body. *Eating in front of the computer and staying there after meals. Take a walk after eating and it helps your stomach digest the meal. *Buying from roadside snack bars. If you shop at these places, be careful--many are not clean enough. * Eating throat tablets as if they were sweets. If you eat throat tablets when you have no throat disease, they may affect the bacteria in your mouth and cause real throat problems. Question: _ can possibly cause digestion problem. Answer: A:","completion":"Watching television while having meals or snacks can possibly cause digestion problems. This is because doing so distracts you from paying attention to your food and recognizing how full you are, which can lead to overeating and digestion issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 17*h + 13*h + 74 = -16 for h.","completion":"Alright, little buddy! Let's solve this together step by step. We have this math problem: 17 * h + 13 * h + 74 = -16. Our job is to find out what 'h' should be. First, let's add the two parts with 'h' in them. 17 * h and 13 * h can be added because they both have 'h'. When we do this, it looks like this: (17 + 13) * h. So, 17 + 13 is 30. Now we have 30 * h + 74 = -16. Now, we have to get rid of the 74 on the left side to make it easier to find 'h'. We do this by subtracting 74 from both sides of the equation. It looks like this: 30 * h + 74 - 74 = -16 - 74 Since 74 - 74 is 0, we have: 30 * h = -90 (because -16 - 74 is -90) Now, we need to find out what 'h' is! We will do this by dividing both sides by 30: (30 * h) / 30 = -90 / 30 Since 30 / 30 is 1, we get: h = -3 (because -90 / 30 is -3) So, the answer is h = -3.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here is the step-by-step justification: 1. When the climate is dry, it means there is less moisture available in the environment. 2. Since water seeps into rocks as part of the process, a drier climate will result in less water seeping into the rocks. 3. With less water seeping into the rocks, the freezing and thawing process that causes cracks to form in the rocks will be less frequent or less severe. 4. As a result, it will take longer for cracks to form, and the rocks will break down more slowly. As we can see, the dry climate doesn't directly change a step in the process, but rather it affects the amount of water available which in turn influences how quickly the steps of the process unfold.

Terry Eugene Bollea was born in Augusta, Georgia on August 11, 1953, the son of construction foreman Pietro \\"Peter\\" Bollea (December 6, 1913 - December 18, 2001) and homemaker and dance teacher Ruth V. (nee Moody; 1922 - January 1, 2011). He is of French, Italian, Panamanian, and Scottish descent. When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the title to Andre on the February 5 episode of The Main Event after a convoluted scam involving \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After Andre delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, Andre handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and Andre were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop Andre interfering which helped \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title. Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (Andre the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man. In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his \\"War Bonnet\\", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series Are You Serious? in 2012. The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3 episode of The Main Event, when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself. After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a feud between the two. Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V. On April 2, 2005, Hogan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2005 by actor and friend Sylvester Stallone. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Hogan came out to rescue Eugene, who was being attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Khosrow Daivari. The build-up to Hogan's Hall of Fame induction and preparation for his WrestleMania angle was shown on the first season of Hogan Knows Best. The next night on Raw, Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week on Raw, Michaels approached Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but told Michaels if he found a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hogan to team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, saving Michaels and accepting his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels. Hogan then appeared on July 4 episode of Raw, as the special guest of Carlito on his talk-show segment Carlito's Cabana. After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke, Hogan attacked Carlito. Kurt Angle then also appeared, making comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan, who was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle, but was saved by Shawn Michaels. Later that night, Michaels and Hogan defeated Carlito and Angle in a tag team match; during the post-match celebration, Michaels performed the Sweet Chin Music on Hogan and walked off. The following week on Raw, Michaels appeared on Piper's Pit and challenged Hogan to face him one-on-one for the first time. Hogan appeared on Raw one week later and accepted the challenge. The match took place at SummerSlam, which Hogan won. After the match, Michaels extended his hand to him, telling him that he \\"had to find out for himself\\", and Hogan and Michaels shook hands as Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd. Prior to WrestleMania 22 in April 2006, Hogan inducted friend and former announcer \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006. Hogan returned on the July 15 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event with his daughter Brooke. During the show, Randy Orton kayfabe flirted with Brooke and later attacked Hogan in the parking lot. He later challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan won. On October 27, 2009, it was announced that Hogan had signed a contract to join TNA on a full-time basis. The footage of his signing and the press conference at Madison Square Garden following it were featured on the October 29 episode of Impact!. On December 5, 2009, Hogan announced on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)'s The Ultimate Fighter that he would be making his official TNA debut on January 4, 2010, in a special live three-hour Monday night episode of Impact! to compete with WWE's Raw (which featured the return of Bret Hart). Dixie Carter revealed Hogan's role in the company in an interview with The UK Sun stating when his job came to question, \\"He is involved with everything from looking at the talent to how we shoot the show\\". On the January 4 episode of Impact!, Hogan debuted, reuniting briefly with former nWo partners Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman, the latter two of whom made their returns to the company. He, however, refused to join them for a full-fledged reunion of their group claiming, \\"it's a different time\\", and stuck to his business relations with Bischoff, who made his appearance to declare that, the two of them would \\"flip the company upside down\\" and everyone would have to earn their spot. Hogan also encountered TNA founder Jeff Jarrett on the broadcast, appearing via video wall and interrupting Jarrett's company success speech, stating that Carter was instrumental to the company's survival, and that just like the rest, Jarrett would have to (kayfabe) earn his spot in TNA. On the February 18 episode of Impact!, Hogan took Abyss under his wing, and during this sequence, gave him his Hall of Fame ring and claimed it would make him a \\"god of wrestling\\". Hogan made his in-ring return on March 8, teaming with Abyss to defeat A.J. Styles and Ric Flair when Abyss scored a pinfall over Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Hogan and Abyss from a beat down at the hands of Styles, Flair and Desmond Wolfe. The storyline became a Team Flair versus Team Hogan situation, with Jarrett and the debuting Rob Van Dam joining Team Hogan and Beer Money (James Storm and Robert Roode) and Sting joining Team Flair. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) in a Lethal Lockdown match.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. A:","completion":"Which of the following findings were revealed in the recent study about teens' sleep quality?

Please answer the following question: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the... .The following aspects of the training help increase intelligence EXCEPT _ .

But in a small corner of Tehran, a surprising display of unofficial Disney diplomacy seems to fly in the face of official anti-American rhetoric. Visitors to Eram Park, in the west of the capital, are greeted with numerous images of Disney characters, as well as other familiar American cartoon characters such as Shrek. Elsewhere, outside of the city, is another unexpected sight: A club dedicated to the U.S.-invented Segway people transporters. For roller coaster obsessive and self-styled \\"Theme Park Guy\\" Stefan Zwanzger, who toured Tehran's funfairs last month, the presence of these American icons offered more thrills than the rides on offer. \\"You see badly-copied Mickeys and Donald Ducks all over the world, for example in copycat theme parks in rural China, but I didn't expect to see Shrek and Segways in Iran,\\" Zwanzger told CNN. A German citizen now living in Stockholm, Sweden, Zwanzger, 32, could be forgiven for having preconceptions when visiting Iran. Nuclear ambitions, major protests after President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad's disputed 2009 election victory and frequent reports of repression have all done little for the country's global reputation. But, says Zwanzger -- whose four-year quest to visit all the world's major theme parks has so far taken him to 150 on five continents -- the Iran he encountered seemed a world away from the grim headlines. He says the Iranians he encountered were \\"open-minded, unprejudiced, hospitable, warm and cultured,\\" sharing views that appeared to contrast with those expressed by the country's leaders. \\"What surprised me is that I didn't even get the slightest cultural shock. The Iranians I met made me feel like I was in Europe,\\" he said. His views reflect a 2008 WorldPublicOpinion.org survey that claims ordinary Iranian people are largely open to contacts with Westerners. Nevertheless, countries such as Britain and the U.S., which has no diplomatic relations with Tehran, caution against travel there. International sanctions in place against Iran also mean western companies cannot operate easily in the country. Whereas on the streets of Tehran, U.S. icons such as the Statue of Liberty are used to create striking anti-American graffiti, Zwanzger witnessed Mickey Mouse and his pals being pressed into far less sinister tasks. At Eram Park, Mickey simply welcomes people to the funfair, while the Dwarves urge people to enjoy themselves. Shrek offers tickets to ride and Donald Duck helpfully points to the exit. As with his other experiences of places including North Korea, Zwanzger says Iran's theme parks offer a glimpse of the country's citizens as they relax and forget their day-to-day concerns, even if the rides struggle to merit the low admission fees. \\"I highly recommend Iran as a place to visit. It's a beautiful country with fantastic people. The local amusement parks provide great opportunity to mingle with locals.\\" Sadly, with their rusting roller coasters and \\"drainingly dull\\" side shows, not even the presence of Mickey, Shrek and the Dwarves could save Iran's theme parks from rating badly on Zwanzger's score card. He says one ride, in which visitors are squeezed into a car shaped like a soda can before being hurtled around a cramped roller coaster circuit, could be world-beatingly bad. \\"The yellow soda can-shaped roller coaster in Eram Park -- I'm still trying to find out who the manufacturer was, even my specialist friends don't know -- was maybe the worst I have ever experienced. \\"I was scared. The loop is the tightest I have ever seen and the vehicle's headrests are too low to keep your head stable. You can hear the riders' joyful screams rise when the coaster plunges into the loop and vanish within a second once they enter the murderous brain-turner itself. \\"It was genuinely unpleasant and leaves you with some neck pain to remember.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article describes the surprising presence of American pop culture icons, notably Disney characters like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, at Eram Park, a theme park in Tehran, Iran. This is notably at odds with Iran's official anti-American rhetoric. Other American cultural symbols, such as the U.S.-invented Segway people transporters, also have a surprising presence in the country. Stefan Zwanzger, a German theme park enthusiast, was pleasantly surprised by these discoveries during his visit to Iran's theme parks. He also notes that despite the country's international reputation, prone to talk of nuclear ambitions and repression, he found the everyday Iranian people he met to be \\"open-minded, unprejudiced, hospitable, warm and cultured.\\" This sentiment is supported by a 2008 WorldPublicOpinion.org survey which suggests that ordinary Iranians may be largely open to contacts with Westerners, contrasting with the attitudes of their country's leadership. However, Zwanzger also comments on the poor quality of Iran's theme parks, full of rusting roller coasters and uninteresting attractions, with one ride, a yellow soda can-shaped roller coaster in Eram Park, being called out for its potential danger to the riders' safety due to its poor design. While enthusiastic about the people and the culture he encountered, Zwanzger’s view of Iran’s theme parks themselves is less flattering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, Nama and, since about the 14th century AD, by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion from central Africa. From the late 18th century onwards, Orlam clans from the Cape Colony crossed the Orange River and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia. Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. The missionaries accompanying the Orlams were well received by them, the right to use waterholes and grazing was granted against an annual payment. On their way further northwards, however, the Orlams encountered clans of the Herero tribe at Windhoek, Gobabis, and Okahandja which were less accommodating. The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only when Imperial Germany deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo between Nama, Orlams, and Herero.

Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the \\"jugular vein of the Empire\\". In 1875, the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma'il Pasha's 44 percent shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (£340 million in 2013). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882. The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position, but a compromise was reached with the 1888 Convention of Constantinople, which made the Canal officially neutral territory.

We have the math problem: -4*h - 57 = 63 - 124 Step 1: First, let's do the subtraction on the right side of the equation: 63 - 124 = -61 Now our equation looks like this: -4*h - 57 = -61 Step 2: Now let's get the -57 from the left side to the right side. We do this by adding 57 to both sides: -4*h - 57 + 57 = -61 + 57 Since -57 + 57 equals 0, our equation becomes: -4*h = -4 Step 3: Now, we just have to find the value of h by dividing both sides by -4: -4*h / -4 = -4 / -4 When we divide -4 by -4, we get 1, so our equation becomes: h = 1 So the answer is h = 1.

It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop.The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: \\"We use the older effects because they're more direct, more extreme, and they're more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.\\" The 1994 album Mars Audiac Quintet prominently features Moog synthesizers. Lætitia Sadier's English and French vocals was a part of Stereolab's music since the beginning; and would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in Wire that Sadier \\"display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico\\", while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as \\"eerie\\" and \\"hypnotic\\", as well as \\"sweet [and] slightly alien\\". After Hansen's death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab's older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen's backing vocals.In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that \\"to be unique was more important than to be good.\\" On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that \\"maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we're doing.\\" Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she \\"think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not.\\" The duo were up-front about their... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who died in 2002?, what is it ?

Given the question: Given the background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. and the situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. Answer the following question: What city is contributing less to global warming? The answer is:","completion":"Springfield, a city in the United States, is contributing less to global warming compared to Nillmar, a city in France. This conclusion is based on the primary sources of electricity generation utilized by both cities. Nillmar primarily relies on coal-powered plants for its electricity production, which involves burning coal and other fossil fuels. The combustion of these fuels results in the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and other pollutants. These emissions contribute to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Additionally, the finite nature of fossil fuels raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of this energy source. In contrast, Springfield is powered by nuclear fission-based electricity generation. While the radioactive elements used in nuclear fission are also limited, this process does not produce air pollution or emit significant greenhouse gases. Nuclear fission provides a cleaner source of energy than fossil fuels, as it does not release harmful chemicals and pollutants that contribute to environmental problems like global warming. Based on this information, the alien would likely conclude that Springfield is a more environmentally friendly city in terms of its energy production. By utilizing nuclear power as its primary energy source, Springfield considerably reduces the negative impacts associated with greenhouse gas emissions that are prevalent in Nillmar's coal-driven electricity generation. As a result, Springfield contributes less to global warming and its potential adverse consequences on Earth's climate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: It is a common belief that the Private Express Statutes and the mailbox rule serve as protection to allow universal service at uniform rates. Hypothesis: The Private Express Statutes have no affect on universal service at uniform rates. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we first need to provide some background information about the Private Express Statutes and the mailbox rule, and then analyze the relationship between them and the concept of universal service at uniform rates. Background Information: 1. Private Express Statutes: The Private Express Statutes are a set of U.S. federal regulations designed to grant the United States Postal Service (USPS) a monopoly over the carriage and delivery of letter mail. The purpose of these statutes is to maintain the revenue of the USPS, which supports its ability to provide universal service at uniform rates. These statutes primarily restrict private carriers, such as FedEx or UPS, from delivering specific types of letter mail. 2. Mailbox Rule: The mailbox rule is another aspect of the USPS's legal monopoly. According to this rule, only the USPS may deliver mail to residential and business mailboxes. This further protects the USPS's revenue stream by ensuring that it remains the primary carrier and deliverer of mail, thus helping to finance universal service at uniform rates. 3. Universal Service at Uniform Rates: Universal service is the principle that all Americans should have access to postal services, regardless of their geographic location or ability to pay for such services. The USPS must abide by this principle and provide mail delivery services at a uniform (consistent) rate across the country, despite the varying costs of delivery in different regions. Analysis: The premise states that the Private Express Statutes and the mailbox rule serve as protection to allow universal service at uniform rates. In other words, these two regulations act as safeguards to preserve USPS's monopoly on mail delivery and ensure the viability of mail delivery across the country at consistent rates. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the Private Express Statutes have no effect on universal service at uniform rates. This essentially suggests that these statutes don't contribute to maintaining the delivery of postal services across the country at consistent rates. Now let's examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis: If the premise is true and the Private Express Statutes and the mailbox rule play a protective role in ensuring universal service at uniform rates, then the hypothesis, which claims the Private Express Statutes have no effect on this principle, would be false. This is because the premise states that these statutes serve as protection to maintain consistent delivery rates and services across the country, whereas the hypothesis denies this relationship. Based on this reasoning, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. Instead, the premise and hypothesis are contradictory. The premise affirms the role of the Private Express Statutes in ensuring universal service at uniform rates, while the hypothesis denies this role. Consequently, the truthfulness of the premise does not lead to the validity of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

So, after understanding the context and question, you have to decide which of these three actions aligns most accurately with Riley's potential next step. Part #4: Use commonsense reasoning about social situations. Usage: Riley was hungry and ate a steak. Commonsensically, people who have just eaten, especially a heavy dish like steak, might not feel the need to eat more immediately after. Therefore, Riley might not want to do option (A), \\"get food.\\" Part #5: Give an output corresponding to the answer. Usage: After considering all the options, this task requires choosing one that seems most likely given the context and common sense reasoning. For example, \\"B\\" or \\"relax at home\\" could be a reasonable answer as one is likely to relax at home after having a meal and a day of work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Men are attracted to her, including boss Victor Kranish, wealthy advertiser Felix Courtland and a former assistant, Jack Garet, who is now working for Courtland and blackmailing her about events from her past. Madeleine makes a suicide attempt and is headed toward a breakdown. She crashes her car near the home of a psychiatrist, then, while under his care, quits her job and moves into a smaller flat under a new identity. She becomes interested in painting and in David Cousins, a handsome neighbor. After having marriage proposed to her by David, who knows nothing of her past, Madeleine is confronted by Courtland, who is still interested in her. After she slips away from his home, Garet arrives. Accused of a home burglary by Courtland, Garet bludgeons him with a table lighter. Madeleine is charged with the murder and is too depressed to defend herself. David realizes the truth, confronts Garet and manages to save Madeleine just in time. Answer:","completion":"The movie plot provided describes a thrilling tale of romance, turmoil, and mystery. The protagonist, Madeleine Damien, navigates a complex network of relationships, guilt, and fear. She is a high-profile fashion editor in Manhattan whose life spirals out of control, leading her towards a breakdown and even to the point of attempting suicide. Amidst her struggle, her interaction with different characters including her boss Victor Kranish, the advertiser Felix Courtland, her former assistant Jack Garet, and her admirer David Cousins, introduces mysteries and suspense that culminates in a murder in which Madeleine is implicated. There are numerous questions that could be asked from this plot. One possible question would be: \\"How does Madeleine Damien's journey from a glamorous fashion editor to a murder suspect reflect her struggles with her past, her relationships, and her mental health, and how do the characters of Victor Kranish, Felix Courtland, Jack Garet, and David Cousins influence her life and the outcomes of this journey?\\" This question is significant because it encompasses various elements of the plot. We can examine Madeleine's life transition from a high-society fashion editor to a person dealing with trauma and depression that leads to her being a murder suspect. It also invites a closer look into how her relationships and interactions with key individuals in the plot have shaped her life and the series of events. We can break down this complex question into several sub-questions: 1. What led to Madeleine's mental breakdown and her suicide attempt? 2. How did Madeleine's relationships with Victor Kranish, Felix Courtland, and Jack Garet influence her life and decisions? 3. In what ways did the blackmail from her former assistant, Jack Garet, about events of her past affect Madeleine? 4. How did Madeleine's encounter with the psychiatrist and her subsequent change of identity affect her mental health and overall life trajectory? 5. How did Madeleine's interest in painting and the influence of David Cousins impact her life's turn? 6. What role did David Cousins play in Madeleine's life and how did his proposal of marriage to her, despite not knowing her past, influence the series of events including the confrontation with Courtland and Garet? 7. How did Madeleine become implicated in Courtland's murder and what was her reaction to the charges against her? 8. How did David Cousins help save Madeleine from her predicament and what does this say about his character and his relationship with her? By exploring these sub-questions, we will be able to provide a comprehensive answer to the larger question, shedding light on the various dimensions of the plot and the character development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes. Question: suppose more water droplets are formed happens, how will it affect LESS snow. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"It seems that you have mentioned the process of snowflake formation and are interested in understanding how an increase in the number of water droplets may affect the overall production of snow. Let me first summarize the process of snowflake formation and then discuss the effects of increased water droplets. The process of snowflake formation starts with the evaporation of water from the ground, bodies of water, and plants, which then rises upwards into the atmosphere. As the water vapor gets higher, it comes into contact with cool air and condenses into tiny droplets, which, when they reach the colder, higher-altitude clouds, freeze into tiny ice crystals. These ice crystals eventually stick together and form snowflakes as they collide with each other due to air currents and turbulence. Now let's consider the case where more water droplets are formed. The water droplet formation is influenced by various factors, including humidity, air pressure, and temperature. Greater numbers of water droplets can result from an increase in humidity (more moisture in the air), a decrease in air pressure (which allows for more efficient droplet nucleation), or changes in temperature (with colder temperatures favoring droplet formation). With an increased number of water droplets present in the clouds, it may be helpful to analyze the subsequent effects on snow production. Bear in mind that precipitation, whether in the form of snow, rain, hail, or sleet, is determined by various factors, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and weather patterns. 1. More droplets could result in more ice crystals: By providing more droplets for ice formation, the potential number of ice crystals could increase, eventually leading to a larger number of snowflakes. This could potentially lead to more snow, although many factors could also counteract or alter this effect. 2. Resource competition and lower efficiency: The presence of more water droplets may cause competition for the properties that promote ice nucleation and crystal growth, such as suitable aerosols and dust in the atmosphere. In this scenario, increased droplets could reduce the overall efficiency of these processes, leading to a decrease in snow production. 3. Changing weather patterns: The formation of more water droplets may alter weather patterns that affect precipitation. For instance, densely packed water droplets can cause local cloud cover to become thicker, engendering a shift in prevailing winds. The resultant changes in cloud distribution could affect the production and deposition of snow in various locations by influencing the location and intensity of snowstorms. In conclusion, the effect of more water droplets on snow production is not a straightforward, one-dimensional relationship. It is a complex interaction of various factors, and the end result of either more or less snow would largely depend on the interplay of these variables. Climate models and meteorological studies can shed further light on such relationships, and it is through these tools that more accurate predictions and understanding of these processes can be gained."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Media caption Cindy Sui speaks to Taiwanese students holding a rally to demonstrate their support for the protests in Hong Kong In January, 13 groups from Hong Kong and Taiwan gathered in Taipei for a weekend conference. The meeting attracted little attention, but it marked the first time democracy advocates, including representatives from Hong Kong's political parties and students from both sides, had met in an organised fashion. Despite their proximity, the two sides previously worked little together. Taiwan has enjoyed full universal suffrage since 1996; but a year later, Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule. It seemed they had different fates. Growing worries about Beijing have drawn the two sides closer, however, culminating in mutual support for the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong and an Occupy Parliament movement in Taipei earlier this year. \\"Taiwan's democracy and Hong Kong's democracy have the same threat - the Beijing government,\\" said Lai Chung-chiang, a Taipei-based lawyer and long-time activist. Image copyright AFP Image caption Students present John Leung, director of Hong Kong Trade Office in Taipei, with a protest letter on 29 Sep Now the two sides feel they share similar goals and they are working together more closely, something that will surely worry Beijing. Hong Kong supported us and now we're supporting them Karen Cheng, Taiwanese activist After all, Taiwan could be seen as a bad influence - it's had decades, and some would say more than a century, of experience fighting for democracy. Some of its people are deeply anti-China and want independence, and its protesters have been bolder and more defiant than Hong Kong's. Many believe the success of Taiwan's movement greatly encouraged Hong Kong activists. Two months after the January meeting, Taiwanese students occupied parliament for 24 days and didn't leave until the legislature agreed to pass a law allowing stringent public supervision of agreements signed with China. \\"Because Taiwan's occupy movement was successful, Hong Kong people felt it was also possible for them,\\" said Mr Lai. Many Hong Kong students came here then to learn, including how to disseminate information online in timely manner and co-ordinate supplies and donations. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Student activists organised a protest at the Hong Kong office in Taipei on Monday 'Support each other' In recent days, Taiwanese activists have flown to Hong Kong to lend support. One of them, Karen Cheng, has just returned. \\"We strongly care about Hong Kong because we really cherish our freedom and democracy,\\" said Ms Cheng. \\"We're worried that today's Hong Kong will be tomorrow's Taiwan (if it one day reunifies with the mainland).\\" Beijing should have foreseen these fears as it worked in recent years to woo Taiwan - the next on a list of territories China feels were unfairly taken away when it was weak and wants to take back, to unify the \\"motherland\\". Beijing had hoped that allowing Hong Kong to prosper economically after the 1997 handover would convince Taiwan to reunify. But whether or not it grants Hong Kong democracy will directly affect whether the Taiwanese trust China, much less want to reunify. Image copyright EPA Image caption The protests in Hong Kong have seen thousands of people take to the streets Image copyright Reuters Image caption Some protesters slept on the streets overnight to enforce a blockade of key areas Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent statements that Taiwan should accept the same \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" formula under which Beijing rules Hong Kong, following his refusal to allow Hong Kong people to directly elect their leader, indicate he may be clueless about what Taiwanese people care about the most - self rule. Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou has rejected Mr Xi's suggestion, saying: \\"We fully understand and support Hong Kong's demand for universal suffrage.\\" Giving Hong Kong people the right to choose their own leader would be a \\"win-win\\" situation for Hong Kong and China, he added. But he's limited in how much more he can say. Mr Ma hopes to meet Mr Xi at the Apec leaders' summit in Beijing in November and he doesn't want to jeopardise future negotiations with China. For Beijing, it now has to reckon with two issues it dealt with separately being linked, said Arthur Ding Shu-fan, a research fellow at National Cheng-chi University's Institute of International Relations. \\"They will have to figure out how to reassure Taiwan to not to support Hong Kong,\\" said Mr Ding. It will also likely build a long blacklist of Taiwanese activists to keep out of Hong Kong. Already, student leaders Lin Fei-fan and Chen Wei-ting have been denied entry. But besides them, there are many more people who now feel connected to Hong Kong - no longer seen as just a place for flight transfers or shopping. \\"They supported us (back in March and April) and now we're supporting them,\\" said Ms Cheng. \\"Supporting each other will help both sides.\\" ||||| HONG KONG Thousands of pro-democracy protesters thronged the streets of Hong Kong early on Wednesday, ratcheting up pressure on the pro-Beijing government that has called the action illegal and vowed to press ahead with National Day celebrations. There was little sign of momentum flagging on the fifth day of a determined mass campaign to occupy sections of the city and to express fury at a Chinese decision to limit voters' choices in a 2017 leadership election. That was despite widespread fears that police may use force to move crowds before the start of celebrations marking the anniversary of the Communist Party's foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The crowds have brought large sections of the Asian financial hub to a standstill, disrupting businesses from banks to jewelers. Overnight thunder, lightning and heavy rain failed to dampen spirits as protesters sought shelter under covered walkways, while police in raincoats and hats looked on passively nearby. At dawn on Wednesday, protesters awoke to blue skies. Riot police had used tear gas, pepper spray and baton charges at the weekend to try to quell the unrest but tensions have eased since then as both sides appeared prepared to wait it out, at least for now. Protests spread from four main areas to Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's most popular shopping areas for mainland Chinese, which would normally do roaring trade during the annual National Day holiday. In the early morning hours, hundreds of demonstrators were milling around outside luxury stores and setting up makeshift barricades in anticipation of possible clashes. As in most parts of Hong Kong, the police presence was small. M. Lau, a 56-year-old retiree, said he had taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest in the 1980s and wanted to do so again in a show of solidarity with a movement that has been led by students as well as more established activists. \\"Later this morning I will come back,\\" he said. \\"I want to see more. Our parents and grandparents came to Hong Kong for freedom and the rule of law. This (protest) is to maintain our 160-year-old legal system for the next generation.\\" The protests are the worst in Hong Kong since China resumed its rule of the former British colony in 1997. They also represent one of the biggest political challenges for Beijing since it violently crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Cracking down too hard could shake confidence in market-driven Hong Kong, which has a separate legal system from the rest of China. Not reacting firmly enough, however, could embolden dissidents on the mainland. Underlining nervousness among some activists that provocation on National Day could spark violence, students from Hong Kong University made an online appeal for people not to disturb the flag-raising ceremony set for 8 a.m. (midnight GMT/8.00 p.m. EDT). Hundreds of protesters lined up in the early hours to view the ceremony at Bauhinia Square on the Hong Kong waterfront. Protesters tried to organize a human chain to create a buffer between about 100 police at the site and other demonstrators. \\"We want to be heard, we want to stand here peacefully, but we’re not going to be aggressive,\\" one of the protesters said. ULTIMATUM, BLOCKADES China rules Hong Kong under a \\"one country, two systems\\" formula that accords the former British colony a degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, with universal suffrage set as an eventual goal. However, when Beijing decreed a month ago that it would vet candidates wishing to run for Hong Kong's leadership, protesters reacted angrily and called for Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying to step down. Student leaders had given Leung an ultimatum to come out and address the crowds before midnight on Tuesday, threatening to occupy more of the city if he failed to do so. Leung did not comply but has said Beijing would not back down in the face of protests. He also said Hong Kong police would be able to maintain security without help from People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops from the mainland. Communist Party leaders in Beijing worry that calls for democracy could spread to the mainland, and have been aggressively censoring news and social media comments about the Hong Kong demonstrations. Hong Kong shares fell to a three-month low on Tuesday, registering their biggest monthly fall since May 2012. Markets are closed on Wednesday and Thursday for the holidays. The city's benchmark index has fallen 7.3 percent over the past month, and there are few indications that the protests are likely to end any time soon. Protesters have set up supply stations with water bottles, fruit, crackers, disposable raincoats, towels, goggles, face masks and tents. \\"Even though I may get arrested, I will stay until the last minute,\\" said 16-year-old John Choi. \\"We are fighting for our future.\\" MAINLAND CHINESE VISITORS WATCH ON Mainland Chinese visiting Hong Kong had differing views on the demonstrations, being staged under the \\"Occupy\\" banner. \\"For the first time in my life I feel close to politics,\\" said a 29-year-old Chinese tourist from Beijing who gave only her surname, Yu. \\"This is a historic moment for Hong Kong. I believe something like this will happen in China one day.\\" A woman surnamed Lin, from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, however said the protesters' demands for a democratic election were \\"disrespectful to the mainland\\". \\"Even though the government has brought a lot of development to Hong Kong, they don't acknowledge this,\\" Lin said. The message from Beijing has been clear. The deputy director of China's National People's Congress Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, Li Shenming, wrote in the People's Daily: \\"In today's China, engaging in an election system of one-man-one-vote is bound to quickly lead to turmoil, unrest and even a situation of civil war.\\" The outside world has looked on warily. British finance chief George Osborne urged China to seek peace and said the former colony's prosperity depended on freedom. Washington urged Hong Kong authorities \\"to exercise restraint and for protesters to express their views peacefully\\". U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will discuss the protests with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during talks in Washington on Wednesday, U.S. officials said. The events have also been followed closely in Taiwan, which has full democracy but is considered by Beijing as a renegade province that must one day be reunited with the mainland.

Tear gas and pepper spray met tens of thousands of demonstrators in Hong Kong's Central District Monday, leading to the already iconic use of umbrellas to fend off police tactics. The protests have shut down banks, businesses, and schools and show no sign of letting up. But this weekend may be just a prelude to the unrest to come. On Wednesday, October 1st, China will celebrate its 65th National Day, commemorating the founding of the People's Republic of China and the beginning one of China's two \\"Golden Weeks,\\" where workers are given time off work and travel to see friends and family. But with unrest brewing in Hong Kong, a day off could mean more protesters. \\"The authorities in Beijing are anxious about what will happen, \\" said Masato Hasegawa, a visiting professor of history at NYU. \\"It’s a national holiday and more people will gather.\\" The authorities in Beijing are anxious.\\" In fact, October 1 was the originally planned start date for the mass protests in Hong Kong's central business district. But after a week of student sit-ins and dozens of forcible arrests, University of Hong Kong professor and political organizer Benny Tai announced that \\"Occupy Central\\" would kick off early. On Sunday morning at 1:45 a.m. local time, Tai told a large crowd gathered in central Hong Kong: “I’ve got a long-awaited message. Occupy Central will start now. Students and people who support democracy has begun a new era of civil disobedience.” Even without the potential to spoil a major national holiday, the protests come at an uneasy moment for Beijing. Residents in Macau are rumored to be preparing their own to protest starting Wednesday. Taiwan, meanwhile, saw days of unrest this spring after Beijing attempted to tie the nation closer to China's central economy. This weekend, hundreds took to the streets of Taiwan again in support of those in Hong Kong. At the heart of the issue is Hong Kong's political autonomy. In August, China announced all candidates for Hong Kong's 2017 leadership election must be approved by a nominating committee filled with pro-mainland supporters. As Hong Kong grows less and less important to China's economy, Beijing seems reluctant to alter its decision, especially in the face of public protest. \\"If there’s a possibility for Beijing to make changes and revisions, those changes will come very gradually and behind the scenes,\\" says Hasegawa. \\"I think it’s unlikely to see a public announcement.” Which means comes October 1, many people won't be working and the political situation will remain unresolved. Jay Ulfelder, a political scientist and director of the Early Warning Project, which analyzes the risk of mass killings, said the current unrest is at a delicate tipping point. \\"There's a sequence of points where things can turn one way or the other. Will people show up? Once they show up, will more people show up in response? Then you start getting into the state reacting.\\" If China responds aggressively, now that the protests have gotten this big, they’re going have to get really aggressive. With Beijing backed into a corner, Ulfelder says the Chinese government is forced with a choice. \\"Do they offer concessions or respond aggressively? If China responds aggressively, now that the protests have gotten this big, they’re going have to get really aggressive.\\" Planned celebrations of China's National Day have already been cancelled in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, according to the South China Morning Post, thousands of protestors were still in the streets at 4:49 a.m. local time and manning barricades throughout central Hong Kong (and, in a charming touch, also picking up trash). For Ulfelder, he believes the Chinese government can either try to wait the crowd out—\\"let the local guys have their say\\"—and hope the movement peters out, or it can get tough. But he says it's very unlikely the crowds will go away before October 1st. \\"I have a hard time imagining this dispersing this soon unless there’s a successful large-scale repressive effort by the state.\\" Professor Hasegawa, however, points out that Hong Kong has a long and unique history of peaceful demonstrations. Chinese officials have allowed citizens within Hong Kong to commemorate June 4th, the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre, since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997—something that is still not allowed within mainland China. Hasegawa adds that he hears from colleagues and friends within Hong Kong that the photos coming out of Hong Kong of violent clashes between protestors and police can be deceiving. \\"What I’ve heard from them that these demonstrations are largely peaceful and have a great sense of order within the protestors,\\" he says. \\"And those instances of clashes seem to be the exception at this point to the largely peaceful nature of the demonstrations.\\" ||||| HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's leader said Tuesday that China won't back down from its decision to limit voting reforms in the Asian financial hub, dashing hopes that the standoff between demonstrators and authorities could be resolved quickly through negotiations.

(Associated Press) A student protester rests next to a defaced cut-out of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying at one of their protest sites around the government headquarters, Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2014, in Hong Kong.... (Associated Press) As pro-democracy protests that have blocked Hong Kong's streets entered a fifth day, the unequivocal statement from Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying does not come as a surprise. Showing a willingness to talk would have made the Chinese leadership in Beijing appear weak, which could embolden dissidents and separatists on the mainland. Leung, a Beijing appointee who is deeply mistrusted by the people, said that mainland communist leaders would not reverse their August decision requiring a pro-Beijing panel to screen candidates in the territory's first direct elections, scheduled for 2017. \\"The central government will not rescind its decision,\\" said Leung, adding that he wouldn't step down before then — rejecting one of the protesters' demands. There was no immediate response from Occupy Central, the main civil disobedience group, but said in a tweet that the broader pro-democracy movement had set a Wednesday deadline for Leung meet their demands, which include genuine democracy and his resignation. It said it would \\"announce new civil disobedience plans same day,\\" without elaborating. Despite Leung's urgings that they disperse and go home, thousands of people — many of them university and high school students — gathered on a six-lane highway next to the local government headquarters. The protesters' chief demand is that they don't want Beijing to screen nominees for Hong Kong's leadership elections. They see the central government as reneging on a promise that the chief executive would eventually be chosen through \\"universal suffrage.\\" \\"The people on the streets are here because we've made the decision ourselves and we will only leave when we have achieved something,\\" said Chloe Cheung, a 20-year-old student at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. \\"We are waiting for the government to respond to our demands for democracy and a say in what the elections will be like.\\" Student leaders planned to make their own announcement Tuesday about further plans and demands. Even larger crowds are expected to flood the streets Wednesday, China's National Day holiday. The government said it was canceling a fireworks display to mark the day. On Sunday, police shocked the city by firing tear gas at crowds, but protesters passed a peaceful night Monday singing as they blocked streets in several parts of Hong Kong. Crowds chanted calls for Leung to resign, and sang anthems calling for freedom. Police said they used 87 rounds of tear gas Sunday in what they called a necessary but restrained response to protesters pushing through cordons and barricades. They said 41 people were injured, including 12 police officers. \\"Police cordon lines were heavily charged by some violent protesters. So police had to use the minimum force in order to separate the distance at that moment between the protesters and also the police,\\" said Cheung Tak-keung, the assistant police commissioner for operations. Officials announced that schools in some districts of Hong Kong would remain closed Tuesday because of safety concerns, while dozens of bus routes were canceled and some subway stops near protest areas were closed. The protests have been dubbed the \\"Umbrella Revolution\\" by some, because the crowds have used umbrellas to not only block the sun, but also to deflect police pepper spray. Political slogans calling for freedom have also been written on the umbrellas. Many younger Hong Kong residents raised in an era of plenty and with no experience of past political turmoil in mainland China have higher expectations. Under an agreement set in 1984, before most of them were born, Beijing promised to allow Hong Kong residents civil liberties — unseen in the rest of China — after it took control of the city in 1997. China's communist leaders take a hard line against any threat to their monopoly on power, including clamping down on dissidents and Muslim Uighur separatists in the country's far west, but it cannot crack down too harshly on the semi-autonomous territory where a freewheeling media ensures global visibility. Across the border, Chinese state media have provided scant coverage of the protests beyond noting that an illegal gathering spun out of control and was being curtailed by police. ___ Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan, Louise Watt and Joanna Chiu contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"In January 2014, 13 groups from Hong Kong and Taiwan gathered in Taipei to demonstrate mutual support for the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong and an Occupy Parliament movement in Taipei.

Growing worries about Beijing have drawn the two sides closer, however, culminating in mutual support for the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong and an Occupy Parliament movement in Taipei earlier this year. The closer relationship between Hong Kong and Taiwan threatens Beijing, as Taiwan has more experience fighting for their democracy and independence.

He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums).

Take the example of Anheuser-Busch and SABMiller, which essentially own the American beer market. While the two corporate giants produce and sell beers like Budweiser and Miller, they have created beer brands like Blue Moon and Shock Top that mimic America’s craft breweries, which are surging in popularity. Similarly, as Martin Lindstrom points out in Brandwashed, Whole Foods lists prices for its fruits and vegetables on what appear to be chalkboards. The implication is that prices change regularly as if responding to local crop conditions. In fact, the prices are permanently printed on the faux chalkboards, which are part of a marketing strategy meant to “evoke the image of Grapes of Wrath-era laborers piling box after box of fresh fruit into the store.” But in a world full of manipulative marketers, the truffle is the real deal. A type of fungus that grows on tree roots, the truffle stands on the right side of the line between decomposition and decadence. While many are viewed as almost worthless, a few truffle varieties found in France, Spain, and surrounding areas are esteemed as a decadent addition to pasta, steaks, and foie gras. These truffles help dishes “jump off the plate” with an aroma that one admiring chef has compared to a locker room. These fickle cousins of mushrooms have proven impossible to mass produce; they are still dug up individually by dogs that track their scent. The truffle stands in stark contrast to our era of convenience: the preservatives in bread that allow it to stay fresh for weeks and the year-round availability of seasonal fruits and vegetables. Admirers contend that the truffle begins to lose its flavor as soon as it is pulled from the ground, and fresh truffle season really only lasts a season. The rarity and temporality of truffles has made them—at €4,400 to €11,000 per pound for Italy’s prized white truffles—the most expensive food in the world. In 2007, a Macau casino owner set a record by paying 330,000 for a 3.3 pound truffle unearthed in Tuscany. The combination of these two trends—the desire for a convenient, ever-ready supply of an ingredient, and a hunger for the traditional, the rare, and “real food”—led to what would seem to be a remarkably successful scam on foodie culture: truffle oil. Despite the name, most truffle oil does not contain even trace amounts of truffle; it is olive oil mixed with 2,4-dithiapentane, a compound that makes up part of the smell of truffles and is as associated with a laboratory as Californian food is associated with local and organic ingredients. Essentially, truffle oil is olive oil plus truffles’ “disconcerting” smell. Despite truffle oil's poor provenance, though, it has been used and praised by both average joes and renowned chefs. Truffle oil has been a remarkably successful con. A Culinary Gem If today’s ubiquitous food bloggers share a common ancestor, it is Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a French politician who survived the French Revolution to invent the self-indulgent food essay. His 1825 book, The Physiology of Taste, is widely cited for calling truffles “the diamond of the kitchen.” Brillat-Savarin also asks a question common among foodies and the non-initiated alike: why are truffles so popular? The truffle “is not only delicious to taste,” Brillat-Savarin writes, “but is also believed to foster powers the exercise whereof is eminently pleasurable.” If it’s unclear, he’s talking about sex. Although Brillat-Savarin could only find one woman who would relate a story of falling under the spell of truffles, he did convene a panel of men of “unimpeachable integrity” who concluded, “The truffle is not a positive aphrodisiac, but it can upon occasion make women tenderer and men more apt to love.” The other reason for truffles’ popularity, then and now, is its rarity. In his account, Brillat-Savarin bemoans that attempts to cultivate the truffle were unsuccessful, although he then concedes, “Perhaps this is no great misfortune… it may be that [truffles] would be held in less esteem were they multiplied and made cheap.” On one hand, this is snob appeal, which the French writer compares to a fashionable Parisian lady who would refuse to wear lace if it suddenly became cheap. The cost of truffles from places like China and the United States are more on par with ordinary mushrooms in terms of prices. Critics write that this is because they are not nearly as good. But it is worth asking whether at least some of the difference is merely that France and Italy enjoy reputations at the top of the cultural and culinary hierarchies. On the other hand, it’s the almost inevitable psychology of wanting what you can’t have. This author remembers his disappointment when a waitress took his order of Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon—a coveted and hard to find whiskey—without comment. It seemed too easy, too mundane. Only when the waitress returned and said, “Sorry, we’re out. Try back in a couple of months” did the liquor regain its legendary halo. Although truffles cannot be mass produced, people can engage in “trufficulture” by planting more of the trees on which it tends to grow. (This is less true of Italian white truffles, which makes them more expensive.) In the late 18th and early 19th century, truffles became a widely praised part of French cuisine as hunters and dealers sprang up to dig up truffles and get them to market. In the early 20th century, French trufficulture efforts helped meet growing demand. Since then, however, the cumulative impact of two world wars, urbanization and deforestation, and global warming, which reduces the amount of moisture in truffle producing regions below what the fungus needs, have all led the production of black truffles in France to decline from roughly 1,320 tons in 1910 to 32 tons today. Given this decline in truffle production, and the huge increase in demand as faster transportation made fresh truffles a global market, it’s no surprise that the price of truffles is so high. Both black French truffles and white Italian truffles cost thousands of dollars per pound, with plenty of variation depending on the quality of the season and the specific variety. And those astronomical prices have led to some very shady behavior. A Culinary Drug Since truffles grow so inconsistently, companies cannot simply plant orchards of trees that produce the fungus. Even Urbani Truffle, the largest supplier of truffles, which claims to have a 70% share of the market, relies on freelance truffle hunters who scour the countryside. This means that truffle hunting is one of the largest and most profitable treasure hunts. And treasure hunts turn everyone into pirates. The location of trees that often produce truffles is a valuable secret—a piece of knowledge that some truffle hunters may only reveal to their sons on their deathbed, as related by one member of the truffle industry to The Atlantic. But everyone still relies on trained dogs to find the exact location of ripe truffles. (Hunters once used pigs, but as the pigs loved truffles as much as humans, truffle hunters were known to lose fingers as they tried to keep pigs from eating the truffles.) This has led competitors to steal other hunters’ dogs or to leave poisoned meatballs near truffle trees to kill dogs and weed out the competition. Many thieves take a more direct route and simply steal truffles from suppliers to sell on the black market. When 60 Minutes investigated in 2010, they interviewed chefs who said the mafia would steal their truffles. Businesses have also taken to disguising Chinese truffles, which are regarded as inferior and have long been dug up to use as animal feed, as the real thing. Some distributors mix a few Chinese truffles in with each shipment, like “cutting flour into cocaine,” as 60 Minutes put it, while a few French businessmen (likely headed for the deepest circle of French Hell) sell boxes of Chinese truffles labelled “French Black Truffles.” These types of shady dealings infuriate chefs and gourmands, who worry about truffles’ reputation and the quality of the product they receive. Yet at the same time, chefs have been completely complicit in the use of truffle oil, which is essentially truffle-scented olive oil. And it’s a partial, artificially-created scent that led one writer to quip that \\"Comparing truffle oil to real truffles is like comparing sniffing dirty underwear to having sex.\\" Trifling Truffles Beef tenderloin made with truffle oil, which comes from the world's most expensive food. Or does it? Photo credit: Grand Velas Truffle oil was not always a con. Historically, there is at least some mention of Italians infusing olive oils with real truffles, and Urbani Truffles sells truffle oil that it says is made from real truffles. In the 1980s, however, as truffles took off as a global luxury, large companies without any access to actual truffles began to mass produce truffle oil by artificially adding the smell of truffles to olive oil. With the truffle part of the oil coming out of a laboratory rather than the earth, companies mass produced the product and sold it for around 6 a bottle. Using science to make a luxury item available at middle America prices is no crime, but truffle oil always traded on the prestige of real truffles. The oil features phrases like “Product of Italy” and “100% Natural” that suggest the use of real truffles. And if you believe the oil’s critics, rather than imparting some of the earthy flavor of truffles at an affordable prices, truffle oil emits a chemical, gasoline scent that ruins dishes. But everyone still fell for it. Chefs loved truffle oil and used it liberally. For years, promises of truffle oil on fancy menus have indicated sophistication and high prices (an association this author learned without even knowing what a truffle is), and truffle oil was routinely used in no less prestigious and natural ingredients-focused a restaurant than The French Laundry. When chef Daniel Patterson sought to understand why truffle oil continues to thrive, even as its artificial origins have been revealed, he found some pretty cynical answers. The LA Times chief restaurant critic told him, “Chefs use truffle oil because it’s easy to add a gloss of glamour with it—and because it helps sell dishes.” Another chef explained that he adds the oil to dishes that already contain truffle so that people notice the truffle. People expect something big with truffles, and using enough truffle to be sure it’s noticed would be prohibitively expensive. This author has never tasted truffles, but reading accounts like these make it hard to believe the hype. If truffles are so amazing, why do they need to be “enhanced” with truffle oil’s artificial flavor, and why can they so easily be approximated by a 10 bottle of olive oil? But as we’ve written about in previous articles, taste is a slippery concept that is susceptible to psychological trickery and difficult to discuss objectively. Many embarrassed gourmands have realized that they were equating true truffles with smelly olive oil, but amateurs and experts alike easily confuse the good stuff and the cheap stuff whether it’s wine, sushi, or chicken picatta. Many chefs perpetuated the truffle oil fraud inadvertently, assuming it contained real truffles out of a desire to believe. Chef Patterson concedes to happily using truffle oil for years despite the many warning signs (the oil’s price didn’t fluctuate with real truffle prices; white and black truffle oil cost the same even though white truffles are much more expensive) while he espoused a natural ingredients philosophy. He also notes that some chefs are still surprised to hear truffle oil contains no truffles, and writes, “Much as I did for years, chefs want to believe. Stories of sightings of natural truffle oil abound, like a gourmand’s answer to the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus.” Truffles are the world’s most expensive food because they resist all our efforts to control them. They cannot be mass produced or meaningfully eaten out of season. In a world in which we’ve grown increasingly accustomed to the idea that enough money can satisfy any whim, truffles are growing increasingly scarce. (The owner of Urbani Truffles tells stories of rich clients throwing tantrums when a bad year of weather means restaurants can’t serve them truffles.) Truffle oil promised both the allure of truffles and convenience. But it was truffle's resistance to convenience and mass production that made them rare and exciting in the first place.

Between October and March, Trabocchi offers black winter truffles, which grow in the wild and can be cultivated on plantations in Italy and, most famously, near Périgord, France. During the short seasons, a coterie of the world’s gourmet chefs, celebrities, and business moguls compete over a limited supply, which has grown scarcer over the years because of the increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall that climate change has brought to the world’s best truffle-growing regions. Trabocchi works exclusively with suppliers he’s developed a relationship with over the years, and even then, he subjects them to a certain amount of interrogation. “I always ask the source of the truffles. I always ask when they landed into the United States,” Trabocchi said. But both producers and buyers who do not exercise the same caution are vulnerable. The high-end industry has spawned a shadowy underworld, where tax evasion, nighttime heists, counterfeits, and sabotage are not uncommon. The schemes span continents and truffle types, but all of them boil down to scarcity and cash. “You know, it’s a short season. And for some people that make their profit within very tiny windows of the span of an entire 12 months, it’s very important that they’re making the best out of it,” Trabocchi said. “Therefore, sometimes, maybe [cash motivates] people to do things that are not completely legitimate.” According to Bruno Capanna, the president of the truffle foraging association in Acqualagna (one of Italy’s most productive truffle-growing areas), white truffles typically retail for between €2,000 and €5,000 per kilogram (or between 2,753 and 6,883). Top black winter truffles go for between €1,500 to €3,000 per kilogram. The demand for truffles, which is especially high around the holiday season, tends to outpace the supply. And competition for product from renowned areas like Alba, Italy (the Mecca of white truffles) and Périgord, France (home to the best winter blacks) can be even fiercer. “It’s a very well-sought-after ingredient [for] any fine-dining establishment, all over the world, even if they’re not Italian restaurants,” Trabocchi said. “It’s like you’re buying, I don’t know, the price is caviar, but it’s only available from September to January,” he added, referring to the whites. In November, an anonymous bidder from Hong Kong—purportedly a “‘famous Chinese writer’”—placed a call by satellite phone to a white truffle auction at a castle in Italy’s Piedmont region and shelled out 120,000, or three times the price of gold, for two pieces weighing a total of just over two pounds. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was gifted an 8,000 specimen from the same auction, which he promptly gave away to a local school. In 2012, after Jay-Z dropped more than 20,000 at Alba’s local truffle haunts, traders speculated that he could do for their market what he did for Cristal champagne. The rapper P. Diddy once demanded that New York-based French chef Daniel Boulud “shave that bitch” onto his plate. And back in 2010, Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho spent 330,000 on two pieces that weighed 2.87 pounds. Various attempts to explain the value of the fungus have veered into farcical territory. Writing in Time, food writer Josh Ozersky once described its scent as “a combination of newly plowed soil, fall rain, burrowing earthworms and the pungent memory of lost youth and old love affairs.” New York City chef and Food Network notable Alex Guarnaschelli told Ozersky: \\"It conjures up images of a locker room. But the aroma deceptively conceals their complex yet delicate taste. They are sublime.\\" The aroma is so unique, Trabocchi said, that a few slices sprinkled over a simple dish can generate a transcendent, “sort of umami experience.” “When you use truffles in general, my philosophy is that you don’t need anything else,” he said. “The truffle is the star of the dish. [While] there’s nothing wrong [with slicing] some black truffle over a beautifully cooked piece of beef or over foie gras to make the indulgence of a very extremely high level, I think that especially when you use white truffle or winter black truffle ... they just solely need to showcase themselves in a simple preparation.” At Fiola, that’s exactly what he offers, and at a comparatively practical price of 85. Epicureans can enjoy it shaved over their choice of the Piedmont region’s classic pairs: freshly made and generously buttered Tajarin noodles, a simple Parmesan risotto, or a few farm-raised eggs. Customers can also swallow with at least some certainty that shady truffle bandits haven’t tainted their bite. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Restaurant workers have shared on Reddit some of the \\"gross\\" practices that happen at their workplaces, which they themselves would never eat.

We sat nestled between the entrance and the hostess desk so that half of the table had the privilege of scooting our chairs for other parties being seated farther in the back, and the other table got to sit with the 3 hostesses' booties on their neck all evening. We ordered drinks which were refilled only once during our pleasant 2 hour stay. Our orders were taken about 30 minutes from our being seated, but we didn't receive our food for another hour. These are not my feelings, these are the cold, hard facts. Cold and hard like the 26 fried chicken my husband ordered. His mashed potatoes were a soupy consistency. I have a picture if you wanna see. My ABC Chicken sandwich was okay, the C stands for caramelized onions, but it was cold by the time I got a hold of it so they were more like soggy worms. Okay, that's not a fact, I don't know what worms are like but I can imagine. More facts: Someone in our party ordered a burger with no pink, but when he bit into it it was still bloody. The waiter did pop by 30 minutes later and asked if he wanted it remade but everyone's bubble had been burst by then. I told the manager I wasn't happy with my experience or the quality of the food. She was offended when I compared it to Red Robin, but I've never had a cold meal or left dissatisfied, so I think I did Red Robin a disservice by comparing these two. Sorry big red bird. After the manager got over her indignation, she comped us a sundae. So our party of 8 shared a sundae. Kudos lady, thanks. I felt bad that my family wasted time and money here.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Now, I have a new situation: two buildings had different tenants. Building Y had many seniors over 65 years of age, and building X had individuals under 65 years old. Answer this question please: Which building had fewer people that had Alzheimer's? The answer is:","completion":"Building X had fewer people with Alzheimer's. Step by step reasoning: 1. From the provided background information, it is known that diseases such as Alzheimer's disease become more common during old age. 2. Old age is defined as the period starting from mid-60s until the end of life. 3. Building Y has tenants who are over 65 years old, meaning that they fall into the category of being in old age. 4. Building X has tenants who are under 65 years old, meaning that they fall into the category of not being in old age. 5.

Article: Babies who watch TV are more likely to show late learning development and language at 14 months, especially if they are watching programs aimed at adults and older children, according to a new study, which would probably surprise those parents who leave their babies in front of a TV set. Babies who watched 60 minutes of TV daily had developmental scores a third lower at 14 months than babies who were watching less TV. Although their developmental scores were still in the normal range, the difference may have been due to the fact that when children and parents are watching TV, they are missing the talking, playing and other communications that are important to learning and development. This new study, which appeared in the Aechives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, followed 259 lower-income families in New York, most of whom spoke Spanish as their primary language at home. Other studies of higher-income families have also come to the same conclusion: TV watching is not only non-educational, but it seems to slow down babies' development. But what about \\"good\\" TV, like Sesame Street? The researchers didn't find any difference when compared to non-educational programs designed for small children, like Spongebob SquarePants. Earlier research by some of the same scientists, most of whom are at New York University School of Medicine's Bellevue Hospital Centre, has found that parents whose children watch non-educational TV programs like Spongebob SquarePants spend less time reading to their children or teaching them. At this point, parents reading this will probably be astonished. TV is so often a parent's good friend, keeping children happily occupied so that the adults can cook dinner, answer the phone, or take a shower.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? forget","completion":"The phrase \\"forget\\" can be considered to have both positive and negative connotations depending on the context in which it is used. Let us examine the various aspects that illustrate how this phrase can be perceived in both positive and negative ways. 1. Positive connotations: - Letting go of unhealthy attachments: In the context of personal development and emotional health, the phrase \\"forget\\" can be perceived as a positive suggestion. It encourages individuals to let go of negative emotions, unhealthy relationships, or past experiences that may be preventing their growth, allowing them to move forward and make progress in life. - Forgiveness and healing: In interpersonal relationships, the act of forgetting can be an essential component of forgiveness and healing. When two individuals have experienced a conflict, forgetting the incident or hurtful remarks can show the willingness to move forward without holding a grudge, thus improving the relationship. - Reducing stress and anxiety: Forgetting can be seen as a coping mechanism that helps individuals avoid experiencing unnecessary stress and anxiety. It can help people focus on the present moment and prioritize the important aspects of their lives, rather than dwelling on past mistakes or worrying about future events. 2. Negative connotations: - Ignorance or neglect: In some contexts, the phrase \\"forget\\" may be associated with ignorance or neglect. For instance, if someone forgets an important responsibility or task, it may lead to negative consequences, such as a significant loss or missed opportunity. Forgetting important dates, events, or commitments can also be perceived as a lack of care or consideration for others. - Emotional pain and loss: The act of forgetting can be negatively related to the experience of emotional pain and loss, such as forgetting a cherished memory, the death of a loved one, or a severed connection with someone special. In these cases, the phrase conveys a sense of sadness and longing for what has been lost. - Cognitive decline or memory issues: In the realms of cognitive health and aging, the phrase \\"forget\\" may carry negative implications related to memory problems or cognitive decline. Forgetting may be associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or amnesia, which can have broad implications for the person's quality of life and overall well-being. In conclusion, the perception of the phrase \\"forget\\" as positive or negative largely depends on the context in which it is used and the specific circumstances surrounding its application. It can represent personal growth, forgiveness, and stress reduction, but it may also signify neglect, emotional pain, or cognitive decline. To clearly identify its intended meaning, one must analyze the situation, the speaker's intentions, and the potential consequences of the act of forgetting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (often stylized as P!nk), is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress. She was signed to her first record label with original R&B girl group, Choice, in 1995. The label, LaFace Records, saw great potential in Pink, offering her a solo deal. Choice disbanded in 1998. Alecia Beth Moore was born on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, to emergency room nurse Judith \\"Judy\\" Moore (nee Kugel) and insurance salesman James \\"Jim\\" Moore. Her father is Catholic (of Irish and German descent) and her mother is Jewish (of Lithuanian Jewish and German Jewish descent). She has described herself as an \\"Irish-German-Lithuanian-Jew\\", and self-identifies as Jewish. Although a healthy baby at birth, she quickly developed asthma that plagued her through her early years. Pink attended Central Bucks High School West. When Pink was a toddler, her parents began having marital problems, and before she was 10, her parents had divorced. Pink developed her voice early in life. In high school, Pink joined her first band, Middleground, but it disbanded upon losing a battle of the bands competition. As a teenager, she wrote lyrics as an outlet for her feelings, and her mother commented, \\"Her initial writings were always very introspective. Some of it was very black, and very deep, almost worrisome.\\" Pink began performing in Philadelphia clubs when she was about 14. She adopted her stagename, \\"Pink\\", around this time. She had that nickname for quite some time by that point, and initially it had been \\"a mean thing\\". She had gotten that name from the character \\"Mr. Pink\\" in Quentin Tarantino's film Reservoir Dogs. Pink has said, \\"I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time.\\" At 14, she was convinced to audition to become a member of the all-female group Basic Instinct, and earned a spot in the lineup. Ultimately, the group disbanded without releasing any material. At 16, Pink and two other teenage girls, Stephanie Galligan and Chrissy Conway, formed the R&B group Choice. A copy of their first song, \\"Key to My Heart\\", was sent to LaFace Records in Atlanta, Georgia, where L.A. Reid overheard it and arranged for the group to fly there so he could see them perform. After that, he signed them to a record deal. Since the three girls were under 18 at the time, their parents had to cosign the contract. The group relocated to Atlanta and recorded an album, which was never released, and \\"Key to My Heart\\" appeared on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Kazaam.

Here is a detailed analysis of the possible factors in the context of animal migration, displacement, or relocation: 1. Biome: A biome is a large ecological community of plants and animals that are adapted to living in specific environmental conditions. Changes in a biome, such as alterations in the availability of food, water, and shelter, can push animals to move to another area in search of a more suitable habitat. 2. Motion: The movement of animals can be directly or indirectly influenced by various factors, such as searching for mates, finding new food sources, escaping from predators, or adapting to changes in their environment. 3. Death: Mortality events, such as disease outbreaks or mass die-offs due to natural disasters, can force the surviving animals to move to other areas to seek food, shelter, and suitable habitat for reproduction. 4. Wind: Strong winds have the potential to directly or indirectly impact an animal's movement. Birds and insects, for instance, can be swept up by powerful winds which may carry them to new locations. Additionally, winds can influence the availability of food resources – such as fruits, seeds, and pollen – which might push animals to move to another area to maintain their dietary needs. 5. Autumn: The change of seasons, particularly the transition from summer to autumn, can trigger some species of animals to migrate to different regions in response to the variation in temperature, food availability, and other environmental factors. 6. Storms: Severe weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, can force animals to move to another area to find safety and shelter. Storms can also cause damage to an animal's habitat or significantly change the availability of food resources. 7. Roads: As seen in the original statement, the construction of roads and other human-made infrastructures can disrupt animal habitats and force them to move to another area to adapt to the changes in their environment. This movement can also arise from attempting to avoid dangerous interactions with humans and their vehicles. 8. Deserts: Expanding deserts can displace animal populations, pushing them to seek more hospitable environments with adequate food, water, and shelter resources. Each of these factors, either independently or in combination, can result in animals moving to another area. The specific reason or reasons will depend on the individual species, their ecological requirements, and the particular circumstances of the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If you've ever seen a James Bond movie,you'll know that the hero gets around in a smart Aston Martin car. Even if you know full well that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car. Why? You have been affected by product placement. Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ). Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat. Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies. _ filmmakers often have to give less consideration to the quality of their work because they need money from advertisers. In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor the film. For this reason, the story was changed. In the film the man drinks 20 cups of milk tea instead of eating ice cream. So you may see the power of business over the movies, since the script was perhaps written so that a product could be placed-whether it was ice cream or milk tea. Question: We can learn from the example of Meteor Shower that _ . Answer: Answer:","completion":"We can learn from the example of Meteor Shower that product placement can significantly influence the script and storyline of a movie. The original plot was altered from the heroine's mother owning an ice cream shop to the man drinking 20 cups of milk tea due to the lack of sponsorship from an ice cream company. This exemplifies the power of business and advertising over artistic content in films."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Helen was different from the other kids her age because she dreamed of going on an adventure far, far away. She wanted to travel to outer space!

She spent days dreaming about flying among the stars, floating around like a butterfly, and looking at our round blue Earth from above. She was always excited when she thought about these things. She even had a little toy rocket ship she used to pretend was her spaceship. When Helen grew up, she worked very hard to become an astronaut. An astronaut is someone who travels to space, sort of like a space explorer. And one day, Helen was chosen to go on her first outer space mission! She was super excited, just like the excitement you feel you before going to the zoo or amusement park for the first time. Preparation for the mission took a long time. She had to do lots of training and learning, just like how you learn ABCs and 123s in school. But Helen kept her excitement alive, always looking forward to the day she could go to space. Finally, the big day arrived. Helen climbed into her spaceship, just like she did with her toy rocket when she was a little girl. The engines roared to life, sending powerful vibrations through the ship, just like when a truck roars past your house. During her journey through space, Helen saw beautiful stars, shining planets, and even got to float around inside her spaceship like a butterfly, just as she dreamed. From far above, she looked at Earth, our home, which appeared like a beautiful blue marble. It was the most fascinating view she had ever seen. After a long, exciting journey through the cosmos, Helen returned back to Earth safely. She was delighted, and all her friends, family, and everyone else were very proud of her.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"Three boys are together while one is taking a picture with his camera.\\" if \\"The boys are playing football\\"?","completion":"Although it is possible for the scenario \\"Three boys are together while one is taking a picture with his camera\\" to exist, we cannot conclusively infer this solely from the statement \\"The boys are playing football.\\" To examine the connection between these two scenarios, let's analyze both statements in more detail. First, let's consider the following aspects of the statement \\"The boys are playing football\\": 1. Number of boys involved: The statement mentions \\"boys\\" and not a specific number. It could be any number of boys playing football. 2. Activity: The boys' primary activity is playing football. 3. Inference of other activities: The statement does not provide any information about whether any of the boys are engaged in other activities, such as photography, in addition to playing football. We may assume that playing football is the main focus, but it does not exclude the possibility of other activities occurring simultaneously. Now let's look at the statement \\"Three boys are together while one is taking a picture with his camera\\": 1. Number of boys involved: This statement explicitly states that there are three boys being photographed and one boy taking the photo, totaling four boys. 2. Activity: One boy is involved in the activity of taking a photograph, while the involvement of the other three boys is not specified. It could be plausible that these three boys are posing for the photo or engaged in some other activity. 3. Inference of relationship between boys: Since one boy is photographing the other three together, we can infer that there is some form of relationship or connection between these four boys. Given the analysis above, the statement \\"The boys are playing football\\" does not necessarily imply that \\"Three boys are together while one is taking a picture with his camera.\\" The first statement does not provide enough information about the number of boys or the other potential activities they could be involved in. Additionally, we cannot establish a relationship between the boys based on the information that they are playing football alone. To conclude that the second statement is true, more context or details would be needed. For example, if we knew that the boys decided to document their football match and organized a group photo with the four of them, it would be reasonable to deduce that \\"Three boys are together while one is taking a picture with his camera.\\" However, based solely on the information provided in the initial statement, we cannot make that inference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR) in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. The contested lands were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union after the war ended in 1921, and the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1922. The western part of modern Belarus remained part of Poland.In the 1920s and 1930s, Soviet agricultural and economic policies, including collectivization and five-year plans for the national economy, led to famine and political repression. In 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Poland, marking the beginning of World War II. The Soviets invaded and annexed much of eastern Poland, which had been part of the country since the Peace of Riga two decades earlier. Much of the northern section of this area was added to the Byelorussian SSR, and now constitutes West Belarus. The Soviet-controlled Byelorussian People's Council officially took control of the territories, whose populations consisted of a mixture of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews, on 28 October 1939 in Białystok. Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. The Brest Fortress, which had been annexed in 1939, at this time was subjected to one of the most destructive onslaughts that happened during the war. Statistically, the Byelorussian SSR was the hardest-hit Soviet republic in World War II; it remained in Nazi hands until 1944. During that time, Germany destroyed 209 out of 290 cities in the republic, 85% of the republic's industry, and more than one million buildings. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion or enslavement of most or all Belarusians for the purpose of providing more living space in the East for Germans.Casualties were estimated to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during the Holocaust and never...

On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed Konzertmeister (concert master) of the Weimar Hofkapelle (court chapel) of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. The position was created for him, possibly on his demand, giving him \\"a newly defined rank order\\" according to Christoph Wolff.From 1695, an arrangement shared the responsibility for church music at the Schlosskirche (court church) between the Kapellmeister Samuel Drese and the Vize-Kapellmeister Georg Christoph Strattner, who took care of one Sunday per month while the Kapellmeister served on three Sundays. The pattern probably continued from 1704, when Strattner was succeeded by Drese's son Johann Wilhelm. When Konzertmeister Bach also assumed the principal responsibility for one cantata a month, the Kapellmeister's workload was further reduced to two Sundays per month.The performance venue on the third tier of the court church, in German called Himmelsburg (Heaven's Castle), has been described by Wolff as \\"congenial and intimate\\", calling for a small ensemble of singers and players. Performers of the cantatas were mainly the core group of the Hofkapelle, formed by seven singers, three leaders and five other instrumentalists. Additional players of the military band were available when needed, and also town musicians and singers of the gymnasium. Bach as the concertmaster probably led the performances as the first violinist, while the organ part was played by Bach's students such as Johann Martin Schubart and Johann Caspar Vogler. Even in settings like chamber music, Bach requested a strong continuo section with cello, bassoon and violone in addition to the keyboard instrument.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write an article based on this \\"Keep an open mind. Don't be hateful. Compromise. Ask her opinions about other things. Respectfully disagree.\\"","completion":"Title: Fostering Meaningful Conversations: The Art of Respectful Disagreement Introduction In a highly polarized world, maintaining an open mind and engaging in respectful disagreements have become increasingly important. Conversations can often turn sour when opposing views are met with harsh judgment and intolerance. This can hinder the exchange of ideas, create misunderstandings, and even sever valuable relationships. The key to better understanding and promoting respect in conversations involves keeping an open mind, avoiding hate, compromising, and appreciating differing opinions. By employing these tactics, we can foster more fruitful and meaningful interactions. Step 1: Keeping an Open Mind When faced with a differing perspective, it is essential to keep an open mind. By remaining receptive to new information and not letting previous biases cloud our judgment, we create an atmosphere that encourages open communication. This way, we can examine issues from various angles and ultimately, gain a broader understanding of the subject at hand. Step 2: Don't Be Hateful Disagreements can often evoke strong emotions, leading individuals to respond in hateful ways. Emotions, however, should not dictate the tone of our conversations. Avoiding personal attacks, derogatory language, and negative assumptions about others allows for more thoughtful and respectful discourse. Instead of fueling animosity, focus on countering hate with compassion and empathy, thus preserving the integrity of the conversation. Step 3: Compromise Finding common ground is critical in any discussion, especially when opposing views are involved. Recognize that concessions and compromises are not signs of weakness but rather, an essential part of productive deliberations. By demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to incorporate aspects of others' viewpoints, you build trust and encourage collaboration, ultimately leading to more fruitful discussions. Step 4: Ask for Others' Opinions Seeking others' perspectives is a valuable tool in understanding different viewpoints and fostering constructive debates. By actively asking questions, we gain a more comprehensive understanding of where others stand on an issue, their reasons for holding a particular stance, and the experiences that inform those beliefs. Engaging in curiosity-driven conversations showcases good faith, deepens insights, and establishes a sense of inclusion. Step 5: Respectfully Disagree It is crucial to recognize that disagreements are inevitable and even necessary for personal and intellectual growth. However, it is how we handle these disagreements that defines the quality of our conversations and relationships. To respectfully disagree, we must actively listen to the opposing viewpoint, acknowledge the valid points made, and express our perspective without belittling or undermining others. This respectful approach cultivates a safe space for exchanging ideas and fosters a sense of mutual understanding. Conclusion Creating meaningful conversations requires an intentional commitment to practicing open-mindedness, avoiding hate, compromising, and maintaining curiosity about other viewpoints. By incorporating these principles into our daily interactions, we promote robust and respectful exchanges that inspire growth, understanding, and ultimately, foster a more harmonious society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. - A skateboard is a type of sports equipment used primarily for the activity of skateboarding. It usually consists of a specially designed maplewood board combined with a polyurethane coating used for making smoother slides and stronger durability. Most skateboards are made with 7 plies of this wood. - Saosin is an American rock band from Orange County, California, United States. The band was formed in 2003 and recorded its first EP, \\"Translating the Name\\", that same year original vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, Cove Reber replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. The group recorded its self titled debut album which was released on Capitol Records on September 26, 2006. Their second studio album, \\"In Search of Solid Ground\\", was released on September 8, 2009 on Virgin and contains three re-recorded tracks off of \\"The Grey EP\\". Reber departed from the band in 2010 and subsequently went on a three-year hiatus. In 2013, the band reformed with all original members, except Zach, and began touring. They released their third studio album and their first studio album, \\"Along the Shadow\\", with original vocalist Anthony Green on May 20, 2016 through Epitaph Records.

Write some highlights for the following article: Michael Laudrup has emerged as favourite to replace Harry Redknapp as manager at QPR. Tim Sherwood had been considered the man to take over but those talks have stalled while QPR chairman Tony Fernandes tweeted on Tuesday to say he has found the 'dream' replacement for Redknapp, who resigned last week. 'Think I have got my dream manager. Not what anyone thinks. Take a while. Still a bit to go but I'm very happy. Press all wrong. Michael Laudrup is the favourite to succeed Harry Redknapp as QPR's manager this season. Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood was the early frontrunner for the vacant job at Loftus Road. 'Focus tonight is on the game. Support Chris and the boys. We are all in this together and want what's best for QPR. Come on you rssss.' Laudrup's odds have been slashed from 40/1 to 3/1 favourite by some bookmakers - with one major company suspending all betting on the potential outcome. The 50-year-old is currently coaching in Qatar after a two-year stint with Swansea City ended with his sacking a year ago. During his time in south Wales, Laudrup guided the Swans to their first major trophy in their history with the 2012/13 Capital One Cup trophy in his debut season at the club. Sherwood, who has been odds on since Redknapp stepped down, has drifted from 1/3 to 7/1 - the same price as the potentially outgoing Brentford manager, Mark Warburton. Laudrup has experience of managing in the Premier League following a two-year spell at Swansea City. Laudrup guided the Swans to their first major trophy in their history with the 2012/13 Capital One Cup trophy. Sherwood (right) was believed to have had talks to replace Harry Redknapp - who quit earlier this month. Redknapp will undergo double knee replacement surgery in coming weeks - and quit due to that resason. Sherwood, who worked under Redknapp during his time at Tottenham, was believed to have opened talks with QPR last week over becoming their next manager. Redknapp quit Loftus Road earlier this month, citing the fact he requires two knee operations as the reason behind his decision. Sherwood was understood to be the preferred choice of Les Ferdinand, who has been given a new role as director of football by chairman Fernandes, but it appears that the club have decided to go in a different direction with Laudrup. Ferdinand had been placed in temporary charge of the first-team along with coach Chris Ramsey but the latter oversaw their 1-0 Premier League defeat at home to Southampton on Saturday alongside Kevin Bond. The duo are also in charge of the club's midweek crunch clash away to Sunderland on Tuesday night. Ramsey took charge of QPR's 1-0 Premier League home defeat against Southampton on Saturday. Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's football chiefs refused to comment on reports linking Danish former Barcelona and Real Madrid star Laudrup to the national team's vacant coaching job. Laudrup, who won league titles as a player with some of Europe's biggest clubs, had emerged as a possible replacement for sacked Mexican Javier Aguirre. Former England coach Glenn Hoddle, who left his role as part of QPR's coaching staff following Redknapp's exit, is also believed to be in the running for the Japan job. QPR will be hoping to have a new manager in place by the time of their Premier League trip to Hull on February 21. The west London outfit currently sit 19th in the Premier League table with 19 points after 24 games, but are yet to pick up a single point away from home. QPR's Rio Ferdinand (centre) and team-mates warm-up ahead of Tuesday's match against Sunderland.","completion":"1. Michael Laudrup is now the favourite to replace Harry Redknapp as QPR manager, with former frontrunner Tim Sherwood thought to be out of the race. 2.

Some bookmakers have drastically slashed Laudrup's odds from 40/1 to 3/1, with one even suspending all betting reflecting an anticipated change in position. 4. Laudrup has had prior experience in the Premier League with a two-year stint at Swansea City, where he won the 2012/13 Capital One Cup. 5. Sherwood, initially considered the likely successor, has seen his odds drift from 1/3 to 7/1, similar to Brentford manager, Mark Warburton. 6.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Now, I have a new situation: Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home and spent most of her time indoors.

Answer this question please: Which friend was exposed to less outdoor pollution? Answer:","completion":"Patty was exposed to less outdoor pollution. This is because she spent a lot of time outdoors doing activities like running and hiking, while her friend Fay sealed up her home and spent most of her time indoors. Since both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution, being indoors would cause Fay to be exposed to more indoor air pollution, while Patty's outdoor activities would lead to her being exposed to outdoor pollution.

Given the question: Information: - Multi-purpose stadiums are a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events. While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event, this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity. It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most popular outdoor team sports football and baseball require radically different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges. - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. - Sermersooq (\\"Place of Much Ice\\") is a new municipality in Greenland, operational from 1 January 2009. It is home to Nuuk (formerly called Godthåb), the capital of Greenland, and is the most populous municipality in the country, with 21,868 inhabitants as of January 2013. The municipality consists of former municipalities of eastern and southwestern Greenland, each named after the largest settlement at the time of formation: - Nuuk is the capital and largest city of Greenland. It is the seat of government and the country's largest cultural and economic centre. The major cities closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains almost a quarter of Greenland's population, and also has the tallest building in Greenland. Nuuk is the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2016, it had a population of 17,316, making it one of the smallest capital cities in the world by population. - Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Nuuk , Greenland . It is currently used mostly for football matches . The stadium has a capacity for 2,000 . - A stadium (plural stadiums or stadia) is a place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events and consists of a field or stage either partly or completely surrounded by a tiered structure designed to allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event. - Iqaluit is the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut; its largest community, and its only city. Until 1987, the city was known as Frobisher Bay, after the large bay on the coast of which the city is situated. In 1999, Iqaluit became the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories. Before this event, Iqaluit was (relatively speaking) an insignificant city and not well-known outside of the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensively imported supplies as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road, rail, or even ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city also possesses a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island; this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, even though the city is well south of the Arctic Circle. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska.

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.

In both sentences, a court is reversing the decision of another court, specifically, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The use of \\"on Monday\\" in the first sentence and \\"today\\" in the second sentence suggests that the court's action occurred at the same time. Additionally, both sentences highlight the court that made the original decision by specifying that it was the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. To provide more context for those unfamiliar with the U.S. court system, the United States Court of Appeals is divided into 13 circuit courts, each of which has jurisdiction over a specific region. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is one of those courts, and it encompasses several western U.S. states. The court mentioned in both sentences, therefore, appears to be the same. In summary, both sentences indicate a higher court (possibly the U.S. Supreme Court or a district court) reversing a decision previously made by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

The sweet, long-haired feline was taken in by Ohio’s Richland County Humane Society in immediate need of medical attention after someone inserted a lit firecracker into the cat’s rectum, reports Mansfield News Journal. “We are currently at the vet’s office with this cat that had a firecracker set off in her rectum. We have no words. We need all your good thoughts and vibes for her. We aren’t sure if she will make it, it depends on the extent of the damage,” shelter staff posted on Facebook shortly after the innocent feline arrived under their care. Thankfully, Katy P., named by shelter workers for “Fireworks” singer Katy Perry, made it through emergency surgery at Phillips Animal Hospital. Courtesy Humane Society of Richland County It is unclear if Katy P. will be incontinent or able to defecate following the horrific incident, but veterinarians and her other caretakers are guarded but optimistic that Katy P. will survive the ordeal and be able to have a second chance at a happy life. “Her rectal catheter was removed today and there was feces on it, which is a good sign. Her urine is also clear which is another good sign. Her prognosis is better today than it was yesterday. However, she is developing an infection in her tail and received an antibiotic injection and will be on oral meds as well. She will be monitored to see if her tail needs to be amputated,” Richland County Humane Society staff shared with Katy P.’s growing number of fans in a Facebook update on Wednesday. Andrew Scherrer, a veterinarian at Phillips Animal Hospital who tended to the feline, told Mansfield News Journal that it is important that the cat is able to defecate once she if fully healed. “If she’s able to have a bowel movement, she’ll be fine,” Scherrer told the paper. While they wait to see how Katy P. heals, Richland County Humane Society staff is working to find who put this animal through such cruel abuse. The shelter’s board of directors is offering a 500 reward for information that can lead to an arrest of those involved in harming this sweet pet. Katy P. came into the shelter’s care after her original owner reached out for assistance with the cat’s painful injuries. Unable to pay for the Katy P.’s care, the owner surrendered the cat to the shelter. The shelter, not the police, is leading the investigation into who hurt Katy P., but currently has no leads. For right now, staff members are dedicated to getting justice for the feline and to giving her the best, most comfortable care possible.

Dubbed Katy P. by staffers at the Humane Society of Richland County in honor of Katy Perry's song \\"Firework,\\" the long-haired tabby underwent surgery Monday after someone put a firecracker in her rectum. \\"The most concerning thing to me is not that she's going to die,\\" said Andrew Scherrer, a veterinarian at Phillips Animal Hospital. \\"What I'm concerned about is how the rectum is going to heal.\\" If a rectal stricture — a narrowing of the passageway — develops, Katy P. would likely not survive because she would be unable to have a bowel movement. \\"If that doesn't happen, she'll make it,\\" Scherrer said. \\"If she's able to have a bowel movement, she'll be fine.\\" Even so, Scherrer said Katy P. could be incontinent, which means she could not live in inside but still could be a barn cat. The humane society received a call from the cat's owner on East Cook Road. The owner didn't have the money for veterinary care and surrendered Katy P. to the shelter. Katy P. was in dire condition, humane agent Missy Houghton said. \\"We couldn't look at her very closely because she was in so much pain,\\" Houghton said, adding there was a lot of exposed flesh. Estimated to be 2 to 4 years old, the friendly cat with black stripes and yellow eyes, whom Scherrer calls a \\"sweetheart,\\" likely allowed the person to put the firecracker in her rectum. \\"That makes it even more infuriating,\\" Houghton said. \\"The more you think about it, the angrier you get. \\"We just try not to dwell on it. It's disgusting.\\" So far, Houghton said there are no leads as to who injured the cat. The humane society, not police, is handling the investigation. As a reporter and photographer stopped by to see Katy P., she was sporting an Elizabethan collar around her neck and was under the influence of a lot of pain medication. \\"She's been kept very comfortable,\\" Scherrer said. \\"She's just recovered really well.\\" The vet added Katy P. has not shown much interest in food or water, but that is likely because of the medication. Katy P. also is not a fan of her collar. \\"She has gotten out of it several times,\\" Scherrer said. Donations for the cat's care have been pouring in. As of noon Tuesday, the humane society has received about 1,200, with Phillips Animal Hospital getting another 200. Houghton does not know how much treatment will cost.

That is the question from the White House in Washington to the Blue House in Seoul — and perhaps also inside the Ryongsong Residence in Pyongyang.

Moments after the summit between Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un concluded, VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren and I spent a few minutes with the U.S. president and his secretary of state, at the Capella.

There are several causes leading to poor eyesight like not enough food, gene and aging . Televisions, computers and reading are also the causes of having poor eyesight. If you happen to work in front of the computer, it is best to take a rest every once in a while. Something dirty can cause redness and they will make you feel uncomfortable. It is bad for your eyes, too. If this happens, the best way is to clean your eyes by using cold water. You must also try your best to protect your eyes from harmful thing. For example, sunglasses are not just fashion but they can also serve as a great way to protect your eyesight from _ . Eating healthy foods will do good to your eyesight. Remember that vitamins A, C and E are good for eyes. Try to eat food groups that have these vitamins. And you should do eye exercises because exercise protects your eyesight, too. If a person exercises regularly and eats the right kind of food, his eyes will stay in good condition for a long time. All above are natural ways of eye care that help us keep healthy eyes.

A:","completion":"If you have to work in front of the computer, the best option to maintain healthy eyesight is D) Have a rest after working for a while. Taking regular breaks from staring at the computer screen can help reduce eye strain and prevent potential issues with your vision.

While options A, B, and C are also essential in maintaining eye health, they directly relate to specific situations: A) Eating healthy foods - While consuming a balanced diet rich in vitamins A, C, and E can help maintain good eye health, it doesn't specifically address the strain caused by working in front of a computer. B) Cleaning your eyes by using cold water - This is a great way to refresh and soothe your eyes when they feel uncomfortable or irritated due to dirt or other irritants, but it isn't a direct solution to the issue of staring at the computer screen for extended periods. However, it can still be helpful to rinse your eyes after a day of work to remove any accumulated dirt or debris. C) Wearing a pair of sunglasses - Sunglasses protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, glare, and bright lights when outdoors.

The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg. I am facing a new situation today: Johnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on. He doesn't have a balance, so he makes a crude one out of materials he has on hand. He put a block of wood on either side and the block on the left side was at a lower level than the block on the right.

Click to read one columnist's view that Romney has changed his story over the years. Article:","completion":"Title: Romney Debunks Misconceptions on Bain Tenure, Demands Apology from Obama Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate, has forcefully addressed criticisms concerning his tenure at Bain Capital. He has asked for an official apology from President Obama for what he has described as \\"disgusting\\" attacks from his advisers. Romney gave an array of television interviews aiming to clarify his relationship with Bain Capital and insisted he ceased all management activities in the company by February 1999. \\"There's nothing wrong with being associated with Bain Capital, of course,\\" Romney said during his interview with CNN. He emphasized that his primary role ended in early 1999, debunking rumors that he maintained a hand in pressing business dealings after that period. In spite of his declaration, questions arose concerning his continued association with the company. Documents open to public perusal revealed that Romney still held key positions at Bain Capital even after his announced exit. Addressing these concerns on CBS, Romney stated, \\"I still retained an ownership interest.\\" He clarified that he possess the right to oversee the firm if he had chosen not to take leave, but indicated he elected other pursuits instead. Romney made a discernible distinction between holding an ownership stake and being actively involved in business operations: “There is a difference between being a shareholder, an owner if you will, than a person who is running an entity.” The controversy soon escalated when an Obama adviser insinuated that Romney could be guilty of a felony due to his connections with Bain Capital. In response to this indictment during an interview on ABC, Romney informed, \\"This is simply beneath the dignity of the presidency of the United States.\\" He condemned these comments as striking below the belt of presidential decorum and insisted that Obama take responsibility for the claims made by his team. Romney further expanded on this during an interview with Fox News. \\"He really needs to rein in his team and to finally take responsibility for what they're saying,\\" he commented. The presidential candidate went on to question the ethical basis of the Obama campaign, \\"What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?” When asked if an apology from Obama was in order, Romney responded with a resounding, \\"Absolutely—my goodness!\\" Despite Romney's clearly stated defenses, some are still skeptical. Politico and AP have summaries that dig into the details of the situation. Meanwhile, a columnist has opined that Romney's narrative has shifted over the years. Regardless of these lingering doubts and the ongoing controversy, it is evident that Romney remains resolute on his stance: He did not have any active management role at Bain Capital post-Feb 1999, and he expects an apology from President Barack Obama for the false allegations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who was confronted with a language barrier? Hirata is a successful Japanese businessman whose plan for a two-week winter holiday in Hawaii to play golf changes when his elderly grandfather reminds him that he should go to Iceland. Hirata's parents died there seven years ago, and the seven year death anniversary is a significant event in Japanese culture. Hirata must perform a ceremony in the river where they died after drowning in an avalanche – the drowned must be fed by the surviving family members if they are to find peace. Hirata goes to Iceland – to Reykjavík. His final destination is a remote river on the far side of the island. He encounters one mishap and misadventure after another. He first accidentally gets on a wrong bus filled with German tourists traveling to see the hot springs. He also confronts a language barrier; Hirata cannot speak any Icelandic, and knows very little English. After his first day's misadventures, Hirata decides to purchase an ancient, bright red Citroën DS to make the journey. During the long drive, Hirata meets several strange people along the way. These include the mystical woman who sells him the car, that only plays one radio station. Next, Hirata meets a local woman who collects photographs of funerals. The following day, Hirata meets two American hitchhiker/fugitives (Lili Taylor and Fisher Stevens), who turn out to be armed and dangerous who proceed to steal his car. Nearing his destination on foot, Hirata arrives in a small village where he meets an old man named Siggi, the owner of a local lodge who teaches Hirata how to drink the most potent alcoholic beverage in Iceland.

Ecuador went out of the World Cup with a display of heroic defiance which shook France, the new contenders for the crown, to their aristocratic roots. The unfancied South Americans blazed another thrilling episode into this magnificent World Cup even after Manchester United’s Antonio Valencia was sent off early in the second half. That decision by the Ivory Coast referee could not discourage Ecuador from going desperately close to overcoming a French team who have become many people’s latest fancy to return here to the Maracana for the final. A lot of hearts went out with Ecuador as their electric counter-attacks had Didier Deschamps’ men scrambling to keep them out. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was almost as busy in the French goal as the flying Alexander Dominguez at the other end. What had begun as a rather tame affair finished with an explosion of chances in both goalmouths. Goalless it finished. A bore it was not. As close as they came: Antoine Griezmann hits the bar as Ecuador scramble to clear their lines.

When the breathless end came, France were heading for a date with Nigeria, Ecuador for home. However, the concept of this French team as ready to surpass the likes of Brazil and Argentina was not given any added traction.Beneath all the thrills there a was a back story on which the French are building their aspirations. The. battle for Karim Benzema was being joined in earnest by Real Madrid and. Arsenal, even as France breathlessly awaited a further sign that this. man is riding a magic carpet similar to that on which Zinedine Zidane. bore them to World Cup glory. The French regard Le Mistral, the hot. southern wind which comes to them from the deserts of North Africa, as. being full of mystery and wonder.That superstition was heightened. when Zidane, born in Marseilles of Algerian parents, arose to spirit. them to their first world championship in Paris in 1998. Sixteen. years later Benzema, born in Lyon to parents from a deeply spiritual. corner of Algeria, is emerging as their exotic new talisman. To. support that belief, he went into this match against Ecuador’s hopefuls. only one behind the four-goal leaders in the race for the Golden Boot,. Neymar and Lionel Messi. Not that he looked like catching them on this. outing. Still the French see it as another positive omen that on the. very day they formally closed out qualification for the last 16 Zidane. has accepted his first managerial appointment, at the club which is. determined to keep Benzema. Less romantically, the recruitment of Benzema’s idol as coach of their second team is a piece of clever opportunism by Real. The. prospect of working in the same environment as Zidane, on a daily. basis, would make it all the more of a wrench for Benzema to up sticks. and move to north London. A persuasion perhaps as great as the hugely. enriching new contract with which Real are preparing to welcome him back. to Spain from this World Cup. It counters the attraction to Benzema of playing under Arsene Wenger, the iconic French manager at the Emirates. VIDEO France fans optimistic about knockout stage. Just wide: Paul Pogba went close with this late header. Flying lesson: Alex Ibarra takes a trip under pressure from Lucas Digne. Hands on: Karim Benzema gets to grips with Frickson Erazo. Holding on: Alexander Dominguez of Ecuador makes a save as France threaten to break the deadlock. Girls' night out: The significant others of Yohan Cabaye, Loic Remy, Mamadou Sakho, Bacary Sagna and Patrice Evra enjoy a night out at the Maracana. Arsenal. are hoping also that one of their moles in the French camp, Olivier. Giroud, can excite Benzema to the possibility of them partnering each. other in the Premier League the way they work together for France. Albeit. not from the off in this game, in which Benzema was nudged forward. positionally to orthodox centre-forward and Giroud rested. But these. players will not be able to resist comparing two contracts, Giroud’s. existing deal at Arsenal and the bonanza being offered for Benzema to. keep playing his club football in Spain. And it has to be doubtful if. Arsenal will be either willing or able to match such astronomic wages,. especially if Benzema pushes them yet higher with more goals in these. finals. Such has Benzema’s impact been on this shimmering tournament. already that the French have as good as forgotten the grief which. consumed their nation when Franck Ribery was taken from them by injury. Ribery, after all, had been described by Zidane as ‘the new jewel of French football’. But. this team came into this tournament sparkling without him, so. brilliantly in their first two games that they have begun daring to. dream of winning their second World Cup. Ecuador have brought a. little perspective to that notion. They entered the Maracana expecting. that if they were to join Les Bleus they would have to resist being. demolished the way the Swiss were by France in game two of this group. Switzerland,. despite that five-goal hammering, were in pole position to follow. France through as they took on a demoralised Honduras. Ecuador. gleaned hope that they might match the Swiss result from the practice. of Deschamps rotating his players from match to match. High riser: Karim Benzema shrugs off the attentions of Juan Carlos Paredes to go close in the first half. High boot: Bacary Sagna gets some studs on his torso during the Maracana encounter. Hard in: Blaise Matuidi skips a tackle from Christian Noboa. Touching distance: Lucas Digne manages to escape the attentions of Antonio Valencia. Holding on: Hugo Lloris collects a loose ball to deny Ecuador a goalscoring chance. Patrice Evra. also took a turn on the bench, while Southampton’s contribution to this. World Cup was expanded by Morgan Schneiderlein being given a first World. Cup game here in place of Yohan Cabaye in midfield. A pity club-mates Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw were not still here to see it. Scheniderlin announced his arrival on this lofty stage with a feisty tussle with Antonio Valencia. Of. the Premier League contingent on view, Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko. threatened in the early exchanges and Lloris came out smartly to smother. at the feet of Ecuador’s other Valencia. He was to be even busier. later. And while Antonio was not playing badly, Enner Valencia. continued to stretch the French defence, notably with a close-range. header which Lloris again did well to keep out. Clearing his lines: Laurent Koscielny removes the danger as Enner Valencia advances. Aerial battle: Ecuador's Jorge Guagua heads the ball to his teammates as France's Antoine Griezmann defends. A cause for concern: Enner Valencia left the field after suffering an injury in the first half. Marked man: Segundo Castillo keeps a close eye on dangerman Karim Benzema.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: what was the last state to be added to the united states??","completion":"The last state to be added to the United States was Hawaii, which officially became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Situated in the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii is an archipelago of eight major islands along with several smaller islands and atolls. The major islands are Hawai'i (also known as the Big Island), Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau, and Kahoolawe. Hawaii's path to statehood was a long and complex one. Before the arrival of Europeans, Hawaii was an independent Polynesian kingdom with a rich history and culture. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, European explorers and traders, led by British Captain James Cook, visited the islands and established contact with the native Hawaiians. Their arrival brought diseases that the native Hawaiian population had no immunity to, ultimately leading to a significant decline in their numbers. Throughout the 19th century, Hawaii experienced a period of rapid economic and societal transformation, with American missionaries and immigrant laborers, particularly from Asia, arriving in large numbers. The influence of these newcomers began to permeate Hawaiian society, impacting everything from politics and economics to religion and education. In 1893, the last reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Queen Liliʻuokalani, was overthrown by a group of American and European businessmen in a coup. A provisional government was established, which was later replaced by the Republic of Hawaii in 1894. The United States annexed the islands during the Spanish-American War in 1898, and Hawaii became a US territory in 1900. As a US territory, Hawaii developed a thriving economy based on agriculture (particularly pineapple and sugarcane), tourism, and military installations. However, the territory's population was diverse, and not all residents were in favor of statehood. Many native Hawaiian groups, as well as some immigrant laborers, felt that the United States had illegitimately taken control of their islands. Despite these concerns, calls for statehood grew louder after World War II, which had seen a massive influx of military personnel and investment into the region. Hawaii's strategic location in the Pacific Ocean made it essential for US defense interests, and this, combined with the islands' burgeoning tourism industry, prompted Congress to consider admitting Hawaii as a state. Following several years of debate and deliberation, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Hawaii Admission Act into law on March 18, 1959. This act provided for Hawaii's transition from a territory to a state, pending the approval of the people of Hawaii. A plebiscite was held in June 1959, in which over 94% of the voters supported statehood, and Hawaii officially joined the union as the 50th state on August 21, 1959. Hawaii's unique history, rich cultural heritage, and natural beauty have made it a distinctive and valuable addition to the United States. Today, the state plays a vital role in US defense, as well as being a major tourism destination, and it continues to be a melting pot of diverse cultures and traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these two questions, let's break down each question step-by-step and discuss the possible solutions. Question 1: How do I call a person who has blocked my number? Step 1: Determine the reason for the block Consider whether it is appropriate to continue contacting the person if they have blocked your number. There may be a reason for the block, and respecting their wishes could be important. Step 2: Use an alternative method If you still need to contact the person, consider using an alternative communication method, such as email or social media, to convey your message. Step 3: Use a different phone If the other methods are not viable, you might try using a different phone to call the person. Caller ID might show a different number, and it may not be blocked. Question 2: How can I call a blocked number on my cell phone? Step 1: Assess the reason for the blocked number Determine if the number was blocked intentionally or accidentally. If the number was blocked for a legitimate reason, consider respecting the person's privacy. Step 2: Unblock the number If you still need to call the blocked number, you can unblock it by accessing your phone's call settings or contacting your service provider for assistance. Step 3: Call the number After unblocking the number, you can proceed to call it as you would with any other contact. Now, let's compare the answers to these questions to determine if they are the same: [i] No [ii] Yes Answer: [i] No. The answers to these two questions are not the same because the first question deals with calling someone who has blocked your number, while the second question deals with calling a number that you have blocked on your phone.

I have a new situation: Two plants of the same type are growing near the outskirts of the Jorah forest. The first plant, colored red, is healthy and has no fungus on it. The other plant, colored black, has a fungus growing on the roots of it. These plants have been around for centuries and if crushed into a powder actually make a nice seasoning to add to a meal. But I can use this background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. What is an answer for this question: Which color plant is sharing access to its glucose?","completion":"Based on the provided information, the black colored plant, which has a fungus growing on its roots, is likely sharing access to its glucose with the fungus through a mycorrhizal association. This symbiotic relationship benefits both the plant and the fungus, as the plant gets improved water and nutrient absorption thanks to the fungi's mycelia, while the fungus gains access to glucose produced by the plant through photosynthesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: How much of anybody swear to be brothers ? Title: The Warlords Movie plot: The film is set in China in the 1860s, during the Taiping Rebellion. It is based on the assassination of Ma Xinyi in 1870. In the beginning, there is a battle between loyalists and rebels, during which all of the loyalists are killed except Qingyun, the general. Qingyun goes to a village nearby where the inhabitants engage in banditry, being led by two men, Erhu and Wuyang. He offers his assistance in executing a raid against a rebel convoy. However, a loyalist army assaults the village shortly afterward and seizes the spoils for themselves. Around this time, Qingyun begins an affair with Erhu's wife. Since the villagers are poor and starving, Qingyun convinces them to fight the rebels as an independent loyalist war-band. Erhu and Wuyang are distrustful of Qingyun, so the three of them perform a blood ceremony where, under the pain of death, they promise to care for each other like brothers. The war-band wins a series of victories. Qingyun becomes ambitious and prepares to attack Suzhou and Nanjing. However, the government becomes fearful of Qingyun's growing influence, and decides to deny reinforcements and provisions. As a result, the attack on Suzhou becomes a year-long siege. Erhu attempts to kill the enemy commander by sneaking into the city in disguise. He is quickly captured, but to his surprise, the enemy commander was already planning on surrendering, and allows Erhu to kill him in exchange for sparing his troops from execution. However, Qingyun refuses to honor the deal and has the prisoners massacred. Erhu considers desertion, but Qingyun convinces him that the attack on Nanjing will liberate millions of innocent lives. Nanjing is easily taken, and Qingyun, in return for his grand success, is awarded the position of Nanjing's governor. As Qingyun waits for his inauguration, he tries to make friends with other upper-class people. Erhu, however, has been jaded by the war, and does improper things such as handing out bonus pay without permission. Qingyun responds by arranging for Erhu's murder,...

Watching bloopers, also known as outtakes or mistaakes made during film production, can be a lot of fun. They provide a different, often humorous, look at the characters, actors, and production of the content that you find enjoyable and entertaining. Bloopers lighten the mood and allow fans to see that the actors and production crew are human, and that everyone makes mistakes. It also often showcases the camaraderie and rapport that the actors have with one another when they can laugh off a mistake together. In addition to providing entertainment, bloopers can offer several benefits to those who watch them. These are some of the reasons why people enjoy watching bloopers: 1. Entertainment Value: Bloopers are amusing because they show actors in a more relaxed, off-guard state compared to their polished, on-screen personas. Additionally, the humor and laughter that often accompany bloopers make for enjoyable, lighthearted viewing. 2. Relatability: Watching bloopers can be comforting at times because it reminds us that even professional actors, who we admire and look up to, make mistakes. This relatability can help fans feel more connected to the actors and the production, knowing that they too are human. 3. Behind-the-Scenes Insight: Bloopers offer a glimpse into the production process and show how challenging and dynamic film and television production can be. This insider perspective can give fans a greater appreciation for the efforts that go into creating their favorite content. 4. Encouraging Creativity: Sometimes, bloopers can lead to new ideas and creative solutions that might not have been considered otherwise. While the original goal is to stick to the script, a spontaneous moment or mistake may inspire an ingenious ad-lib or a funnier take on a scene. Bloopers can also open our eyes to the value of improvisation, as it often results in more authentic and memorable moments. 5. Building a Connection with Fans: Bloopers can create a sense of community among fans, giving them something to bond over, and allowing them to share their enjoyment of the content in a different way. This connection can create lasting memories and spark conversations, providing fans with a familiar subject to discuss with one another. In summary, it does follow that you also enjoy watching bloopers, given their entertainment value and the connection they help foster between you and the content you love. These outtakes provide a unique, lighthearted perspective on the creative process and help to remind viewers of the human aspect in film and television production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: The Bears hosted the 6-5 Seattle Seahawks in Week 13, who had lost five of their first six road games. The Bears started the game strong, with Brian Urlacher forcing Marshawn Lynch to fumble, and the ball was recovered by Kelvin Hayden, and Jay Cutler eventually hit Earl Bennett on a 12-yard touchdown pass. The Bears would later fail twice to expand their lead; first, Lovie Smith called for Michael Bush to run up the middle on fourth-and-one at the Seattle 15, and he was stopped for no gain. On the second occasion, Bennett dropped a potential 62-yard touchdown pass. The Seahawks capitalized on the two blunders, with rookie quarterback Russell Wilson hitting Golden Tate on a 49-yard pass, and eventually scored on Lynch's 4-yard touchdown run. Wilson would complete 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries. Seattle then took the lead on Steven Hauschka's 31-yard field goal to close the half. Seattle would have scored a touchdown on the previous play, but Braylon Edwards dropped the potential 10-yard touchdown pass in the end zone. In the third quarter, Chicago regained the lead on Cutler's 12-yard touchdown pass to Matt Forte, but Wilson would lead the Seahawks 97 yards to take back the lead on a touchdown pass to Tate. Cutler would then hit Brandon Marshall on a 56-yard pass to set up Robbie Gould's game-tying 46-yard field goal. In overtime, the Seahawks won the toss, and Wilson took the offense 80 yards, and threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Sidney Rice. On the play, Major Wright hit Rice while he was catching the ball, appearing to knock Rice unconscious and the ball out of his hands, but the review upheld the touchdown, giving Seattle the victory. The loss dropped Chicago down to 8-4, once again tying them with the Packers for the NFC North lead. The 459 yards allowed are the most by the team all season. This would mark Urlacher's final game in a Bears' uniform. Urlacher was inactive for the final four games of the 2012 season, and he retired from the NFL on May 22, 2013.","completion":"How did Russell Wilson's performance, including completing 23 of 37 passes for 293 yards with two touchdowns and a 104.9 passer rating while rushing for 71 yards on nine carries, contribute to the Seattle Seahawks' victory over the Bears in Week 13, despite the Bears' strong start to the game and Brian Urlacher's forced fumble on Marshawn Lynch?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's the moment every pet owner dreads - when the time comes when they have to say a final goodbye to a faithful friend. These heart-breaking end-of-life snaps are meant to highlight the special relationship between an owner and their dying pet in its last moments. Sarah Ernhart, the owner of Sarah Beth Photography in Minneapolis, created them in what she dubbed a 'Joy Session', in which she records owners' last embrace with their pets that are too old to live or have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses. Final embrace: These special, end-of-life photography sessions are just for terminally ill or elderly pets. Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, trademarked the name Joy Session, and began offering them in 2010. She has since had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets. 'People seem to love the idea,' she said. 'It's getting bigger and bigger.' The service has become so popular that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners. 'It can definitely be very emotional,' Mrs Ernhart said. 'It's a very sensitive time for these people who have been with these animals for their entire lives. I definitely have cried with some of the owners. 'The sessions can be happy at the same time because the owners get to talk about their favorite little quirks and things that they like about their pets. I get this inside view of what these people's lives are like. It's a pretty powerful.' Explaining how she came up with the idea, Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name \\"Joy Session\\" is not something I arbitrarily chose. There's a. very personal meaning behind it, and I'd like to share how it all began. Mrs Ernhart said: 'The name \\"Joy Session\\" is not something I arbitrarily chose. There's a. very personal meaning behind it' The images were created by photographer Sarah Ernhart, the owner of Sarah Beth Photography in Minneapolis. Last moments: The beautiful, yet heartbreaking pictures, are meant to highlight the relationship between pet and owner before they pass. 'Shortly. before Christmas in 2009, I had a photo shoot with a woman named Joan. Her friend booked the session as a gift, and we had a beautiful sunny. day for it. 'Joan was living. at home in Hospice care, and relied on the companionship and day-to-day. help of her Service Dog, a Black Lab named Joy. Joy was her rock, her. best friend, and had saved Joan's life on more than one occasion. 'She would let Joan know when her blood sugar was low, and if she was about to have a seizure. Joy would place herself under Joan to break her fall, stand firm to help. her up, and was by her side day and night. I came into this session. knowing that Joan didn't have much time left, but I had no idea I'd be meeting such a vibrant, funny, happy woman. Mrs Ernhart, who has been a professional photographer since 2006, began offering her service in 2010. The service has become widespread enough that Mrs Ernhart has built a directory of photographers around the world who shoot terminally ill pets with their owners. 'She. was so blessed to have Joy come into her life, and her eyes lit up with. every story she told of her. She said that Joy was her \\"gift from God\\" and taking these photos had given her something wonderful to look. forward to. 'Their bond was. palpable, and it was easy to see that both of them were very loved. Her. apartment was filled with the word \\"Joy\\" in artwork and pillows and. Christmas decorations. 'She even wore a \\"Joy\\" sweatshirt during our session.We sat and chatted for a long time. Joan's zest for life, even with her declining health, was a breath of. fresh air for me, and helped me see that what I do is meaningful and. important in so many ways. Emotional: The photographer said the sessions are for people who want to 'celebrate the happiness' their pets have brought to their lives. Final farewell: Two boys pictured saying their final goodbye to their pet dog. Last rites: An owner strokes his pet in the park before the terminally ill dog dies. 'Without. knowing it at the time, she and Joy sparked the idea to offer photo. sessions specifically for pets that are nearing the end of their lives. 'For so many people, their pets mean the world to them, and I want to. provide an opportunity to capture what makes them so special, especially. in such a difficult time. 'My. first \\"official\\" Joy session was with a Bernese Mountain dog named. Griffin, in January of 2010. I really didn't know what to call this. service, and \\"Emergency Session\\" was the first thing I could think of. It sounded so cold and impersonal, and I struggled with what I should. really call it. Difficult time: For many people, their pets mean the world to them, said Mrs Ernhart. The snapper says she had more than 100 shoots with owners and their pets since she launched the service three years ago. Last embrace: A woman with her beloved pet dog in its last moments. Goodbye old friend: A faithful pet dog shortly before it is put down. Time to say goodbye: A dog pictured looking on. Little does it know there is only a short while left. Difficult time: For many people, their pets mean the world to them, said Mrs Ernhart.

I couldn't think of. anything or anyone I'd met who embodied such love and such a deep. connection as Joan and Joy.

Let's discuss each of the other choices to provide a better understanding of why \\"trouble\\" is the best answer: - Dog's mouth: Cats ripping things apart doesn't necessarily relate to a dog's mouth. While a dog might try to grab the ripped object, this is not directly connected to the cat's destructive behavior. - Floor: While the floor might be littered with the cat's ripped-up materials, it's only the location where the destruction takes place, not the actual cause or issue at hand. - Garage: This choice is specific to a location rather than describing the problem itself. Cats can rip things apart anywhere, not just in garages. - Nature: Although cats are natural hunters and might engage in ripping behavior in nature, the act of ripping things apart in a domestic setting is unrelated to nature itself and instead indicates destructive and problematic behavior. In conclusion, the choice that best represents the essence of the issue when cats are ripping things apart is \\"trouble,\\" as this captures the potential problems created by their destructive actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. and a hint : Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Please answer this question : Which person studied less about Energy in ATP ? Answer:","completion":"Ben studied less about Energy in ATP. Step-by-step justification: 1. Ben studied magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are minerals and play specific roles in various biochemical processes, but they aren't directly related to the process of energy in ATP mentioned in the hint. 2. Andy, on the other hand, studied sodium and potassium, which are involved in the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump is an essential process for maintaining cellular ion balance and function, and it consumes energy derived from ATP to function. 3. Since the hint specifically talks about energy in ATP in relation to the sodium-potassium pump, we can deduce that Andy's studies included more information about energy in ATP. In conclusion, Ben studied less about Energy in ATP as compared to Andy, whose studies directly involved energy consumption in the form of ATP."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"The data provided indicates that Elliot See, an individual presumed to be prominent or significant, died in a place called St. Louis. Moreover, the data suggests that St. Louis was, at the time of the record, a part of the Kingdom of France. Below is a detailed description of this information. 1. Elliot See: While the data does not offer extensive information on Elliot See, it is possible that they may have been an important or influential person given their inclusion in this material. Elliot See could have been a historical figure, a government official, an explorer, or a scientist. Without more context, it is hard to establish a comprehensive outline of their life, background, and contributions. However, their death location serves as a clue, shedding some light on their origin or connection to St. Louis. 2. Death Place: St. Louis St. Louis, the location of Elliot See's demise, is a city situated along the western bank of the Mississippi River. It is currently in the state of Missouri, United States. Known for its historical significance in the westward expansion of the United States, it played an influential role in American history. St. Louis has also been a vital port city, located strategically on the Mississippi River, which facilitated economic growth, commerce, and transportation in the region. 3. St. Louis as part of the Kingdom of France: The data mentions that St. Louis was once part of the Kingdom of France, an information pointing toward the city's history during the European colonization of North America. Founded in 1764 by French fur traders, Pierre Laclède and Auguste Chouteau, St. Louis was initially a French settlement. In 1762, as part of the Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded the Louisiana territory, including St. Louis, to Spain. However, the city was regained by France under Napoleon in 1800 before ultimately being sold to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Thus, St. Louis' connection to the Kingdom of France helps reveal its rich colonial history and significance in the territorial expansions of the North American continent. In conclusion, this data offers limited yet relevant information regarding Elliot See, an individual with an unspecified background whose death occurred in St. Louis. Furthermore, it highlights the historical connection between St. Louis and the Kingdom of France, emphasizing the city's importance as a significant colonial settlement and participant in the regional power dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
