According to Patricia, the incident had left them feeling vulnerable and anxious, gravely impacting their mental health and well-being. In response to Patricia's statement, the media coverage quickly gained momentum. Articles and news broadcasts began to share the story, seeking to provide information to the public about the alleged assault. With the growing interest in this case, scrutiny fell on both Patricia and Amy, with their actions and statements being scrutinized by journalists and the public alike. Option 1: Patricia receives a lot of sympathy from the media As Patricia shared their experiences with the world, many within the media expressed their sympathy and understanding. News reports and articles discussed Patricia's pain and the impact on their life, calling for justice to be served. Social media, too, became a platform for Patricia's supporters to rally behind them, using hashtags and creating online campaigns to show solidarity and demand accountability from Amy. Opinion pieces explored the issues of violence and assault, and the role of power dynamics in these situations, with many journalists taking Patricia's side. The public's empathy grew as Patricia's story resonated with the experiences of many people who had faced similar hardships. The emotional response from the media further amplified Patricia's voice, transforming them into a symbol of strength and resilience. Option 2: Amy receives a lot of sympathy from the media However, not everyone was quick to believe Patricia's claims. Many within the media started questioning the validity of the accusations, demanding evidence to substantiate the allegations. As the case unfolded, sympathies began to shift towards Amy, with journalists and commentators suggesting that they may be innocent, and that Patricia's public statement could be a means to tarnish Amy's reputation. Amy, feeling wrongfully accused, decided to share their side of the story, asserting that the events described by Patricia had never occurred. This, too, became a widely-discussed topic across media outlets, sparking debates about the pitfalls of trial by public opinion. Instances of false accusations and their consequences on the accused's lives were explored in-depth in various analyses, urging the public to remain cautious in making judgments. The intense media scrutiny took its toll on both Amy and Patricia, as both parties found their lives under constant examination. However, despite the shifting sympathies of the media, it became clear that in a case like this, the undeniable fact remains that the testimonies of both parties need thorough and impartial investigation before a fair conclusion can be reached. As the focus on this case continued to grow, it served as a stark reminder of the importance of exercising caution in the court of public opinion and the need for proper legal channels when dealing with sensitive matters like assault allegations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Veteran Luke Ridnour Rapidly Adds Four Teams to His Résumé Everything about Luke Ridnour’s N.B.A. career was fairly nondescript until a week ago. Over 12 seasons, he was gainfully employed by five organizations, averaging 9.3 points and 4.5 assists as he played for the likes of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Minnesota Timberwolves. A steady-handed point guard, he was also capable of shooting well from beyond the 3-point line. He was a player who rounded out rosters, a backup vocalist to more famous stars. Nothing about his game screamed for attention. But on the eve of the N.B.A.’s free-agent period, Ridnour has become someone else altogether, through no fault of his own — the league’s foremost vagabond. As of last Wednesday, Ridnour was still a member of the Orlando Magic, for whom he played last season. Since then, he has become a member of four other teams. The Magic sent him to the Memphis Grizzlies, who traded him to the Charlotte Hornets, who dealt him to the Oklahoma City Thunder, who sent him to the Toronto Raptors. The last move was made Tuesday; the Thunder received the draft rights to Tomislav Zubcic, a Croatian power forward who has yet to appear in an N.B.A. game. And the Raptors may not even keep Ridnour. Ridnour, 34, has become so eminently dispensable (and acquirable) because he has a 2.75 million contract that is nonguaranteed. Salaries generally need to align whenever teams make trades. So Ridnour’s contract is a useful one to include as teams seek ways to engineer deals and clear space under the salary cap. Teams try to include nonguaranteed years on these types of contracts for this purpose, and Ridnour probably knew he would be dealt in the run-up to free agency, which is set to begin shortly after midnight. But four times? And counting? The good news for him is that the start of free agency will initiate a league-imposed moratorium on further deals until July 9. So it has been a pseudo-odyssey for Ridnour, who has been involved in deals for Zubcic, Janis Timma, Matt Barnes and Jeremy Lamb. But only Ridnour’s contract has been shipped from organization to organization; Ridnour himself has not gone anywhere. Several former players, including Quentin Richardson, can no doubt relate. Over a four-week span in 2009, Richardson went from the Knicks to the Grizzlies to the Los Angeles Clippers to the Timberwolves. But Ridnour has hopscotched to different teams at a pace that is truly dizzying. Predictably, the Internet has had some fun with Ridnour’s travels. His Wikipedia page was temporarily blocked because of “persistent vandalism.” Someone had amended his profile to include the comment that Ridnour had “been traded four times in the past week and doesn’t have a clue where he lives.” A version of this article appears in print on July 1, 2015, on page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Veteran Rapidly Adds Four Teams to His Résumé.

Answer a question about this article: During the 18th and 19th centuries, federal law traditionally focused on areas where there was an express grant of power to the federal government in the federal Constitution, like the military, money, foreign relations (especially international treaties), tariffs, intellectual property (specifically patents and copyrights), and mail. Since the start of the 20th century, broad interpretations of the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution have enabled federal law to expand into areas like aviation, telecommunications, railroads, pharmaceuticals, antitrust, and trademarks. In some areas, like aviation and railroads, the federal government has developed a comprehensive scheme that preempts virtually all state law, while in others, like family law, a relatively small number of federal statutes (generally covering interstate and international situations) interacts with a much larger body of state law. In areas like antitrust, trademark, and employment law, there are powerful laws at both the federal and state levels that coexist with each other. In a handful of areas like insurance, Congress has enacted laws expressly refusing to regulate them as long as the states have laws regulating them (see, e.g., the McCarran-Ferguson Act). When did the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution allow federal power to begin expanding?","completion":"The Commerce and Spending Clauses of the Constitution allowed federal power to begin expanding in the 20th century.

The customer is mentioning that the product broke after just 30 minutes of use. They also mention that this is their first experience with maple sticks, and their son usually uses hickory sticks. The customer acknowledges that maple might not be as durable as hickory but still expresses concern about the short life of the product. Step 2: Consider the possible reasons for the issue. The customer suggests two possible reasons for the issue: the stick might have had a grain that was not quite straight, making it weak, or the low price might be an indication of a general issue with the product. Step 3: Evaluate the relevance of the review. As a potential buyer, I would evaluate whether the mentioned drawbacks are relevant to me. If I am also planning to buy maple sticks for the first time, this review might be particularly relevant, as it highlights a potential issue with the product's durability. Step 4: Weigh the pros and cons. In this case, the review highlights a significant issue with the product, breaking after just 30 minutes of use. Additionally, the customer highlights that this issue might be a common one due to the low sale price. Conclusion: Based on the steps above, I conclude that the mentioned review would decrease the chances of buying the product.

These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence as they provide different pieces of information about the Windermere Steamboat Museum and relate to different aspects of its existence. The first sentence establishes the location of the Windermere Steamboat Museum, which is north of the town, and provides a brief insight into its purpose: showcasing the golden age of lake transport. This suggests that the museum is open and functioning. In contrast, the second sentence discusses a different aspect of the museum's history by mentioning that it had stood empty for many years. This statement does not inherently contradict the information provided in the first sentence, but it introduces a new piece of information which is not contained in the first sentence. The second sentence relates to the museum's past, whereas the first sentence seems to describe its current state and its purpose.

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: Who says he won't tell the Bishop that anything is amiss? Title: The Keys of the Kingdom Movie plot: Father Francis Chisholm (Gregory Peck) is visited in his old age by Monsignor Sleeth (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) at his parish in Tweedside. The Monsignor informs Father Francis that the Bishop thinks it would be better if he retires, as Father Francis' somewhat unorthodox recent teachings have become a distraction. The Monsignor retires to his room in the rectory, and finds Father Francis' diary that recounts his story from 1878. As the Monsignor begins to read the diary, a flashback begins. One night during his childhood, Francis' father was beaten by an anti-Catholic mob during a rainstorm. As his mother attempts to lead her husband to safety, they both die in a bridge collapse, leaving young Francis an orphan. He is raised by his aunt, and the next we see of Francis, he is leaving for the seminary with his childhood friend, Anselm \\"Angus\\" Mealey (Vincent Price). Francis studies at seminary for a year, but is unsure about all of the Church's teachings. He still finds himself in love with Nora, a girl from his home. However, he finds out that after he left, Nora had a child out of wedlock with another man, and she dies before Francis can return to see her. This prompts him to go back to seminary and follow through with his studies, and Francis becomes a priest. Francis' first two assignments as a priest are unfulfilling to him, so the Bishop asks Francis to be a volunteer missionary to China. Francis readily accepts the position, even though that means it would take him far from home as well as far from Judy, Nora's daughter. Francis arrives in Paitan, Chekhow Province in China to find the mission destroyed by floods, and not rebuilt because the true Christians all left, leaving only those who attended to receive free rice.

If I tell you that Most plants cultivate their entire lives and Fertilizer helps them. , and ask you the question \\"what helps plants cultivate their entire live span?\\", is the correct answer \\"fertilizer\\"? Choose your answer from: (1). Yes. (2). No.","completion":"The correct answer would be (1). Yes, fertilizer helps plants cultivate their entire lifespan. However, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive explanation to fully address the question. Plants require essential nutrients, water, air, and sunlight to grow and thrive throughout their entire lifespan. While fertilizer does play a critical role in providing essential nutrients, it is one component among various factors that collectively contribute to plant growth and development. The primary function of fertilizers is to supply plants with essential nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, in addition to several micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. These nutrients are crucial for various biochemical processes, ranging from photosynthesis to cell division, that promote growth and development. Moreover, proper watering is essential in supporting plant growth. Water helps in the absorption of nutrients from the soil, transport of nutrients and other substances within the plant, and in maintaining the plant's turgidity and structural integrity. Water also enables plants to carry out essential physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration. Light, in particular sunlight, is vital for providing plants with the energy they need to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process through which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, that is stored in the form of glucose, also releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This glucose is then used to fuel growth, and oxygen helps in aerobic respiration, ensuring plant survival. Air plays an essential role since the atmosphere supplies plants with carbon dioxide, crucial for photosynthesis, which is derived from the air. Oxygen is required for aerobic respiration, which is critical for providing energy to the plant for its various metabolic processes. In conclusion, while fertilizer is undoubtedly a significant component in helping plants cultivate their entire lifespan, it is essential to understand that it is one aspect of a more comprehensive set of factors. Water, sunlight, and air, along with soil composition and proper care, also substantially contribute to the overall health and success of plant growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lindsey Caroline Vonn (nee Kildow ; born October 18, 1984) is an American World Cup alpine ski racer on the US Ski Team. She has won four World Cup overall championships--one of only two female skiers to do so, along with Annemarie Moser-Proll--with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, plus another in 2012. Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first ever in the event for an American woman. She has also won a record 8 World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008-2013, 2015, 2016), 5 titles in super-G (2009-2012, 2015), and 3 consecutive titles in the combined (2010-2012). At the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events. On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was \\"excruciating\\" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics. Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal. On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill. In her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively. In her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time. Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result. In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event. In her fifth event, the slalom, Vonn lost control and straddled a gate, disqualifying her from the event. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: was she hurt?","completion":"Yes, Lindsey Vonn was hurt. As mentioned in the text, \\"On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week.\\" Vonn described the pain from her injury as \\"excruciating\\" and believed it would make competing at the Winter Olympics difficult."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sentence: Kate runs around a track for 10 minutes and John walks around a track for 10 minutes. Question: Who will produce less sweat? Now let's think about the process of sweating: it is the body's way of regulating temperature, and it generally increases with physical exertion. Running is usually more physically demanding than walking, so one would typically expect someone who is running to produce more sweat than someone who is walking. Our task is to find the **incorrect** answer. The correct answer should be the person who produces *less* sweat. Answer options: A) Kate B) John Since running is more physically demanding than walking, Kate (who is running) is expected to produce more sweat than John (who is walking).

Now, people in some countries start the meal with lettuce as part of a salad. There are hundreds of kinds of lettuce. The main ones include head lettuce, such as iceberg, leaf lettuce,Boston, bibb and romaine. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden. The best time to plant the seeds is during cool weather. The University of Illinois Extension advises that the best planting temperature is 150C. Lettuce seeds are small, so do not place them too deep in the ground. If you plant some seeds every week or two, you will have crops ready to eat one after another. To start the seeds inside, you can use a seed tray in your home or other shelter. This container should be deep enough to hold at least three centimeters of soil or more. There should be about one centimeter of space between the soil and the top of the container. The container should have holes in the bottom so the extra water can flow out. Drop the seeds over the surface and cover them lightly with soil. If the soil is not already a little wet, give it some water. But do not drown the seeds. Next, cover the seed tray with paper. When the seedlings have come up far enough to touch the paper, take it off. You can transplant the seedlings into the garden when they are about two to three centimeters tall. Do this when the weather is not too hot and not too cold. Take out as much soil as you can with the seedlings, Then dig a hole in the ground bigger thanthe lettuce roots. Water the plants but not too heavily. Harvest leaf lettuces when the leaves are big enough to eat. Pull the leaves from the outside of the planting so the inside leaves will keep growing. Or, you can cut off the whole plant. Leave about two or three centimeters above the ground so the plant will re-grow. Cut off head lettuces at ground level. Lettuce is best when served fresh, so make a salad and enjoy. Experts say lettuce is one of the easiest crops to grow in your garden.

The detective on the case, Lt. Stevenson, quickly finds multiple witnesses putting Peralta's lover, Terry Collins, at the scene. However, when Stevenson finds Terry and questions her, she has an iron-clad alibi with multiple witnesses. It is revealed that Terry has an identical twin sister, Ruth, and the pair share the same job and routinely switch places for their own benefit. Stevenson and the district attorney are unable to prosecute, since the twins refuse to confirm which one of them has the alibi. Unable to accept the \\"perfect crime\\", Lt. Stevenson asks Dr. Scott Elliot for help. Scott is an expert on twin study, and has been routinely encountering the Collins twins at their shared place of work, but does not know which one is which. As a front, Scott asks Terry and Ruth if he can study both of them individually as part of his research. The twins accept, though Ruth is worried that Scott might find out that Terry was at Peralta's apartment the night of the murder. However, Terry is attracted to Scott and insists that they can keep the secret for the sake of seeing him. She also comforts Ruth, reminding her that she was only at Peralta's apartment but didn't kill him. From Scott's psychological tests and by spending time with them, he discovers that Ruth is kind and loving, while Terry is highly intelligent, insane, and has been manipulating Ruth almost their entire lives. Terry is jealous that people keep preferring Ruth over her, and is again enraged when Scott falls in love with Ruth instead of her.

Title: Disappointment: A Wasted Opportunity Step 1: Choose a fictional movie title and premise For this review, I will create a fictional movie titled \\"The Time Caravan\\", a science fiction film about a group of explorers who travel through time using a magical vehicle to save the world from an impending apocalypse. Step 2: Critique the plot The plot of \\"The Time Caravan\\" is unoriginal and dull, taking the well-trodden path of time-travel clichés. The storyline is inconsistent, with gaping plot holes and a lack of coherent continuity. The movie's attempts at depicting different time periods feel lazy and unconvincing, with the writers choosing to rely on superficial stereotypes rather than providing any insightful observations about the eras being portrayed. Step 3: Comment on the characters Characters in \\"The Time Caravan\\" are one-dimensional and lack any relatable qualities, making it difficult for viewers to feel any emotional attachment to the protagonists. The film's villain is cartoonish and uninspired, ultimately detracting from any potential narrative tension. Additionally, the romantic subplot feels incredibly forced and undermined by the protagonists' lack of chemistry, leaving the audience feeling emotionally unsatisfied. Step 4: Discuss the visuals and special effects Despite being a science fiction film, the special effects and visual aspects of \\"The Time Caravan\\" fall woefully short of industry standards. The time machine itself is unimaginative in design and, coupled with poorly executed CGI, ends up looking outdated and tacky. The costumes and sets, meant to evoke different time periods, appear cheap and inauthentic, making it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the world of the movie. Step 5: Critique the directing and pacing The pacing of the film is painfully slow, with random, hard-to-follow scene transitions that often lead to confusion for viewers. The director's attempts at creating suspense fall flat, leaving the audience bored and disconnected from the action. Furthermore, the film's obligatory action sequences feel uninspired and lack any real tension, making for a less-than-memorable cinematic experience. Step 6: Conclude the review In conclusion, \\"The Time Caravan\\" is a wasted opportunity that fails to capitalize on its promising concept of time travel. Hindered by bland characters, a predictable plot, subpar visual effects, and uninspired direction, this movie ends up being a lackluster entry in the science fiction genre."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even if you want to..I am anonymous for the same reason. So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook. It will be hard and awkward to attend his marriage. I love him. Who did the author kiss?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: your house in a forest theme. To set the mood for your party, make your home look like the Punxsutawney forest. Cut out pine trees from butcher paper and hang them up on the wall. Use flowers or pinecones as a table centerpiece. You could even have your party outdoors to set the mood. Alternatively, you could separate a room into winter and spring decorations to represent Punxsutawney Phil's big moment. Your guests don't necessarily have to come dressed up as groundhogs. Instead, ask them to come dressed as their favorite woodland animal. If your guests are not as passionate about groundhogs, they could come as a deer, bear, fox, wolf, or owl. Bill Murray's Groundhog Day features a weatherman who must experience the same day over and over until he learns a valuable lesson. Since Groundhog Day thrust the holiday into popular culture, there's no better movie to show at your party. Snuggle up with your friends and a bowl of popcorn, and have a good laugh together. If you do not want to watch Groundhog Day, you could watch a nature documentary on groundhogs instead. For a fun party craft, make groundhog masks out of cardstock. Draw your outline on the cardstock, then cut it out with a sharp pair of scissors. Color your mask with markers, paints, or crayons, then attach ribbon to the sides. You and your guests can now celebrate Groundhog Day in style. As an alternative, you could make animal masks to complement your guests' costumes. No party is complete without treats. You could make traditional Groundhog Day cookies (popularized on the official Punxsutawney website), or you could make a festive cake. Because groundhogs eat vegetation, you could also leave out a veggie tray or fruit bowl. To complete the woodland theme, make a trail mix for your guests to enjoy.

Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all.

Movie title: Courage Under Fire Context: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train. Serling tracks down Ilario using details about Ilario's preferred vacation spot. Ilario tells the true story, revealing that Monfriez wanted to flee while leaving Rady behind.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. (A). No. (B). Yes. Question: what does the universal law of gravitation state? Would \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"The Universal Law of Gravitation, proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. It is mathematically expressed as F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where F is the gravitational force, m1 and m2 are the masses interacting, r is the distance between the centers of these masses, and G is the gravitational constant. The Universal Gravitation Law insists on the universal nature of gravity because its influence extends to every object in the universe, regardless of its size and distance. This fundamental principle governs not just the motion of objects on Earth but also the celestial bodies, including, but not limited to, planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and even light. Thus, introducing the concept of \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation,\\" it's clear this statement is a wholly reasonable response in line with the Universal Law of Gravitation. These objects, like any other masses in the universe, are attracted to each other due to the gravitational interaction dictated by this law. Satellites- whether they are man-made or natural, such as the Moon- obey this law as they continually free-fall towards the Earth (or whichever massive body they are orbiting). Their curved orbital path results from the balance between inertia, the tendency of the satellite to move in a straight line, and the gravitational pull of the massive body. This particular application of the law results in what we recognize as the stable orbits of satellites- a perfect demonstration of Newton's law of universal gravitation. Similarly, projectiles launched on Earth, like a thrown baseball or a fired bullet, also obey the law of gravitation. They follow a parabolic trajectory influenced by the gravitational force of Earth. Although these objects eventually fall to the ground due to Earth's gravity, their initial motion and final impact site are both influenced by the inverse square law at work in the Universal Law of Gravitation. In conclusion, the statement \\"Satellites and projectiles all obey Newton's law of gravitation\\" is indeed a reasonable and accurate reflection of the Universal Law of Gravitation. It highlights the truth that every object, irrespective of its size and the distance from each other, is guided by the unseen but ever-present force that is Gravity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It does not specifically address the narrator's preferences or feelings toward New England, which are essential to establish a personal favorite. Though the premise highlights the attractiveness of New England during the weeks when the bright colors are present, the absence of a direct comparison to other places or clarification of the narrator's feelings prevent the premise from implying or leading to the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because it only provides a description of the beauty of New England in fall, without explicitly connecting it to the narrator's personal preferences or favorites.

SF sues Nevada after it refuses to pay patient dumping bill City Attorney Dennis Herrera wasted little time following through on his threat to file a lawsuit if Nevada didn’t pay up. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera sued the state of Nevada on Tuesday, accusing it of deliberately giving psychiatric patients one-way bus tickets to California in a practice known as patient dumping or “Greyhound therapy”. The class-action lawsuit was filed in San Francisco Superior Court after Nevada officials refused to pay a 500,000 bill the city says it’s due after a state-run mental hospital in Las Vegas bused at least 20 psychiatric patients here and they subsequently received city-sponsored medical care. The lawsuit also accuses Nevada of transporting almost 500 patients to California over about five years in “a manner that jeopardized the patients’ health and also jeopardized the health and safety of their fellow passengers.” It seeks a halt to the practice and reimbursement for all affected California municipalities. Nevada officials contend “proper discharges were made” by the Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada’s primary state mental facility, and that Herrera hasn’t provided evidence to support his bill. “You make a demand for approximately 500,000 but you fail to provide details to support your claim, including how you identified the 20 patients,” Nevada Chief Deputy Attorney General Linda Anderson wrote in the letter dated Monday. Herrera in August gave Nevada until Monday to respond to his demand that the state reimburse San Francisco for about 500,000 he says the city spent on medical care, housing and other aid for 20 psychiatric patients given one-way bus tickets here. In the Aug. 20 letter to Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, Herrera also demanded that Nevada reimburse other California cities and counties for their treatment costs for a combined 500 indigent psychiatric patients who were given one-way bus tickets to the Golden State since 2008. Anderson countered that Herrera has not provided “sufficient explanation of your legal theory or standing for the initiation of a lawsuit by you on behalf of the ‘affected California cities and counties.’ ” She also pointed in her letter to recent press accounts of a mental health patient sent from California to a Nevada hospital, and said that Rawson-Neal had provided care for 771 patients from California during the period Herrera is investigating, July 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013. “Therefore, it could be argued that … the taxpayers of the State of Nevada have subsidized the State of California over 6.2 million during this same period,” Anderson wrote. Herrera’s office contends there’s a difference between a state-run hospital having a policy of busing patients out of state and people voluntarily visiting a state and then needing psychiatric care. “This dispute is about Nevada’s state-sanctioned practice of improperly transporting indigent psychiatric patients,” Herrera’s spokesman, Matt Dorsey, said shortly before the lawsuit was filed. “It’s not about patients who travel between the states voluntarily. We’re disappointed that Nevada officials have declined to take responsibility for their practice, and the city attorney is preparing his response.” The issue of patient dumping — a long-believed, but never proven, contributor to San Francisco’s homeless problem — came to the fore after the Sacramento Bee chronicled the ordeal of a 48-year-old Rawson-Neal patient. He was sent on a 15-hour bus ride to Sacramento, despite having no family or friends in the area, and no arrangements for his care, housing or treatment. Hospital staff told him call 911 when he arrived in Sacramento. Since then, The Chronicle uncovered the similar ordeal of Timothy Martin, a deaf and blind man who found himself homeless on the streets of San Francisco after a one-way ride from a Reno mental hospital. Herrera launched his investigation in April.

I hope so People who live in the free world look at calendars and mark time day by day. I keep track of time not by days but by years. I’ve done so for the past 22 years that I have been incarcerated in the Ohio prison system. My 22nd Christmas behind bars has in many ways been the hardest for me. I’m now incarcerated at a reintegration prison where many of the women I serve time with will be leaving soon to rejoin their families in the community. I’ve always been extremely happy for the women who get to go home, and I have celebrated their departures as if their freedom was my own. What’s hard for me this year is that I feel that I am closer to going home than I ever have been. That’s because victim Holly Lai Holbrook, whose sister Michelle was murdered during the incident I was charged and convicted for participating in, came forward to support my innocence and ask Governor John Kasich to release me. Holly’s support means the world to me. But it also scares me. If Holly’s statement that I am innocent is not enough to bring me home, what will be? Will I ever leave this place? Will I ever experience Christmas with my family again? So this Christmas, freedom feels close but at the same time far away. One recent evening I left the recreation area, which my cell-mates and I decorated with a cardboard Christmas tree and paper ornaments to remind us of home, and returned to my cell for the nightly count. After count, I jumped in the shower and prayed for the day when I would be able to actually take a long bath, something I have not done since 1994. As a giant roach scurried by, I put on my homemade pajamas made out of prison issued sheets. I placed my leftover food – Nacho chip “cornbread” and mashed potatoes made out of potato chips – in the windowsill to remain cold as if in a refrigerator. I then got in bed feeling sad and sorry for myself. As my mind raced back and forth, I thought about how much I missed my family and how I wouldn’t be able to see them on Christmas Day for the 22nd year in a row; no visits are allowed on holidays. I felt so negative and alone as I tossed and turned. I drifted asleep mad at God. But in the middle of the night I awoke after a corrections officer making his rounds shone a light in my cell. And then I remembered something that helps me get through the difficult times: how blessed I am. And the blessings God has given me are so many. First, although I went to prison a sixth grade dropout, I was able to get my education in prison. Not only did I get my GED, but I also earned a steam engineer’s license, which means I can repair and maintain boilers, and a paralegal certificate, among other achievements. I am able to write and express myself now in ways I never could have when I entered prison at the age of 20. Second, I have a family that has stood by me for the past 22 years and has loved me unconditionally. And my family has grown as I have fought for my freedom. Today my family includes not only Momma, her partner and my two living brothers, but also the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who have followed my case and now call for my release. Third, I am so grateful for my legal team. The Ohio Justice & Policy Center has represented me free of charge for the past four years, and has fought for me the way I wish I would have been represented at my trial. I will always owe a debt to OJPC for what it has done for me. Lastly, but most importantly, although I don’t like living in an environment where almost every aspect of my life is controlled, at least I’m fortunate enough to draw breath each day. I look forward to the day when I will get to pursue my dreams. Michelle Lai never got that chance. While some may feel sorry for me, they shouldn’t. When I feel tempted to wallow in self-pity, I create art that transports me – mentally and spiritually – beyond the bars that confine me physically. So, no matter how bad I may feel from time to time, I know my suffering is only a tiny fraction of the pain the Lai family and the other victims have experienced. Maybe this will be my last Christmas in prison. I certainly hope it is. But if it is not, I will find a way to keep going and to survive, hopefully marking the calendar in days, not years. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"This heartfelt reflection from a person incarcerated for 22 years shares their longing for potential release and the uncertainty of their future, while expressing gratitude for their support system and acknowledging the pain of the victims involved in their case.

Is \\"They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Imagine you have a piece of string that's very thin, and another string that's thicker. If you rub them really fast, the thin string will break much more quickly than the thick one. This is because the thin string can't handle the heat and pressure as well as the thicker one. In the case of a light bulb, the \\"string\\" is called a filament. When we turn on the light, the filament gets very hot and starts to glow, giving us light. If the filament is thicker, it can handle more heat without breaking, just like the thicker string. So, yes, you are right! A thicker filament in a light bulb can run hotter for the same lifetime before it breaks (or in science words, \\"evaporates\\"). This means the bulb with a thicker filament can give us more light or last longer before we need to replace it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: - They secrete digestive juice &#x27;externally&#x27; into the small intestine - There are enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins , and carbohydrates - Digestive juices flows from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine - When the blood sugar levels rise, as they might after a meal, insulin is released - When blood sugar levels are too low, the pancreas releases glucagon into the bloodstream - What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process in the context of the given information involves the ingestion and digestion of food, specifically its arrival in the small intestine. When food has been well-mixed with the stomach's gastric juices, it is progressively released into the small intestine as a semi-liquid substance called chyme. Here, the activation of the pancreas comes into play. The small intestine, through the presence of chyme, triggers the release of a hormone known as secretin. This hormone signals the pancreas to secrete its digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine. Digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates is facilitated by the enzymes that are found in the pancreatic secretions. These enzymes include lipases for fats breakdown, proteases for proteins breakdown, and amylases for carbohydrates breakdown. The digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine, where the process of digestion and nutrient absorption continues. Concurrently, the pancreas also has a major role in regulating blood sugar levels. When blood sugar levels rise, as might happen after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin, a hormone that helps cells of the body to absorb glucose from the bloodstream and store it. This reduces the amount of glucose in the blood, bringing blood sugar levels back to normal. On the other hand, when blood sugar levels are too low (for example, during fasting or prolonged periods without eating), the pancreas releases another hormone called glucagon. Glucagon stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream, raising blood sugar levels back to normal. In summary, the first step of the process is the arrival of chyme in the small intestine, which stimulates the release of secretin. This hormone triggers the pancreas to secrete its digestive enzymes for the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, while concurrently regulating blood sugar levels through the release of insulin and glucagon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method . The planet is at least 24 % more massive than Jupiter . The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth 's distance from the Sun. However , the orbit is very eccentric , so at periastron this distance is almost halved , and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000 , a group of scientists proposed , based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite , that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8 ° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination . If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk , which seems a plausible assumption , it would have an inclination of 40 ° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter , however later observations failed to confirm the disk 's existence . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - HD 210277 is a 7th magnitude star in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) with a mass around 0.92 times that of our Sun. Since its distance is about 70 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With binoculars it is easily visible. What is the relationship between 'hd 210277 b' and 'aquarius'? Answer:","completion":"HD 210277 b is an extrasolar planet that orbits the star HD 210277, which is located in the constellation of Aquarius. The relationship between HD 210277 b and Aquarius lies in the fact that the star, around which the planet revolves, is situated within the boundaries of the Aquarius constellation. The constellation of Aquarius is a group of stars that forms a specific pattern in the night sky, and it is one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. HD 210277, the host star of HD 210277 b, is a 7th magnitude yellow dwarf star (with a spectral type of G0V) and has a mass of approximately 0.92 times that of our Sun. It is situated about 70 light-years away from Earth. Although it is not visible to the unaided eye due to its distance, HD 210277 can be observed using binoculars or telescopes. HD 210277 b, the planet orbiting this star, was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team, using the radial velocity method. The planet has an eccentric orbit, with a mean distance from its host star slightly greater than Earth's distance from the Sun. The eccentricity of its orbit causes the planet's distance from its star to vary, being nearly halved at periastron and almost equal to Mars' distance from the Sun at apastron.

She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. SimÃ³n claims to see a boy named TomÃ¡s (Ãscar Casas). He befriends TomÃ¡s and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo (Montserrat Carulla) informs Laura that SimÃ³n's adoption file indicates that SimÃ³n is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. She later finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, SimÃ³n teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to SimÃ³n's adoption file. SimÃ³n becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon. During a party at the orphanage, Laura and SimÃ³n argue, and SimÃ³n hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. Escaping, she finds that SimÃ³n is missing and she is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted SimÃ³n. Six months later, SimÃ³n is still missing. Searching in a Spanish city, Laura spots Benigna who is then struck and killed by a car. The police find evidence that Benigna once worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named TomÃ¡s who was interned there. The children stole a mask that TomÃ¡s wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, TomÃ¡s hid in a local sea cave and was subsequently drowned. His death occurred weeks after Laura was adopted. Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin) in the search for SimÃ³n. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for...

On Saturday, it didn’t need a buzzer-beating shot to win, and fans didn’t even storm the court afterward. Victor Oladipo scored the go-ahead basket on a fast-break layup with 36 seconds left and No. 13 Indiana upset No. 2 Ohio State, 74-70, the first time Indiana has defeated the nation’s top two teams in the same season. Indiana’s win over Kentucky three weeks ago was only the second time the Hoosiers had beaten a No. 1 team at Assembly Hall. On Saturday, the Hoosiers (13-1, 1-1 Big Ten) added another chapter to their rapid re-emergence. But Saturday’s celebration paled in comparison with the storm-the-court stampede that followed the win over Kentucky. Part of the explanation was that the students were on holiday break this time. The other reason: it was not as big a surprise. The Hoosiers were far from perfect. They shot 45.8 percent, about five percentage points below their season average, and they were outrebounded, 35-28. “It came down to us not being able to get a stop,” Ohio State guard Aaron Craft said. “Give them credit. They just kept coming back and coming back and knocking down big shot after big shot.” KENTUCKY 69, LOUISVILLE 62 The freshman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist had 24 points and 19 rebounds to lead No. 3 Kentucky (13-1) in a rough-and-tumble victory at Rupp Arena. Physical play at times turned the game into more of a free-throw shooting contest; 52 fouls were called. No. 4 Louisville (12-2) led only once, at 2-0. UCONN 83, ST. JOHN’S 69 UConn let a 23-point second-half lead slip to 11 before beating the Red Storm in Hartford in the second game of Coach Jim Calhoun’s three-game N.C.A.A. suspension for recruiting violations. Shabazz Napier had 17 points and 9 assists to lead the Huskies. The freshman Andre Drummond added 16 points and 11 rebounds, and Jeremy Lamb chipped in with 15 points as UConn (12-1, 2-0 Big East) won its seventh straight game. St. John’s (7-6, 1-1) was also without its head coach, as Steve Lavin continues to recover from prostate cancer surgery. Lavin, who has coached four games this season, missed his seventh in a row. There is no timetable for his return. Calhoun will be back on the bench for Saturday’s game against Rutgers. FLORIDA 90, YALE 70 Kenny Boynton’s 26 points led No. 10 Florida (11-3) over Yale less than 40 hours after the Gators were upset at Rutgers. Greg Mangano led Yale (8-4) with 26 points and 15 rebounds. IOWA 72, WISCONSIN 65 The freshman reserve Aaron White scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half as Iowa (9-6, 1-1 Big Ten) won at Wisconsin. The 11th-ranked Badgers (12-3, 1-1), who came in allowing a national-best 44.4 points a game, had not given up more than 61 in any game. But they failed to keep up with the Hawkeyes, in part because they shot 3 for 28 on 3-pointers. GEORGETOWN 49, PROVIDENCE 40 Henry Sims scored 5 of his 11 points in the final seven minutes for No. 12 Georgetown (12-1, 2-0 Big East), which made only eight field goals in the second half. Providence (11-4, 0-2) has lost 17 straight Big East road games. MISSISSIPPI ST. 66, UTAH ST. 64 Rodney Hood scored 16 points and Arnett Moultrie added 15, but No. 15 Mississippi State (13-2) needed a defensive stop on its final possession to win. MICHIGAN ST. 68, NEBRASKA 55 Draymond Green scored 19 points and Keith Appling had 8 of his 14 in the last seven minutes for No. 16 Michigan State (13-2, 2-0 Big Ten), which has won 13 in a row after an 0-2 start. KANSAS 84, NORTH DAKOTA 58 North Dakota had no answer for the 6-foot-10 Thomas Robinson, who posted career highs with 30 points and 21 rebounds for No. 17 Kansas (10-3). IN OTHER GAMES Kyle Casey scored 7 of his 26 points in the closing 4:25 as No. 24 Harvard (12-1) rallied from an 11-point deficit to beat visiting St. Joseph’s, 74-69. ... Anthony Marshall had 19 points and 13 rebounds as No. 19 U.N.L.V. (15-2) beat Hawaii, 74-69, in Honolulu. STANFORD 77, U.C.L.A. 50 Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike each posted double-doubles for the second straight game to lead No. 4 Stanford. DEPAUL 65, N. ILLINOIS 46 Doug Bruno earned his 500th victory as No. 21 DePaul won at home. He is 500-273 in 26 seasons.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence.

Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Answer the following question: protein that serves as the precursor molecular for thyroid hormones?","completion":"The precursor molecule for thyroid hormones is Thyroglobulin, a large glycoprotein that serves as the scaffold for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and a smaller amount of triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones are essential for regulating various physiological processes like metabolism, growth, and development throughout the body. Thyroglobulin is synthesized within the thyroid gland by thyroid follicular cells, also known as thyrocytes. After being synthesized, it is stored in large quantities within the colloid of the thyroid follicles. Thyroglobulin is comprised of 660 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 330 kDa. It contains several tyrosine residues, which play a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. The biosynthesis of thyroid hormones involves a series of steps: 1. Iodide uptake: Diet-derived iodide ions are actively transported from the bloodstream into the thyroid follicular cells through a membrane-bound transporter called the Sodium/Iodide Symporter (NIS). 2. Iodide oxidation and organification: Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide ions are oxidized to reactive iodine by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase (TPO). TPO catalyzes the binding of this reactive iodine to the tyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin molecule through a process called organification or iodination. 3. Coupling: The iodinated tyrosines within the thyroglobulin molecule are then coupled together to form either T3 (containing three iodine atoms) or T4 (containing four iodine atoms). Once again, this reaction is catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase. 4. Endocytosis and proteolysis: When thyroid hormones are required, thyroglobulin is endocytosed back into the follicular cells in the form of colloid droplets. Inside the cell, proteolytic enzymes cleave the iodinated thyroglobulin molecule, releasing T3 and T4 from the scaffold. 5. Secretion: The liberated T4 and T3 are then transported across the basolateral membrane of the follicular cells into the bloodstream via transporters such as Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 (MCT8) and Monocarboxylate Transporter 10 (MCT10), where they will be bound to globulin proteins for distribution throughout the body. 6. Activation and deactivation: The majority of the secreted thyroid hormone is T4. However, T3 is the more metabolically active form, which means that T4 is converted to T3 in the peripheral tissues by deiodinase enzymes. Additionally, T3 can be converted to its inactive form, reverse T3 (rT3), depending on the body's needs. In summary, thyroglobulin is the precursor molecule that serves as the foundation for the synthesis of essential thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. This process entails a series of orchestrated steps, including iodide uptake, iodination, coupling, endocytosis, proteolysis, secretion, activation, and deactivation, to ensure the optimal levels of these hormones are maintained throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Eccentric 70-year-old widow Mrs Laura Henderson purchases it as a post-widowhood hobby and appoints autocratic manager Vivian Van Damm. In 1937, they start a continuous variety revue called \\"Revudeville\\", but after other theatres in London copy this innovation, they begin losing money. Mrs Henderson suggests they add female nudity, similar to the Moulin Rouge in Paris, which is unprecedented in the United Kingdom. The Lord Chamberlain (Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer) reluctantly allows this under the condition that the nude performers remain immobile, so the performances can be considered art, the equivalent of nude statues in museums. Because the theatre's auditorium is below street level it is relatively safe during the bombing of London, and performances continue. The performers bravely go on with the show even during frightening bombing raids, and the posed nude girls resume their poses, after ducking, as the whole theatre is shaken and the scene flats all round them sway when a bomb lands close by. Maureen, one of the cast, becomes involved at Mrs Henderson's instigation with a young soldier, one of the audience regulars. Maureen becomes pregnant, is very upset about how it will affect her life, and hands in her notice. However, before the issue can be resolved, she is killed by a bomb while leaving the theatre. Other scenes depict life in the theatre during the period. Mrs Henderson and Mr Van Damm frequently clash and squabble, but also show great appreciation for each other. Eventually, the authorities want the theatre to close because of the danger of crowds gathering in the street outside the theatre. However, Mrs Henderson successfully argues: for soldiers going to die in the war this is their last chance, and for many of the young soldiers their only chance, to see female nudity.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The decisions for Victoria were a lot harder than those of Christine, because Options are: + Victoria was undecided. + Christine was undecided.","completion":"The decisions for Victoria were a lot harder than those of Christine, primarily because Victoria was undecided. Victoria, known for her cautious nature, would find herself constantly wrestling with decision-making, while Christine seemed to breeze through it all without a second thought. To better understand why Victoria's decisions were more challenging, let's examine the reasons and circumstances that contributed to her indecisiveness. Firstly, Victoria's upbringing played a significant role in her decision-making struggles. Raised in a conservative family where every choice had considerable consequences, she learned to weigh every option with great care. Her reserved demeanor was a reflection of the importance her family placed on cautious thinking and risk minimization. Secondly, Victoria had a more analytical and detail-oriented thought process. As a result, her decision-making would involve exhaustive exploration of every available option and potential outcome. This inclination to carefully evaluate and process information before making choices only served to prolong her decision-making time. In contrast, Christine was much more quick to decide. Her spontaneity and impulsive nature allowed her to approach decisions fearlessly and without overthinking or dwelling on potential negative outcomes. It's not that Christine ignored potential risks or consequences, but rather, she was willing to trust her instincts and confidently stand by her choices regardless of the outcome. Some would argue this level of decisiveness helped Christine in seizing unique opportunities and beneficial situations that others might dismiss due to hesitancy and over-analysis. Moreover, Christine's upbringing was quite different from Victoria's. In a more liberal and open-minded environment, Christine was given the autonomy to make her own decisions from a young age. She was encouraged to learn from her mistakes and develop a more carefree attitude towards decision-making. It is also important to note that personality traits played a crucial role in shaping their decision-making abilities. Victoria's introspective and careful nature, influenced by her upbringing, would result in slower, more deliberate choices. On the other hand, Christine's extroverted and adventurous personality would lead her to embrace a more active and assertive decision-making style. To sum up, the decisions for Victoria were more difficult than those of Christine mainly because Victoria was undecided. Her upbringing, personality, and analytical thought process created an environment where making decisions became an arduous task. In contrast, Christine enjoyed quicker, more assertive decision-making, which allowed her to adapt and seize opportunities in a rapidly changing world. While each person's decision-making style has its pros and cons, it's evident that Victoria's indecisiveness made her decision-making process not only challenging but also emotionally exhausting. Understanding their personal motivations and mental processes can help shed light on why some decisions may be harder for some individuals while easier for others."},{"prompt":"Information: - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which mammal has a name which means 'river horse' in Greek?","completion":"The mammal with a name that translates to 'river horse' in Greek is the Hippopotamus. The name comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: 'hippos' (ἵππος), meaning 'horse', and 'potamos' (ποταμός), meaning 'river'. Hippopotamuses, or hippos for short, are large herbivorous animals native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are the third-largest terrestrial mammals, only behind elephants and some rhinoceros species in terms of size and weight. Adult male hippos can weigh between 1,500 to 1,800 kilograms (3,300 to 4,000 pounds), while females tend to be lighter, usually weighing between 1,300 to 1,500 kilograms (2,800 to 3,300 pounds). Hippos have distinct features such as a barrel-shaped body, a semi-aquatic lifestyle, and a large head with a wide-opening mouth. Their relatively short legs and barrel shape allow them to move effortlessly through water, while their strong, muscular jaws can open at nearly a 180-degree angle to allow them to graze on large amounts of vegetation. These animals are well adapted to their aquatic environment, with eyes, ears, and nostrils situated at the top of their heads, allowing them to breathe and observe their surroundings while being mostly submerged. Hippos can easily stay underwater for up to 5 minutes without coming up for air. They typically spend the cooler parts of the day lounging in rivers, lakes, and swamps to stay protected from the harsh sun and keep their sensitive skin moist. At night, they venture onto land to graze on grasses and other vegetation. Although hippos may seem sluggish and docile, they are known to be unpredictable and aggressive, which contributes to their status as one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. With a set of powerful, sharp teeth and a fast running speed that can reach up to 30 kilometers per hour (19 miles per hour) on land, they are known to defend their territories aggressively and attack when they feel threatened. Hippopotamuses play a significant ecological role by maintaining aquatic vegetation and shaping the ecosystem of the bodies of water they inhabit. They are also known to create channels in swamps and other wetlands, which can help regulate water flow. Unfortunately, due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the common hippopotamus as a vulnerable species, emphasizing the need for continued conservation efforts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer a question about this article: Cold or oxygen-rich atmospheres can sustain life at pressures much lower than atmospheric, as long as the density of oxygen is similar to that of standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there. Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent altitude sickness in humans that did not undergo prior acclimatization, and spacesuits are necessary to prevent ebullism above 19 km. Most spacesuits use only 20 kPa (150 Torr) of pure oxygen.

Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have -137*w and 4*w. -137*w + 4*w = -133*w On the right side of the equation, we have -43*w and 93*w. -43*w + 93*w = 50*w So the equation becomes: -133*w - 7503 = 50*w Step 2: Move all terms with w to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, we will add 133*w to both sides of the equation: -133*w - 7503 + 133*w = 50*w + 133*w which simplifies to: -7503 = 183*w Next, we'll isolate w by dividing both sides of the equation by 183: -7503 / 183 = 183*w / 183 Step 3: Solve for w.

Canadian waterfall makes for one incredibly dangerous water slide Thrill seekers visiting British Columbia’s Lynn Canyon Park have found an epic way to beat the summer heat – but have been urged to be more cautious after footage of their far out stunts went viral. Video posted online shows a group of brave tourists barrelling down a natural water slide in the park, ending in a stomach-churning 11 metre drop into waters below. Constantly flowing water has polished the rock face over a long period of time, making the natural slide especially slippery. But the viral videos have drawn the attention of local officials, including North Vancouver’s District Deputy Fire Chief Wayne Kennedy. “When we see or hear about the videos that get posted popularizing the canyon and cliff jumping, it does cause some concern,” he told The Weather Network. The depth of the water is unclear from the video; however dry conditions in the area have contributed to lower water levels than usual, making such jumps especially dangerous.

However, research shows that where their academic attainment is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

Question: what are the top three laws in science I found the following answer on Google: Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, universal constants emerge from scientific laws. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"The answer you found on Google refers to the emergence of universal constants in scientific laws, which is indeed an important aspect of science. However, this answer does not directly address the question about the top three laws in science. Thus, the response you found is not a direct answer to your question, although it's related to scientific laws in general. Identifying the top three laws in science could be subjective, as it depends on the context of the scientific field and its major contributions. However, let me provide you with three fundamental laws from different areas in science that have significantly impacted our understanding of the world. 1. Newton's Laws of Motion (Physics): Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time, proposed three fundamental laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it. These laws have far-reaching applications in various fields, such as engineering, mechanics, and aeronautics. a. Newton's First Law (Inertia): An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. b. Newton's Second Law (Force): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration (F = ma). c. Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 2. Law of Universal Gravitation (Physics): Another major contribution by Sir Isaac Newton, the law of universal gravitation states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2). This law is fundamental in understanding the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies in the universe. 3. Mendelian Laws of Inheritance (Biology): Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance are fundamental principles in genetics and have had a profound impact on our understanding of heredity and traits in living organisms. Mendel's laws include: a. Law of Segregation: During gamete formation, the two alleles of a gene segregate so that the offspring acquires one allele from each parent. b. Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits assort independently of one another during gamete formation. c. Law of Dominance: When two organisms with contrasting traits are bred, the offspring will express the dominant trait. While it's difficult to narrow down the top three laws in science, these laws mentioned above have had a significant impact on scientific knowledge and various applications in the modern world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: opposition leader morales heads voting preference poll in bolivia Text:","completion":"Title: Morales Leads as the Preferred Candidate in Bolivia's Upcoming Elections In the latest political developments in Bolivia, former President and now opposition leader, Evo Morales, has emerged as the frontrunner in the Bolivian voting preference poll. A charismatic and popular figure, Morales' ascendancy signifies a potential return to power for the Movement for Socialism (MAS), the party he founded and led for more than 13 years before being ousted in 2019. Evo Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, served three consecutive terms from 2006 to 2019. Throughout his tenure, Morales implemented numerous progressive policies focused on reducing poverty and inequality, as well as nationalizing key industries. His actions led to significant improvement in Bolivia's social and economic indicators, which gained him widespread support from the working class and indigenous majority. However, his term was not without controversy, as there were allegations of corruption and authoritarianism during his rule. After being declared the winner of the disputed 2019 presidential election, Morales faced widespread protests and accusations of electoral fraud from opposition parties and international organizations, including the Organization of American States. Amid escalating tensions and violence, the military urged him to step down, leading to his resignation and eventual exile in Mexico and Argentina. Since Evo Morales' departure, Bolivia has been governed by an interim president, Jeanine Áñez, who's faced her own set of challenges in trying to stabilize the nation. The political landscape has seen no shortage of uncertainty and unrest, and many Bolivians hope that the upcoming elections will mark a turning point for the country. The recent voting preference poll demonstrates the remarkable resilience of Evo Morales' political influence in Bolivia. Despite being barred from running for a fourth presidential term by the Bolivian Constitutional Court, Morales has strategically positioned himself and his party for a potential comeback. The poll shows that, as an opposition leader, Morales' popularity remains intact; this is a testament to his enduring allure amongst the electorate. The Movement for Socialism's (MAS) lead in the voting preference poll denotes the possibility of a dramatic return to power, which could reshape Bolivia's political future. The MAS, known for its pro-indigenous, socialist ideals, has pledged to continue the policies that were enacted during Morales' time in power, such as nationalization, social welfare programs, and infrastructure development. In conclusion, the results of the Bolivian voting preference poll reveal a significant shift towards the opposition leader, Evo Morales, and his Movement for Socialism, as the country prepares for its upcoming elections. The MAS's potential return to power demonstrates Morales' enduring influence and popularity, as well as the party's commitment to addressing social and economic inequality in Bolivia. As the nation seeks stability after a turbulent period, all eyes will be on the election outcomes to determine the direction of this South American country moving forward."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: If parents bring up a child with the aim of turning the child into a genius , they will cause great damage to him. According to several leading educational experts, this is one of the biggest mistakes that some parents make. Generally, the child will understand very well what the parents expect, and will fall. Unrealistic expectations of the parents can cause great damage to children. However, if parents are realistic about what they expect their children to do, and are hopeful in a sensible way, the child may succeed -especially if the parents are very supportive to their children. Michael Li is very lucky. He is very fond of music and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and let him attend piano and violin lessons. Although his father is a good musician, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling to. Michael's friend, Winston Chen, however, is not so lucky. Both his parents are successful musicians, and they set too high a goal for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are and so they enter him for every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. \\"When I was your age, I used to win every competition I entered.\\" Winston's father tells him. Winston is always afraid that he will disappoint his parents and now he is always quiet and unhappy. Question: Winston's parents set so high a goal for him that _ .

This is evident in the article as Winston's parents constantly enter him into piano competitions and express their unhappiness when he does not win, ultimately causing Winston to become quiet and unhappy. Rather than motivating him to strive for greatness, this high-pressure environment induces fear and anxiety in Winston, as he is always worried about meeting his parents' extremely high expectations."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: In May 1885, Jonathan Harker arrives at the castle of Count Dracula near Klausenburg (Cluj), to take up his post as librarian.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philadelphia, returns home one night with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

The judge tried both father and son in separate trials.","completion":"No, the word \\"try\\" is not used in the same way in the following two sentences. In these sentences, \\"try\\" has two different meanings and functions. Let's analyze these meanings in detail: 1. \\"Try the yak butter.\\" In this sentence, \\"try\\" is used as a verb with the meaning of \\"to test or experiment with something to see if it is satisfactory or suitable.\\" Here, the speaker is suggesting that the listener should taste or sample the yak butter in order to experience or evaluate its flavor and qualities. This usage of \\"try\\" is commonly found in everyday speech when people are suggesting, for instance, that someone should taste a new dish, wear a piece of clothing, or use a new product. This meaning is more related to personal experience, with the focus on the sensory or practical aspects of the activity being suggested. 2. \\"The judge tried both father and son in separate trials.\\" In this sentence, \\"try\\" takes on a different meaning as a verb, which is \\"to examine and determine the issues in a case through a judicial process.\\" In this context, the judge is the person who is conducting the legal process to decide whether the father and son have committed an offense based on the presented evidence and arguments in the trials. This meaning of \\"try\\" is related to law and the judicial system, and it implies the investigation and examination of facts, testimonies, and legal procedures in order to make a verdict. This usage has a more formal connotation than the one found in the first example. So, even though the word \\"try\\" appears in both sentences, its meaning and application in each context are distinct. In the first sentence, it conveys the idea of sampling or testing something new, while the second sentence addresses the concept of conducting a legal examination in a courtroom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A Journal Review: This book tells of the grief period that a woman went through after losing a loved one. It was well written, and she poured her soul into it. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that the product review has a predominantly positive tone. This can be inferred from various aspects of the review which I will discuss in detail. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the book was \\"well written,\\" suggesting that they appreciated the author's writing style and found it engaging. This highlights the reviewer's positive perspective of the literary quality of the book, indicating that the story was conveyed in a manner that successfully captured the reader's attention. Secondly, the statement, \\"she poured her soul into it,\\" signifies that the reviewer believes the author was able to communicate genuine emotions throughout the story. This level of emotional depth can be considered a strength of the book, as it demonstrates the authenticity with which the author shares her experiences. Additionally, the reader might have formed a strong connection with the author and empathized with her struggles, further contributing to the positive aspects of the review. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the review revolves around the theme of grief which, by nature, carries a sense of negativity. The subject matter might be considered heavy or emotionally draining for some readers, who may view the book as a challenging read due to its emotionally taxing content. This is not to say that exploring grief is inherently negative, but it is important to recognize that some readers may react strongly to such topics. In conclusion, the overall tone of this product review can be considered positive, as it praises the book's writing quality and the author's ability to passionately communicate her emotions. While the heavy subject matter might elicit negative emotions or reactions from some readers, this does not detract from the reviewer's evaluation of the book's strengths.

Answer based on context: Coming off their loss to the Chargers, the Cowboys hosted the Denver Broncos at home for an interconference duel. The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown.

The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. In the second half, the Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). Following an intercepted Broncos' pass, the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater. As the shootout continued, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter.

The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, \\"The Great Gatsby\\" explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Alan Walbridge Ladd (September 3, 1913 January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film and television producer.

The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A film genre (or ) is a motion picture category based on similarities in either the narrative elements or the emotional response to the film (namely, serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary genre criticism. The basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other subgenres include the courtroom and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \\"Evil Dead\\" films. Other popular combinations are the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. - The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is \\"Trigger Mortis\\" by Anthony Horowitz, published in September 2015.

The supporting cast includes Robert Preston and Brenda Marshall. - War film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film. - Two Years Before the Mast is a memoir by the American author Richard Henry Dana Jr., published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage from Boston to California on a merchant ship starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - O.S.S. is a 1946 war film starring Alan Ladd and Geraldine Fitzgerald about the Office of Strategic Services , directed by Irving Pichel , who would soon be blacklisted and written by Richard Maibaum , a World War Two vet who would later write 12 of the first 15 James Bond films .

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the United States during World War II, and a predecessor of the modern Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OSS was formed as an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to coordinate espionage activities behind enemy lines for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Other OSS functions included the use of propaganda, subversion, and post-war planning. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. - Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922 July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake won both popular and critical acclaim, most notably for her role in \\"Sullivan's Travels\\" and for her femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd, during the 1940s.

If the room you’re working in has external windows, open these as wide as possible. If you’d like to take a further safety precaution, rent a vapor-rated respirator and wear it while you’re staining the pine floor. You can rent a vapor-rated respirator at a local hardware or home supply store. Since you’ll be working with the windows open, it’s advisable to finish the pine flooring on a warm, rain-free day. If you are not impressed with the natural color of the pine flooring and would like to darken it, you can purchase a stain to seal and darken the pine. Visit your local paint store and ask to peruse their stain selection. Speak with the sales staff to determine which brand and variety of stain is best for your flooring, considering its location in your house and the amount of use it will receive. The major difference between stain and varnish is that varnish will dry clear while stain will darken the color of your flooring. So, if you prefer the natural color of the pine flooring and just want to seal it to protect against moisture and scratches, opt for a varnish. Unlike oil, varnish adheres to the top of the wood without soaking deep into the grain. Consequently, you can remove varnish if you decide to. Oil cannot be removed from wood. Oils are a traditional softwood finish that will penetrate deep into the pine flooring. Oil finishes—unlike many varnishes—won’t peel or flake, and often look better with age. Types of oil commonly used to finish pine floors include: Tung oil, which has a relatively low level of sheen. This leaves the pine with a more “natural” appearance. Linseed oil, which is tarry and so brings out the grain of the pine. Lemon or walnut oil, which are considered specialty oils and may be more expensive. Before you stain the entire floor, test the stain in an inconspicuous are to make sure that you like the color. Apply the stain using a 3 in (7.6 cm) paintbrush. Let the stain dry for 24 hours. If you like the appearance of the stained sample patch, you can proceed with staining the entire floor. If you don’t like the appearance of the stained wood, select a different colored stain. Or, if you realize that you prefer the natural color of unstained pine, opt for a clear varnish instead.","completion":"Fumes from stain or varnish can be harmful to one's health, so it is essential to take necessary precautions while working with these substances, especially when staining or varnishing pine flooring. To ensure proper ventilation, open external windows as wide as possible, and consider renting a vapor-rated respirator from a local hardware or home supply store for added safety. To achieve the desired color or protective finish on pine flooring, choose between stain, varnish, or oil. Stain darkens the wood, while varnish provides a clear protective layer on top of the wood without changing its natural color.

If dissatisfied, either choose a different color of stain or opt for a clear varnish to maintain the natural color of the pine flooring. When working on pine flooring, it is also crucial to choose a warm, rain-free day, as windows should be open for ventilation purposes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, many may assume that I'm some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered \\"classic\\" horror. This is not the case, as I'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life. But admittedly, I'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher/zombie/ghost/cannibal, etc...types of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster-paced. Just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film...I just don't... THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls. The heavy-handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand (or whip in some cases...) to keep the girls in line. She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower (in their nightgowns no less (?!?)...), and meanwhile, girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who's lurking about the campus... I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA (which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion...), in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake. I'm all for \\"tension\\" and \\"suspense\\" in horror films - but this film held neither for me. Luckily, I wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one, so I can't say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally don't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70's. This isn't a hard and fast rule, but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What addition was covered in gold?\\" Context: \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The addition covered in gold mentioned in the given context is the ceiling in the Blue Drawing Room, which was designed by architect John Nash. Queen Mary was responsible for the decoration of this room, and the elaborate ceiling features coffered design with large gilt console brackets, giving it the appearance of being covered in gold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"He hopes a streamlined and more efficient network can be put in place to ensure that Floridians who need help have access to it.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The current network in Florida is not streamlined.\\"?","completion":"From the given premise, it can be inferred that the person expressing this idea believes that there is indeed room for improvement in the current network in Florida, specifically in terms of its efficiency and streamlining. The premise suggests that the current network may not be meeting the intended goal of providing Floridians with adequate access to help. Consequently, it also implies that the person making this statement considers restructuring or altering the existing system to be a necessary measure in order to meet these needs. Now, let us examine the hypothesis: \\"The current network in Florida is not streamlined.\\" This hypothesis, in essence, proposes that the network in question is not designed or organized effectively. In other words, it contends that the current system is not optimized for maximal performance. The premise and the hypothesis appear to be logically connected. The desire for a \\"streamlined and more efficient network\\" expressed in the premise, indicates a belief that the present system is lacking in these aspects. This subsequently aligns with the notion put forth in the hypothesis—that the existing network is not, in fact, streamlined. Therefore, one might conclude that the premise provides reasonable evidence in support of the hypothesis. The assertion that a more efficient and streamlined network is desirable in Florida implies a perception that the current system is not sufficiently optimized to most effectively serve Floridians in need of help. However, it is important to note that while the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is strong, it still may not establish the hypothesis as an irrefutable fact. Additional context and evidence would be needed to fully substantiate the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Ash might want to make up with Sasha because they were tired of arguing and desired to resolve the conflict and restore their relationship to a more positive state. In considering the context, making up is a reasonable expectation when two people are tired of arguing and want to fix the situation. This sentiment suggests that both Sasha and Ash value their relationship and would like to return to a state of understanding and harmony. The process of making up usually involves apologies, open communication, and willingness to listen to each other, which can help rebuild trust and emotional connection. However, it is important to remember that people are complex, and personalities might affect the outcome. Ash might initially feel hurt or frustrated, leading to a desire for some alone time before being ready to make up. This indicates that while \\"make up\\" is a valid answer, it might not be the only possible outcome.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... Question: What takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy?

A. live long B. leave home C. feel pain D. eating E. sense fear in human The best answer is The answer is:","completion":"C. feel pain As animals age, they undergo various changes in their bodies similar to humans. These changes can lead to a decline in their physical and mental abilities. Thus, the best answer to the question \\"What does an animal do when it becomes old?\\" is C. feel pain, as it encompasses the age-related discomforts and ailments that an older animal is likely to experience. Let's discuss this answer in more detail along with the other options for a deeper understanding. A. Live long: While it is true that animals have varied lifespans, simply becoming old doesn't guarantee a longer life. In fact, as animals age, they become more susceptible to illness and injuries, which can lead to a shortened life expectancy. B. Leave home: Generally, animals do not leave their homes or territories because of old age. However, their ability to maintain and defend their territories may be affected as they get older, making them more vulnerable to competitors. C. Feel pain: As mentioned earlier, this option is the most accurate answer. As animals age, they become more prone to experiencing pain and discomfort due to deteriorating body functions, joint issues, and other age-related ailments. For instance, older dogs can develop arthritis, which causes pain and stiffness in their joints. Old age can also exacerbate existing health conditions, leading to increased discomfort and pain. D. Eating: While eating is an essential activity for animals throughout their lives, it doesn't adequately describe their experience as they age. Older animals may face difficulties in eating due to dental problems or a decrease in their sense of smell and taste, but this doesn't holistically describe their overall condition when they get old. E. Sense fear in human: This option is unrelated to an animal's experience of aging. Animals can have varying sensitivity to human emotions based on their species, individual personality, and level of socialization. However, this ability is not directly connected to the aging process. In conclusion, the most accurate answer to the question is C. feel pain, as it highlights the physical challenges and discomforts that animals are likely to encounter as they grow older. While the other options may hold some relevance, they do not capture the essence of an animal's experience during old age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, both Phu Quoc Ridgeback and Mudi are breeds of dogs. They are distinct in their characteristics, appearances, and origins, but they share common traits as they both belong to the canine species. Let's delve deeper into their background and features to have a better understanding of these two fascinating dog breeds. Phu Quoc Ridgeback: The Phu Quoc Ridgeback originates from Phu Quoc Island – a Vietnamese island situated in the Gulf of Thailand. Known for its pristine beaches and impressive wildlife, the island is also famous as the home of these unique dogs. Although not as well-known worldwide compared to other breeds, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback has long been a valuable companion to the island's residents. Appearance-wise, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a medium-sized dog with a lean and muscular build. They have short, glossy coats that come in three primary colors: jet black, black with reddish-brown markings, and golden-yellow or tawny. One distinguishing feature of these dogs is the ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction along their back, starting from the shoulders and extending to the hip. The hair-ridge is a characteristic trait shared among three breeds – Rhodesian Ridgeback, Thai Ridgeback, and Phu Quoc Ridgeback. Phu Quoc Ridgebacks are known for being incredibly agile, swift, and resilient. They are excellent hunters and traditionally assisted local fishermen by catching fish and defending their catches from theft. These dogs are said to have a keen sense of smell, which makes them excellent trackers. They are intelligent, independent, and loyal to their owners but can be reserved to strangers. Mudi: The Mudi, on the other hand, originates from Hungary and is a herding dog used for various tasks, including herding livestock, protecting property, and providing companionship. First officially recognized in the 1930s, the Mudi is relatively rare compared to other well-known Hungarian breeds like the Puli and the Komondor. The Mudi is a medium-sized dog with a sporty and robust build. They have moderately long, wavy to curly coats that require minimal grooming. Coat colors can vary from white, black, gray, brown, yellow, or a mix known as \\"blue merle.\\" Mudi have a distinct appearance, characterized by their pointy ears, which stand upright and give them an alert and focused expression. These dogs are highly intelligent, versatile, and adaptable, making them suitable for numerous dog sports and activities like agility, obedience, and search and rescue. Mudis are loyal and loving with their families, and their high intelligence makes them quick learners that thrive on mental and physical stimulation. However, they can be reserved with strangers and may exhibit a strong guarding instinct. In conclusion, both the Phu Quoc Ridgeback and the Mudi are dog breeds with unique characteristics and qualities, stemming from their geographical origins and roles in their respective societies. Despite their differences, their shared canine lineage unites them. Each breed possesses its distinct charm that appeals to dog lovers from all walks of life, and both can make excellent companions when given appropriate care, training, and socialization."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A woman sitting in a seat with a hat on singing.\\" if \\"the women is homeless trying to get some money by singing\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A woman sitting in a seat with a hat on singing,\\" is a description of a scene, where the focus is on the physical setup and the activity being performed by the woman. It describes the woman's appearance, her position (sitting), the presence of a hat, and the action she is engaged in (singing). On the other hand, the information that \\"the woman is homeless trying to get some money by singing\\" provides context and motivation behind her actions. The woman's homeless status indicates her socioeconomic situation, and her objective of trying to get some money explains the reason why she is singing. It is possible that she is using the hat as a receptacle for passers-by to drop money into, as a form of street performance to attract attention and collect donations. Given the second piece of information and with additional context, we can conclude that there is a connection between the two statements. The woman, who is described as sitting in a seat with a hat on and singing, is the same woman who is homeless and trying to get some money by singing. Her position and actions make sense in the context of her situation, as singing while seated may help her create a more visible presence on the street, while the presence of a hat can serve as a makeshift container for collecting money from people who choose to donate to her. However, it is important to note that, by themselves, the two statements do not explicitly imply each other. Without additional context, it might not be immediately clear that the woman's act of singing while seated with a hat on is a result of her homelessness or a means to obtain money. The scene might also be interpreted in different ways, such as a casual performance or practice session. Therefore, while it is possible to conclude that the two statements are related given further context, it would not be necessarily accurate to assume that one statement implies the other without additional information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Questions About Organic Produce and Sustainability Growers here on the Baja Peninsula, the epicenter of Mexico’s thriving new organic export sector, describe their toil amid the cactuses as “planting the beach.” Del Cabo Cooperative, a supplier here for Trader Joe’s and Fairway, is sending more than seven and a half tons of tomatoes and basil every day to the United States by truck and plane to sate the American demand for organic produce year-round. But even as more Americans buy foods with the organic label, the products are increasingly removed from the traditional organic ideal: produce that is not only free of chemicals and pesticides but also grown locally on small farms in a way that protects the environment. The explosive growth in the commercial cultivation of organic tomatoes here, for example, is putting stress on the water table. In some areas, wells have run dry this year, meaning that small subsistence farmers cannot grow crops. And the organic tomatoes end up in an energy-intensive global distribution chain that takes them as far as New York and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, producing significant emissions that contribute to global warming. From now until spring, farms from Mexico to Chile to Argentina that grow organic food for the United States market are enjoying their busiest season. “People are now buying from a global commodity market, and they have to be skeptical even when the label says ‘organic’ — that doesn’t tell people all they need to know,” said Frederick L. Kirschenmann, a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University. He said some large farms that have qualified as organic employed environmentally damaging practices, like planting only one crop, which is bad for soil health, or overtaxing local freshwater supplies. Many growers and even environmental groups in Mexico defend the export-driven organic farming, even as they acknowledge that more than a third of the aquifers in southern Baja are categorized as overexploited by the Mexican water authority. With sophisticated irrigation systems and shade houses, they say, farmers are becoming more skilled at conserving water. They are focusing new farms in “microclimates” near underexploited aquifers, such as in the shadow of a mountain, said Fernando Frías, a water specialist with the environmental group Pronatura Noroeste. They also point out that the organic business has transformed what was once a poor area of subsistence farms and where even the low-paying jobs in the tourist hotels and restaurants in nearby Cabo San Lucas have become scarcer during the recession. To carry the Agriculture Department’s organic label on their produce, farms in the United States and abroad must comply with a long list of standards that prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers, hormones and pesticides, for example. But the checklist makes few specific demands for what would broadly be called environmental sustainability, even though the 1990 law that created the standards was intended to promote ecological balance and biodiversity as well as soil and water health. Experts agree that in general organic farms tend to be less damaging to the environment than conventional farms. In the past, however, “organic agriculture used to be sustainable agriculture, but now that is not always the case,” said Michael Bomford, a scientist at Kentucky State University who specializes in sustainable agriculture. He added that intense organic agriculture had also put stress on aquifers in California. Some organic standard setters are beginning to refine their criteria so that organic products better match their natural ideals. Krav, a major Swedish organic certification program, allows produce grown in greenhouses to carry its “organic” label only if the buildings use at least 80 percent renewable fuel, for example. And last year the Agriculture Department’s National Organic Standards Board revised its rules to require that for an “organic milk” label, cows had to be at least partly fed by grazing in open pastures rather than standing full time in feedlots. But each decision to narrow the definition of “organic” involves an inevitable tug-of-war among farmers, food producers, supermarkets and environmentalists. While the United States’ regulations for organic certification require that growers use practices that protect water resources, it is hard to define a specific sustainable level of water use for a single farm “because aquifer depletion is the result of many farmers’ overutilizing the resource,” said Miles McEvoy, head of the National Organic Program at the Agriculture Department. While the original organic ideal was to eat only local, seasonal produce, shoppers who buy their organics at supermarkets, from Whole Foods to Walmart, expect to find tomatoes in December and are very sensitive to price. Both factors stoke the demand for imports. Few areas in the United States can farm organic produce in the winter without resorting to energy-guzzling hothouses. In addition, American labor costs are high. Day laborers who come to pick tomatoes in this part of Baja make about 10 a day, nearly twice the local minimum wage. Tomato pickers in Florida may earn 80 a day in high season. Manuel Verdugo, 42, began organic tomato farming on desert land in San José del Cabo five years ago and now owns 30 acres in several locations. Each week he sends two and a half tons of cherry, plum and beefsteak tomatoes to the United States under the brand name Tiky Cabo. He has invested in irrigation systems that drip water directly onto plants’ roots rather than channeling it through open canals. He is building large shade houses that cover his crops to keep out pests and minimize evaporation. Even so, he cannot farm 10 acres in the nearby hamlet of La Cuenca because the wells there are dry. At another five-year-old organic farm, Rosario Castillo says he can cultivate only 19 acres of the 100 he has earmarked for organic production, although he dug a well seven months ago to gain better access to the aquifer. The authorities ration pumping and have not granted him permission to clear native cactuses. “We have very little water here, and you have to go through a lot of bureaucracy to get it,” Mr. Castillo said. Many growers blame tourist development — hotels and golf courses — for the water scarcity, and this has been a major problem in coastal areas. But farming can also be a significant drain. According to one study in an area of northern Baja called Ojos Negros, a boom in the planting of green onions for export a decade ago lowered the water table by about 16 inches a year. “They were pumping a lot of groundwater, and that was making some people rich on both sides of the border at the expense of the environment,” said Victor Miguel Ponce, a professor of hydrology at San Diego State University. The logistics of getting water and transporting large volumes of perishable produce favors bigger producers. Some of the largest are American-owned, like Sueño Tropical, a vast farm with rows of shade houses lined up in the desert that caters exclusively to the American market. While traditional organic farmers saw a blemish or odd shape simply as nature’s variations, workers at Sueño Tropical are instructed to cull tomatoes that do not meet the uniform shape, size and cosmetic requirement of clients like Whole Foods. Those “seconds” are sold locally. Yet the connection to the United States has brought other kinds of benefits. Del Cabo Cooperative, which serves as a broker for hundreds of local farmers, provides seeds for its Mexican growers and hires roving agronomists and entomologists to assist them in tending their crops without chemicals. As the American market expands, said John Graham, a coordinator of operations at Del Cabo, he is always looking to bring new growers into his network — especially those whose farms draw on distant aquifers where water is still abundant.","completion":"The booming organic food export industry in Mexico is contributing to water scarcity and an energy-intensive global distribution chain. The commercial cultivation of organic tomatoes is causing particular strain on the water table, leading to dry wells in some areas. Organic foods, which were once always considered sustainable, are now putting stress on aquifers, with intense organic agriculture causing issues in countries like the US as well. Mexican farmers provide large amounts of organic food to the US, but the environmental impact, including transportation and water usage, detracts from their original sustainable goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Northern Ireland Moves Towards Banning Smoking in Cars with Child Passengers Introduction The dangers of secondhand smoke have long been established and understood by the general public. However, despite the knowledge of these dangers, smoking in vehicles with children as passengers continues to occur. In an effort to protect the health and well-being of children, Northern Ireland is moving closer to banning smoking in cars while youngsters are on board. Background on Secondhand Smoke Secondhand smoke, also called passive smoke or environmental tobacco smoke, is a dangerous mixture of more than 4,000 chemicals produced by a burning tobacco product. These chemicals are classified as toxic and cancer-causing agents. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to secondhand smoke causes approximately 600,000 premature deaths globally every year. Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke due to their developing respiratory systems. In comparison to adults, children breathe in more air relative to their body weight, leading to a greater intake of pollutants. According to the American Lung Association, secondhand smoke is a known cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks in children. Banning Smoking in Cars with Children: A Global Movement Countries around the world have already proposed and enacted legislation to protect children from exposure to secondhand smoke in vehicles. For example, in 2002, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador became the first place to implement such a ban. Since then, other provinces in Canada, as well as countries including Australia, France, England, and Wales, have instituted similar legislation. The Proposal in Northern Ireland Northern Ireland is now on the verge of joining this growing list of countries that are addressing the problem of smoking in cars with child passengers. The proposed ban on smoking in cars carrying passengers aged 18 or under has been under discussion and review in Northern Ireland’s Assembly. It is expected that the legislation will be introduced, debated, and enacted in the near future. The legislation aims to protect the health and welfare of children when they are passengers in vehicles. It acknowledges the heightened vulnerability of young people to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and reflects the growing concern in society about the public health implications of smoking around children. Public Reaction and Enforcement The proposal has generally been met with widespread public support, as more people recognize the dangers of exposing children to secondhand smoke. However, opponents argue that the ban may be difficult to enforce and might infringe on the personal liberties of those who smoke. Nevertheless, the ban on smoking in cars with children present aligns with Northern Ireland's broader anti-smoking initiatives. Various methods may be employed to enforce compliance with the legislation, such as fines for drivers caught smoking with a child in the vehicle or signage within the car to remind drivers and passengers of the law. Conclusion The proposed ban on smoking in cars with children passengers in Northern Ireland aligns with the growing global movement to protect vulnerable populations from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure. Legislation such as this demonstrates a commitment to public health by governments and represents a step forward in safeguarding the wellbeing of children. With time and sustained efforts, it is hoped that the exposure of children to secondhand smoke in cars and other confined spaces will become a phenomenon of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mark and his sister Elaine recently had a visit with their doctors to see how their health was doing. Mark has not been able to manage his weight for the last several years, and the doctor told him he now officially has type 2 diabetes. Elaine has paid close attention to her health, and the doctor told her she does not have type 2 diabetes and her health is normal. Hint: Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can’t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before.

Most businesses would hate to see their customers running out their doors, but in one suburban strip mall near Denver, Colorado, they are chasing the customers away -- with a chainsaw. \\"We're 'hauntrepreneurs,' we like to do things that are just a little bit different,\\" says KathE Walker, who owns four haunted houses in the Denver area. \\"It's really exciting because you know you've done a good job,\\" Walker says. \\"If they are running out screaming, then the actors have done their jobs, everybody has had a good time because they want to be scared. That's why they come. \\"If they're not scared, they won't come back.\\" KathE Walker -- the capital E isn't a typo, \\"it's a '60s thing,\\" she says -- laughs a lot for a woman in the business of scaring her customers. Walker, 59, runs her haunts with her husband and two grown sons. They spend the rest of the year making props for other haunted houses around the country and they throw a big science fiction convention each spring. Despite the tough economy, Walker says, business is good. She anticipates a total of 40,000-50,000 visitors, each paying 14.95 to get scared. She employs about 175 people for the Halloween season. Three of her haunts are in unused storefronts in suburban strip malls and a fourth operates out of trailers in a field near a state park. Visitors are also asked to contribute a can of food for a local food bank. Larry Kirchner, president of the Haunted House Association, says business is booming across the country for seasonal frightfests. The association says there are 2,000 for-profit haunts across the country, plus another 1,000 houses run for charity. Around 20 million fright-seekers will pay an average of 15 a visit this Halloween season, according to the group. That's a surprising figure to some in these lean economic times. \\"We feel very fortunate,\\" Walker says. \\"I know that the economy is very scary for a lot of people. The people that we aim the haunted houses at are kids in high school and college, kids that have a lot more disposable income. They're still living with their parents. \\"We don't draw a lot of people that are desperate to make their mortgages. ... It's great date-night stuff. Guys love bringing their girlfriends here, they're holding onto them. It's fun.\\" It's fun for Walker, too. While giving a tour of Slaughterhouse Gulch, which features a series of movie monsters, she giggles as a cluster of date-night teenagers scream and run from Leatherface, the villain from the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" films. \\"You make some money, obviously that's why you keep doing it,\\" she says. \\"But for the most part we put a lot of money back into the haunted house so we can keep making them bigger and better. ... It can be kind of expensive. You cross your fingers each year hoping people will come.\\" Walker says she loves the challenge of scaring people. \\"Some people come in and they say 'Oh you can't scare me,' \\" she says. \\"And they all end up running out of here, just terrified.\\" So what scares Walker? \\"Clowns. I hate clowns. It took me a long time to finally let clowns be in the haunted house.\\" 'Scaring people is really fun' Walker staffs her haunted houses with teens and 20-somethings who seem to have as much fun as the patrons. In the makeup room, Chris Parish is getting ready for his first day on the job. He'll be playing the guy chained in the bathtub from the movie \\"Saw.\\" \\"Today is my first day scheduled, so I actually get to get paid for scaring people,\\" he says. \\"Scaring people is really fun and it's something that I love to do.\\" Halloween is makeup artist Michael Garvin's favorite time of year. He was laid off in July and hasn't been able to find another job, but during October he works days at a costume shop and nights making up the 35-40 actors who fill two of Walker's haunts. \\"When I was really young I fell in love with Halloween and then horror movies,\\" he said. \\"I love this. I'd do this just for the fun of it, but the paycheck at the end of the month is a good thing.\\" Caity Strother is 18 and has had trouble finding a job. It's her second year working in Slaughterhouse Gulch, where she specializes in portraying an undead ghoul. \\"I've filled out probably 50 applications in the last two months and gotten maybe four calls back,\\" she said.

Here is an article: Coming into the final stretch of Season 6 of The Good Wife, \\"Loser Edit\\" felt like a slower-paced episode in the midst of a season that has been full of adrenaline and conspiracy. Yet once the hour concluded, so many things had been set into motion that it was clear the action is nowhere near slowing down. Yet again, Alicia's storyline doesn't feel like the central story — not just because it's not any more compelling than the other characters', but because for only the second or third time this season she isn't getting the majority of the screen time. The illicit emails from last week's FLG hack come back to haunt Alicia. A reporter has received the emails and will take the story public. Eli's plan is, of course, to spin the emails before they're released: Alicia must deny that she had a physical affair, and say that the emails were the product of an office flirtation. The episode opens with Alicia's antagonistic reporter sitting in an edit room cutting the footage of their interview, which starts as a puff piece. We watch the colors of the piece flip as the story spins in a different direction after the emails come to light. During Alicia's campaign, episode after episode focused on the importance of perception, and the difference between what we believe and what the truth is. Alicia's campaign may be over, but she won't be able to leave politics behind her. The episode's closer is the airing of the reporter's story: Instead of the emails, she attacks Alicia with the accusation that she cheated at the polls. This is a crisis for which team Alicia was not prepared. Alicia isn't the only one with an old ghost resurfacing in this episode. The evidence Kalinda faked to prove Carey's innocence has come back to haunt them in the form of the investigator Andrew Wiley. It only takes a couple loose threads for the entire story to unravel, and Wiley finds them and pulls them (with two leashed kids in tow). It's a catastrophic situation, not just for Kalinda, but also for Diane, who could be disbarred for her participation in the fraud. This episode was jam-packed — we haven't even gotten to the C-plot involving Diane and her conservative client Reese Dipple. This was much more \\"case-of-the-week\\" driven than Alicia and Kalinda's stories, but in many ways it was the most satisfying, with Diane getting to stretch her muscles in a hypothetical lawsuit involving gay marriage. \\"The law is supposed to be fair,\\" she tells Dipple when he accuses her of manipulating him by casting his gay nephew as her plaintiff. \\"That doesn't mean it's not supposed to be personal.\\" Things have gotten very personal for Alicia as she's sought the office of State's Attorney, and for Kalinda as she tried desperately to save Carey from paying for a crime he didn't commit. Alicia and Kalinda both strayed from their moral code in their pursuit of a nobler aim, Alicia by lying about her affair with Will and Kalinda by faking evidence. There may not be enough distance for the two of them to outrun their demons, which are drawing closer as we approach the end of Season 6. Have something to add to this story?

The team performed better in the gym than on the field because it was slippery on the","completion":"field, which affected their overall performance, whereas the gym provided a more stable and controlled environment, allowing them to showcase their true capabilities. Firstly, the slippery field conditions posed by wet grass and muddy surfaces could significantly impact the team's ability to execute key maneuvers and maintain their footing. Due to the unpredictable and difficult nature of these conditions, players may have struggled to maintain their balance, speed, and agility, all of which are essential components in achieving peak performance. Slips and falls can lead not only to reduced efficiency during gameplay but can also raise the risk of injury among the team members, discouraging them from giving their all to their game. Consequently, the field conditions were a major impediment to the team's ability to demonstrate their full potential during the match. In contrast, the gym offered an even, dry, and stable surface that enabled the players to execute their movements with greater precision and confidence. The consistent conditions, free from potential hazards found on the slippery field, ensured that the players could invest their entire focus on their gameplay and strategies. This environment encouraged them to push their limits, knowing they would not be hindered by the challenges associated with unpredictable outdoor conditions. Moreover, the indoor environment of the gym may have aided temperature regulation and provided protection from the wind, rain, and other external weather factors that would have further contributed to the team's diminished performance on the field. Additionally, the nature of the gym facilitated a more structured practice and training regimen, which could have contributed to the team's enhanced performance. The availability of specialized equipment and resources that are typically found within a gym setting would have allowed the team to follow a well-rounded exercise program targeting specific muscle groups and skillsets. The systematic approach enabled by the gym environment would have fostered a higher level of teamwork, discipline, and focus within the group, translating into a more cohesive and effective performance during the actual game. In conclusion, the team's superior performance in the gym, as compared to the field, can be attributed to the unfavorable and unpredictable conditions presented by the slippery field, which hindered their gameplay and posed risks to their safety. Conversely, the stable and consistent environment provided by the gym facilitated not only a heightened level of performance but also allowed for targeted training and skill development. As a result, the team thrived under the more controlled conditions of the gym, showcasing their best abilities and true potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Unfortunately, the experience was far from satisfactory. To begin with, the service was incredibly slow. It took ages for our orders to be taken, and even longer for the food to arrive. We were starving and frustrated by the time we finally got our meals. Once the food arrived, we hoped that the taste would at least make up for the wait. However, the taste was a huge letdown. The dishes lacked seasoning and were bland, and it was apparent that the chef wasn't using fresh ingredients. Furthermore, the portion sizes were quite small, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. To make matters worse, the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was appalling. The tablecloth was stained, the silverware had remnants of previous meals, and the floor seemed like it hadn't been swept in days. This did not help with our appetite and made us question the hygiene standards in the kitchen. On top of all this, the staff didn't seem to care about the guests. The waiter was unfriendly and barely interacted with us, making us feel like an inconvenience. The price we paid for this subpar experience was way too high and not worth it. In conclusion, I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant. There are many more dining options nearby that prove to be more enjoyable and worth the money. Save yourself the disappointment – skip this place.

The first sensible lesson is that you shouldn't bother trying to find your way in the dark at all, but just stay put until dawn. Because then you won't trip over things? No, mainly because you'll have an idea of direction. The sun rises in the east. But you will be amazed at how many people forget they know that. Apparently, the area underneath a holly bush provides a good makeshift shelter -- they are thick, and evergreen. The next thing to do -- or rather not to do -- is panic, for the obvious reason that unless there is someone there to hear you scream, it will get you nowhere. Just try to think of nice, happy things. There is always a point in films when a person who is lost in the desert or the snow, dehydrated and exhausted, comes across a set of their own footprints and realizes they have just walked in a huge, round circle. It is wrong to owe it to the unequal strengths or different lengths of your legs. Experiments prove that, without the sun or the moon (or landmarks) as a fixed guide, lots of small errors add up over time so the brain can't correctly identify the \\"straight ahead\\" direction. To just get out of somewhere, pick a spot on the horizon and just head for it. There are several ways to find directions in the dark, and by far the best is to establish north using the stars. Most people can identify the Plough, which is part of Ursa Major. It looks a lot like a saucepan. The Plough rotates through the sky, but let's imagine the saucepan lying horizontally , with its handle on the left. You need to trace a line from the star at the right-hand base of the pan, through the star at the right-hand rim , and follow it upwards; the north star is roughly five times the distance between those two \\"pointer\\" stars. Then drop a vertical line from the North Star to the horizon and that's north. \\"Tonight is very cloudy and I can't see the Plough.\\" Maybe luckily, it is quite windy. Keep in mind that almost all of our weather comes from a... Question: Why will people often walk in a circle if they are lost in the desert or the snow?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. in fungi the individual filaments of the body are called??","completion":"In fungi, the individual filaments that make up the body are called hyphae (singular: hypha). Hyphae are long, thin, thread-like structures composed of fungal cells, and are responsible for growth, nutrient absorption, and reproduction in fungi. Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that belong to the kingdom Fungi. They are heterotrophic, meaning they obtain their nutrition by breaking down and absorbing nutrients from other organic materials. Fungi can be found in various forms, such as multicellular molds or single-celled yeasts, but all fungi share the common feature of having hyphae as their basic structural and functional units. The hyphae grow and branch out to form an extensive network called a mycelium, which is the main vegetative part of a fungus. The mycelium can be found in various environments such as soil, decaying plant materials, or within living organisms as parasites. The hyphae produce enzymes that break down complex organic substances like cellulose, lignin, and pectin, into simpler compounds that the fungi can absorb and utilize for their growth and development. Hyphae can be classified into two types: septate and aseptate (or coenocytic). 1. Septate hyphae: These are hyphae that possess crosswalls, or septa, which divide the hypha into separate compartments. Each compartment contains one or more nuclei. These septa allow for compartmentalization and can help prevent the spreading of cellular damage or protect the hyphae from harmful substances. Septate hyphae are common in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. 2. Aseptate (coenocytic) hyphae: In this type of hyphae, there are either no septa or very few of them, resulting in a continuous, multinucleate cytoplasm within a single hyphal filament. Aseptate hyphae are common in the phylum Zygomycota. Hyphae play a crucial role in sexual and asexual reproduction in fungi. During asexual reproduction, structures called conidiophores or sporangia are formed at the tips of specialized hyphae. These reproductive structures produce spores that are released and dispersed into the environment to give rise to new fungal colonies. In sexual reproduction, hyphae from two different mating types fuse together, resulting in the formation of specialized reproductive structures such as fruiting bodies, where sexual spores are produced. In summary, hyphae are the individual filaments that make up the body of fungi. They serve essential roles in growth, nutrient absorption, and reproduction, and are found in both septate and aseptate forms. By branching out into intricate mycelial networks, hyphae enable fungi to explore their habitats, break down and absorb nutrients, and interact with other organisms in various ecosystems."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Malva parviflora - Malva parviflora is an annual or perennial herb that is native to Northern Africa Europe and Asia and is widely naturalised elsewhere.

Make this lower case.","completion":"The text from the given book and verse, when translated into lowercase, reads as follows: \\"and all the people rose up as one man, saying, we will not any one go to his tent, neither will we any one turn into his house.\\" This passage highlights a significant moment of unison and concerted resolve among the people. Their unanimous decision not to return to their homes or their tents signifies their commitment to the collective cause. This act underscores the gravity of their decision and the strong sense of community and solidarity that prevails among them. Whether read in lowercase or uppercase, the message of this segment remains clear and impactful. It encapsulates a significant event where people standing together as one voice and deciding not to return to the comforts of their personal homes showcases their unity and shared determination. Lowercase texts are more readable and are recommended for use in most written materials. The primary reason behind this recommendation is that people are accustomed to reading in lowercase. Our eyes have adapted to recognize the shapes of clusters of lowercase letters (also known as bouma shape), which help us to read more quickly and efficiently. Uppercase letters, on the other hand, take up more space visually, which can slow reading speed. They are primarily used for emphasis, titles, or to suggest loudness. In this context, the lowercase variant preserves the impactful message of unity and solidarity within the populace, while maintaining readability and a subtle tone. In conclusion, the lowercase version of the passage is: \\"and all the people rose up as one man, saying, we will not any one go to his tent, neither will we any one turn into his house.\\" The transformation does not take away from the message, potency, and significance of the script, but instead enhances its readability and interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kurzum: Machthaber müssen ihren Ruf als verlässliche und aufrichtige Menschen kultivieren – eine Lektion, die der russische Präsident Wladimir Putin eindeutig nicht beherzigt hat. Translate to English English:","completion":"In short, rulers must cultivate their reputation as reliable and honest individuals - a lesson that Russian President Vladimir Putin has clearly not taken to heart. A more detailed explanation: This statement highlights the importance of political leaders building and maintaining a positive image in the eyes of their constituents and the international community. A strong reputation as a reliable and honest individual is essential for any leader to establish credibility, trust, and respect from others. Leaders who are seen as trustworthy and forthright are more likely to successfully negotiate with other countries, carry out their policy agenda, and avoid internal and external conflict. In the case of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the statement suggests that he has not embraced this lesson, as he is frequently criticized for his actions and policies that are seen as manipulative, dishonest, or aggressive both domestically and internationally. Accusations of electoral interference, diminished political freedoms, and the annexation of Crimea are just a few examples that have tarnished Putin's reputation on the global stage. By not embracing the importance of cultivating a trustworthy and honest reputation, President Putin may experience challenges in effectively governing Russia and managing its relationships with other nations. This failure to adhere to the principles of transparency, honesty, and reliability could result in consequences that negatively impact Russia and its people in the long run. A leader who does not prioritize these qualities in their leadership may struggle to win cooperation from other governments and may ultimately be seen as an untrustworthy player in international affairs. This can lead to isolation and diminished influence on the global stage. Additionally, a dishonest and unreliable leader can create an environment of mistrust and disloyalty, which can have detrimental effects on the stability and long-term success of a nation's political system and its citizenry. Therefore, the importance of political leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, embracing the lesson of cultivating a reputation as reliable and honest individuals cannot be overstated. Doing so will not only contribute to successful governance domestically but also pave the way for more fruitful relationships and cooperation on the international stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Frasier Winslow Crane is a fictional character on the American television sitcoms Cheers and Frasier, portrayed by Kelsey Grammer. Grammer received award recognitions for portraying this character in these two shows, in addition to a 1992 one-time appearance in Wings. The character debuts in the Cheers third-season premiere, \\"Rebound (Part 1)\\" (1984), as Diane Chambers's love interest, part of the Sam and Diane story arc. Intended to appear for only a few episodes, Grammer's performance for the role was praised by producers, prompting them to expand his role and to increase his prominence. Context: During the course of the spin-off's run, especially in scenes at Frasier's apartment, Frasier and Martin regularly argue over the living arrangements and each other's personalities: Frasier is sophisticated, intellectual, and erudite, while Martin is a rugged man of simple tastes who speaks (according to Frasier) in words that no \\"sophisticated, educated\\" person could understand. While Frasier has many common interests with Niles and shares adventures (or misadventures) with him, he has little in common with his father, Martin. In \\"Dinner at Eight\\" (1993), Martin takes Frasier and Niles to a themed steakhouse, where health-conscious, snobby Frasier and Niles criticize the food, the restaurant's customs, and the clientele. Martin becomes frustrated and angry before leaving, remarking upon departing that their mother, Hester, would be disappointed with their behavior. Frasier and Niles try to prove that they are not \\"snobs\\" by finishing their meal, although it takes them until after closing time. Ironically, in the Cheers season seven episode, \\"I Kid You Not\\" (1988), Frasier invites Carla and her son Ludlow to the upper class, expensive restaurant, but Carla and Ludlow criticize and mock it, enraging Frasier. In \\"Chess Pains\\", Frasier teaches Martin how to play chess, but is horrified when Martin becomes a better player than him, due to Martin's seasoned insight as a police detective. Frasier becomes obsessed with winning against his father until Frasier wins one match and Martin does not want to play with Frasier anymore. One late night, Frasier wakes Martin up and asks him whether he lost the chess match on purpose. Martin responds that Frasier \\"won, fair and square\\" and nothing more. In an episode of the seventh season \\"A Tsar Is Born\\" (1999), Martin takes an old family clock, which Frasier and Niles consider hideous, to exhibit on the television show Antiques Roadshow. As the boys soon discover, the clock is related to their ancestors and royalty, and may be worth a fortune, and heightens their expectations of being descended from royalty. Unfortunately, when they try to sell the clock later, the brothers learn from an antique specialist that it was stolen from the daughter of Tsar Alexander II. Moreover, their great-great-grandmother was discovered to have been the clock thief and the daughter's scullery maid, and is discovered to have later been a prostitute in New York City. Therefore, the brothers are left without a fortune, a clock, and their royal dreams are crushed, as Frasier puts it, they are descended from \\"thieves and whores\\". Much to their anger, Martin buys a Winnebago RV with money Frasier claimed were the proceeds from selling the clock. Actress Bebe Neuwirth left Cheers for fear of becoming typecast and to do theatre (mostly Broadway); she did not expect to appear recurrently in Frasier. Cheers and Frasier writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs found chemistry of Frasier and Lilith \\"special\\" enough to compare them with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy on Prozac. In \\"The Show Where Lilith Comes Back\\" (1994), Lilith surprises Frasier by dialing to the radio show. They later make love in a hotel room, but end up regretting it, prompting them to part ways again. They decide to remain friends and help each other raise their son Frederick (Trevor Einhorn), who also appears occasionally in this spin-off. In \\"Adventures in Paradise, Part Two\\" (1994), Lilith gets engaged to her fiance Brian (James Morrison), much to Frasier's dismay. In \\"A Lilith Thanksgiving\\" (1996), Frasier and Lilith have Frederick admitted into a private school after they annoy the administrator (Paxton Whitehead) several times on Thanksgiving. In \\"The Unnatural\\" (1997), Frasier is proven as unathletic and bad at softball, which he reluctantly admits to Frederick. Then Frasier tells him that, when Frasier was a third-grade elementary student, Martin was bad at math. Much of the intellectual jousting with Lilith that sits alongside the narrative of post-divorce navigation hinges on the fact that in psychological terms Lilith is a behaviorist whereas Frasier is a psychoanalyst. In \\"Room Service\\" (1998), Lilith is recently divorced from her husband Brian for his gay affair. Frasier attempts to renew the relationship, but changes his mind when he finds out, to his horror, that Lilith and Niles had a drunken one-night stand. Lilith last appears in \\"Guns 'N Neuroses\\" (2003), in which she Frasier are accidentally set up to go on a blind date. Lilith and Frasier are close to restarting a relationship in the hotel room, but they are interrupted by a loud argument between a young married couple next door. Frasier and Lilith are able to resolve the couple's dispute, spend the night together watching television, and finally fall asleep on the couch without intimacy. The next morning, they part ways at their final onscreen moment together. Question: What else happens in the reunion episode? Answer:","completion":"In the reunion episode, Frasier and his ex-wife Lilith come back together for a special event or situation. They might have some funny and awkward moments as they spend time together, but they also remember the good times they had in the past. They realize that even though their relationship didn't work out, they can still be friends and support each other in raising their son, Frederick. At the end of the episode, they say goodbye and go their separate ways, but with a better understanding of each other and their shared history."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world. However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. \\"Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,\\" says Martine. \\"They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package.\\" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. \\"This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,\\" says Martine.

Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Jumping on elevated platforms such as trampolines can be great for jogging as well.; (B). To burn at least 300 calories in a half an hour, you have to jog or run. Aim for your pace to be around a 10-minute mile or 6 mph (if you're on the treadmill).; (C). The less muscles your perform, the lower your overall overall calorie burn will be (essentially, more calories) and the further your total calorie intake will go. You can use additional weights if you prefer the level of impact.; (D). For optimal results, hop on a treadmill and run for at least a 30 minute mile (16 km).

You know how some places have places to run or even bouncy trampolines? Those are called gyms. They're like playgrounds for adults where they go to use their energy. So one thing we could do is find a gym. (B). To use up lots of energy, we need to move really quick. Imagine you're chasing a bunny - you try to keep up that speed for 30 minutes. That's like running pretty fast, but not as fast as a race. (C). The more parts of your body you move, the more energy you use. It's like if you had to pick up toys. If you only used one hand, it would take longer. But if you used both hands and your feet, you'd finish quicker. So while jogging, you can also carry little weights to use more energy. (D). Now, imagine you have a toy treadmill, like a moving sidewalk. If you jog on it for 30 minutes, you'll use lots of energy. That's moderate activity, meaning it's not too easy and not too hard.

I do know who Rachael Ray is because I’ve seen her on TV and on the covers of some of her 18 books. What always struck me about her was her overwhelmingly buoyant personality, always on display as she whips things up in her kitchen on the tube. The Rachael Ray who called me last week, though, was a very unhappy, annoyed Rachael Ray. The object of her upset: The New York Times. The cover of the March 14 Dining section carried a boldly-illustrated feature headlined, “I Was a Cookbook Ghostwriter.” The sub-headline said, “Finding the words chefs wish they had.” The reporter, Julia Moskin, started the piece off with a recollection of her days ghosting nine cookbooks. The story then went on to wonder how prodigious cookbook authors like Rachael Ray manage “cookbook production schedules that boggle the mind.” “How, you might ask, do they do it?” the piece asked, then followed with: “The answer: they don’t.” Enter Rachael Ray: “I wrote all my books. I have them in handwritten and digital form,” she told me, and added: “You tell me what part of that makes me not the writer.” Also appearing in the article was Gwyneth Paltrow, a picture of whom carried a caption that said her ghostwriter is Julia Turshen. Like Ms. Ray, Ms. Paltrow took to Twitter to complain: Love @nytimes dining section but this weeks facts need checking. No ghost writer on my cookbook, I wrote every word myself. — Gwyneth Paltrow (@GwynethPaltrow) March 17, 2012 Ms. Paltrow’s publicist, Stephen Huvane, told me that Ms. Paltrow strongly disputes The Times’s account. “Gwyneth is very very upset with the times and rightfully so,” he wrote in an email. “She did NOT use a ghost writer. Julia Turshen was her assistant during the writing of that book and is appropriately acknowledged. Every word of that book was written by Gwyneth. Every recipe of that book was written and developed by Gwyneth.” But The Times has refused to correct the article. I queried Susan Edgerley, editor of the section, and she told me the article “did not say someone else wrote Rachael Ray’s or Gwyneth Paltrow’s books. We said they, like many others, had help.” Ms. Edgerley referred me to a passage in the article that, she indicated, let readers know how the article was defining ghostwriting: Food ghostwriters come in many different flavors, including the researchers who might spend days testing every possible method of cooking beans for Bobby Flay, the aproned assistants at the Food Network who frantically document everything that the “talent” does on camera in order to produce recipes for the Web site, and the (slightly) more literary work of writers who attempt to document a chef’s ideas, memories and vision in glossy cookbooks. And Richard L. Berke, the assistant managing editor who oversees features sections, added, “The article clearly touched a nerve with Ms. Ray and others, but we believe it was utterly fair and accurate.” So who is right here? To me, it comes down to how you define ghostwriting. The everyday definition, and the one I would use, is that a ghostwriter is one who writes a book in the place of the author of record. But The Times, as is evident in the passage above, was using a stretched version of the term (add water and stir). Further complicating things, the article rolled right through the section about Ms. Ray before offering up the caveat of a broader definition for ghosting cookbooks. For a reader (and for Ms. Ray), it certainly seemed to be saying, flat-out, she doesn’t write her own books. Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"Rachael Ray and Gwyneth Paltrow Defend Their Cookbook Authorship Amid Ghostwriting Controversy\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \\"fairy life\\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the...

Options: A. palace B. garden C. country estate D. large house E. suburbs Answer:","completion":"B. garden Justification: The king is described to be strolling through 'his back courtyard.' Courtyards are often associated with palaces and houses formulating a part of the property. The term 'back' suggests a proximity to the king's residential place. Among the options, 'palace' would make the most sense as it is typically where a king resides. However, 'back courtyard' suggests an outdoor space which logically could include a garden, making 'garden' the more fitting answer. 'Country estate' could be a possibility, but it's much more ambiguous, since estates can be far-flung and not necessarily close to the king. 'Large house' might be a potential answer but would not be as typical a residence for a king as a palace. 'Suburbs' is quite unlikely as they denote a residential area, often some distance from the central part of the city, and it is unlikely that a king's palace is situated in such an area.

It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating these vocalizations are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

Q: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. South Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (nee Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for Getty Oil. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan. His father is of mostly Irish descent; one of Newsom's maternal great-grandfathers, Scotsman Thomas Addis, was a pioneer scientist in the field of nephrology and a professor of medicine at Stanford University. Newsom is the second cousin, twice removed, of musician Joanna Newsom. As mayor, Newsom focused on development projects in Hunters Point and Treasure Island. He signed the Health Choices Plan in 2007 to provide San Francisco residents with universal healthcare. In 2004, Newsom gained national attention when he directed the San Francisco city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, in violation of the state law passed in 2000. Implementation of Care Not Cash began on July 1, 2004. As part of his Care Not Cash initiative, 5,000 more homeless people were given permanent shelter in the city. As of October 21, 2007, about 2,000 people have been placed into permanent housing with support. Other programs initiated by Newsom to end chronic homelessness include the San Francisco Homeless Outreach Team (SF HOT), and Project Homeless Connect (PHC). On October 27, 2004, during a strike by hotel workers on a dozen San Francisco hotels, Newsom joined UNITE HERE union members on a picket line in front of the Westin St. Francis Hotel. He vowed that the city would boycott the hotels by not sponsoring city events in any until the hotels agreed to a contract with workers. The contract dispute was settled in September 2006. In 2005, Newsom pushed for a state law to allow communities in California to create policy restricting certain breeds of dogs. He requested that then state senator Jackie Speier introduce a change to then-existing California law, which stated that counties could not target specific breeds of dog. The animal control agency under his direction created a working dog task force report that cited Denver, Colorado, as a best practice for a law in California. In 2009, Newsom came under attack for the City of San Francisco's policy of illegally harboring juvenile criminal aliens. A sanctuary city, San Francisco had long been circumventing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement by harboring or sending the aliens back to their own native countries. In 2009, Newsom received the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award along with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and three other public officials for his commitment to making healthful food and physical activity options more accessible to children and families. In 2008, he had hosted the Urban Rural Roundtable to explore ways to promote regional food development and increased access to healthy affordable food, and he secured 8 million in federal and local funds for the Better Streets program, which ensures that public health perspectives are fully integrated into urban planning processes. He signed a menu-labeling bill into law, requiring that chain restaurants print nutrition information on their menus. In 2010, Newsom was named \\"America's Most Social Mayor\\" by Samepoint, based on analysis of the social media profiles of mayors from the 100 largest cities in the United States.

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep. Go to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.

Given the question: What are the first names of the people the assistant of the operations manager is responsible for? Answer the above question based on the context below: Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

Find an active tunnel First, we need to find out where the mole is living. To do this, you should look for the fresh molehills in your yard or garden. When you find a molehill, carefully flatten it down with your hands or feet. After doing this, check back after a day or two. If the molehill pops up again, that means the mole is still using that tunnel! Now we know we've found an active tunnel. 2. Use a mole-specific trap The next step is to catch the mole using a special trap. Make sure to ask a grown-up to help you with this part because it can be a bit tricky. The grown-up should go to a store to find you a trap that is made just for catching moles. This trap will be really good at catching moles without hurting them. After getting the trap, ask the grown-up to place it in the active tunnel you found earlier. Now, wait for the mole to get caught in the trap! 3. Call a professional pest control service After the mole is caught, it's essential to be gentle and kind to the captured mole because they are just little animals that didn't mean to cause any trouble. Instead of trying to deal with the mole by yourself, ask a grown-up to call a professional pest control service. These professionals know how to handle captured moles properly and where to release them safely back into nature. And that's how you catch a mole, my little explorers! Remember to be patient, gentle, and kind to these small animals, even if they're causing a mess in our gardens. After all, they're just trying to live their lives underground. Happy mole-catching!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Translate to English English:","completion":"Millions of the community's money has been paid illegally or, as in the case of cigarette smuggling, lost from revenues. In this sentence, the speaker brings attention to the fact that a significant amount of money, amounting to millions, either has been paid illegally or has been lost due to certain illicit activities. One such activity mentioned is cigarette smuggling. Cigarette smuggling, also commonly known as tobacco smuggling or bootlegging, refers to the illegal transportation and trade of tobacco products, primarily cigarettes, which are aimed at avoiding taxation and other regulatory control measures. This illegal trade results in lost revenue for the affected community, as the smugglers do not pay taxes on the products they sell. Cigarette smuggling is a widespread, global issue, as it affects both developing and developed countries across the world. The main reason behind this illicit trade is that it often offers high profits for the smugglers. This is mainly due to the fact that through smuggling, they can avoid the heavy taxes imposed on tobacco products, as well as the restrictions on their supply, distribution, and sale. Consequently, smuggled cigarettes can be sold at a much lower price compared to the legal market, which makes them more attractive to consumers, especially those with lower incomes. Several factors contribute to the thriving business of cigarette smuggling. One of the major drivers is the discrepancy in taxes imposed on tobacco products across different countries and regions. For example, a pack of cigarettes can be significantly cheaper in one country due to lower taxes than in another country with high taxes. This creates an incentive for smugglers to acquire cigarettes in the low-tax country and transport them to the high-tax country, where they can be sold at a reduced cost while still allowing the smugglers to make a significant profit. Another factor is the high demand for such low-priced cigarettes among consumers. The attractiveness of these cheaper options has led to a significant portion of the global cigarette market being dominated by illicit products. This further exacerbates the issue, as it results in an increase in both the supply and demand for smuggled cigarettes. The consequences of cigarette smuggling are manifold. For one, it impacts the economies of the affected countries, as it results in a loss of crucial tax revenue that could have been used for funding public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Moreover, the illegal nature of this activity often leads to the involvement of organized crime groups, thereby fostering corruption, violence, and other criminal activities. Efforts to combat cigarette smuggling range from international cooperation between law enforcement authorities to the implementation of stricter regulations regarding the production, sale, and distribution of tobacco products. One important measure involves the introduction of effective tracking and tracing systems that can help authorities better monitor the movement of cigarette products, making it easier for them to identify and prosecute those involved in smuggling activities. In summary, cigarette smuggling is a complex issue that causes significant financial losses for communities through lost tax revenues. This illegal activity is driven by various factors, such as discrepancies in taxes and high consumer demand for low-priced cigarettes, and it results in negative consequences for the affected countries’ economies and public safety. To address this problem, various efforts and measures are being implemented by governments across the world, including collaboration between law enforcement agencies, the introduction of stricter regulations, and the implementation of effective tracking systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: You Bet Your Life is an American comedy quiz series that aired on both radio and television. The original and best-known version was hosted by Groucho Marx of the Marx Brothers, with announcer and assistant George Fenneman. The show debuted on ABC Radio on October 27, 1947, then moved to CBS Radio debuting October 5, 1949, before making the transition to NBC-TV and NBC Radio on October 4, 1950. Because of its simple format, it was possible to broadcast the show simultaneously on radio and television. Context: The mid-1940s was a lull in Groucho Marx's career. His radio show Blue Ribbon Town, sponsored by Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, had begun in March 1943 and had failed to catch on. Groucho left the program in June 1944, replaced by vocalist Kenny Baker until the show's end two months later. He also reluctantly appeared in two movies with brothers Chico and Harpo Marx, A Night in Casablanca and the lackluster Love Happy. During a radio appearance with Bob Hope in March 1947, Marx ad-libbed most of his performance after being forced to stand by in a waiting room for 40 minutes before going live on the air. John Guedel, the Hope program's producer, formed an idea for a quiz show and approached Marx about the subject. After initial reluctance by Marx, Guedel was able to convince him to host the program once Marx realized the quiz would be only a backdrop for his contestant interviews and the storm of ad-libbing that they would elicit. Guedel also convinced Marx to invest in 50% of the show, in part by saying that he was \\"untouchable\\" at ad-libbing, but not at following a script. As Marx and the contestants were ad-libbing, he insisted that each show be filmed and edited before release to remove the risque or less interesting material. The show for the studio audience ran longer than the broadcast version. The president of Film Craft Productions, which did the filming, cited it as the first television show filmed before a live audience as part of a lengthy essay about production procedures. Question: How was You Bet Your Life started?

Q:Question: \\"What did it form?\\" Context: \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The archipelago was formed as a result of various geological processes associated with the formation of the floor of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The caldera of the submarine volcano, which forms a seamount, had multiple high points along its rim. These high points eventually developed into the islands that make up the archipelago. During its geological history, the top of the seamount experienced various episodes of submergence and emergence. In periods of complete submergence, the limestone cap on the seamount was formed by the accumulation of marine organisms like corals and shellfish. These organisms secreted calcium carbonate to build their hard shells or external structures, which, upon their death, accumulated and eventually formed the limestone layers we see today. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that takes thousands of years to form, illustrating the lengthy span of time during which the seamount was submerged. During the Ice Ages, significant changes in global climate and sea levels caused the entire caldera to be exposed above the sea level, forming a considerably large island of approximately two hundred square miles. The exposure to weathering and erosion processes during these times further shaped the features of the archipelago, contributing to the development of distinct ecosystems and unique landscapes. Over time, as tectonic plates shifted and the ocean floor changed, the archipelago was formed. The ongoing interaction of tectonics, volcanic eruptions, and radial fissure systems contributed to the formation of the islands we see today. The complex geological history of the region has also played a significant role in the development of diverse landforms, habitats, and ecosystems across the archipelago. In summary, the archipelago was formed by high points on the rim of a submarine volcano's caldera as part of the geologic processes associated with the formation of the Atlantic Ocean floor and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The limestone cap on the seamount was formed during periods of submergence through the accumulation of marine organisms, while the Ice Ages allowed the formation of a large island due to the exposure of the entire caldera above sea level. The interplay of submergence and emergence, as well as influences of tectonic and volcanic activity, resulted in the formation of the archipelago and its distinct features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Park Si-soo A South Korean treasure hunter, who recently found a sunken Russian \\"treasure ship\\" off Ulleung Island, will host an international press conference next week to unveil what it claims to be \\"part of things that will surprise the world.\\" Shinil Group, a South Korean treasure-hunting company, said the event is planned for July 25 or 26. The location is not yet fixed. The company said details will be announced on its website ( http://donskoi.kr/main/main.php ). The Dmitrii Donskoi was said to be loaded with gold. / Courtesy of Shinil Group ||||| Divers off the South Korean island of Ulleungdo have discovered the fabled wreck of the Dmitrii Donskoi, a Russian warship that was sunk in 1905 and is rumoured to still contain 5,500 boxes of gold bars and coins said to be worth US133 billion. The badly damaged Russian Imperial Navy cruiser was located by manned submersibles at a depth of 434 metres about 1.3km off Ulleungdo on Sunday morning. The Seoul-based maritime salvage company Shinil Group has been searching for the precise site of the wreck for several years and put together a team of experts from South Korea, China, Britain and Canada for this year’s effort. Video footage released by the company shows images of extensive damage to the 5,800-tonne warship, which was scuttled after an encounter with Japanese warships in May 1905. The footage also shows cannons and deck guns encrusted with marine growth, as well as the anchor and ship’s wheel. The divers were finally able to positively identify the ship when floodlights on one of the submersibles picked out the name in Cyrillic characters on its stern. “The body of the ship was severely damaged by shelling, with its stern almost broken, and yet the ship’s deck and sides are well preserved”, the company said in a statement on its website. Built in St Petersburg and launched in August 1883, the Dmitrii Donskoi was designed to serve as a commerce raider and was fitted with both a full set of sails and a coal-fired engine. The ship spent most of its operational career in the Mediterranean Sea and the Far East and was ordered to sail from the Baltic to join Imperial Russia’s Second Pacific Squadron after the Japanese fleet destroyed the majority of Russia’s naval power in the Far East in the opening encounters of the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War. The squadron was met by the Japanese fleet in May 1905 and decimated at the Battle of Tsushima. Assigned to protect the transport ships sailing at the rear of the formation, the Dmitrii Donskoi managed to evade the attacking force, but was later intercepted as Captain Ivan Lebedev steamed for the Russian port of Vladivostok. Around 60 of the 591 crew were killed and further 120 injured before Captain Lebedev anchored off the island of Ulleungdo and ordered his men ashore. The following morning, May 29, 1905, the ship was scuttled offshore and the crew were taken prisoner by Japanese landing parties. Captain Lebedev subsequently died of his wounds. There are reports that the Dmitrii Donskoi was carrying the funds that the Russian fleet required to pay for fuel, port fees and the crews of its ships and that it was scuttled with 5,500 boxes containing gold coins and bars still in its holds so that the Japanese would not seize the prize. Some South Korean media have speculated the value of the gold to be worth about US133 billion (HK1.044 trillion). The Shinil Group says it aims to raise the ship in October or November. It added that it has reached an agreement with the Russian government to hand over half of the gold that is found aboard the vessel. Around 10 per cent of the remaining bullion would be spent on tourism projects on Ulleungdo Island, including a museum dedicated to the ship and its crew. A percentage of the rest of the gold will be donated to joint projects designed to promote development in northeast Asia, the company added, such as a railway line linking Russia and South Korea through North Korea. ||||| A South Korean salvage team has discovered the wreck of a Russian warship that was sunk in a naval battle 113 years ago and is believed to still contain a trove of gold bullion and coins worth 150 trillion won, or £100 billion.

Input: Question: What were the names of the five storms formed before Tropical Storm Fay during the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season? Passage:Tropical Storm Fay was a strong and unusual tropical storm that moved erratically across the state of Florida and the Caribbean Sea. The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic. It passed over the island of Hispaniola, into the Gulf of Gonâve, across the island of Cuba, and made landfall on the Florida Keys late in the afternoon of August 18 before veering into the Gulf of Mexico. It again made landfall near Naples, Florida, in the early hours of August 19 and progressed northeast through the Florida peninsula, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Melbourne on August 20. Extensive flooding took place in parts of Florida as a result of its slow movement. On August 21, it made landfall again near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, moving due west across the Panhandle, crossing Gainesville and Panama City, Florida. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in recorded history to make landfall in Florida four times. Thirty-six deaths were blamed on Fay.

If \\"Three women are sitting in front of computers while people stand in front of them with small papers.\\", does this mean that \\"three girls are using some computers\\"?","completion":"Yes, the phrase \\"Three women are sitting in front of computers while people stand in front of them with small papers\\" does indeed imply that 'three girls are using some computers'. However, there are some subtle differences in terms of the context and details between the two phrases to consider. Firstly, the original phrase uses the term 'women' which normally refers to more mature or adult females, whereas the latter term 'girls' is often used to describe younger females or children. Unless we know the ages of the subjects involved, we cannot definitively say that 'girls' and 'women' are interchangeable in this context. Secondly, the full context of the original phrase tells us not only that these women are sitting in front of computers, but it also suggests that some sort of interaction or transaction might be occurring, since there are people standing in front of them with small papers. This setting could be associated with an office environment or some kind of public service area where the women are providing a service or support. The phrase 'Three girls are using some computers,' on the other hand, is more vague. It doesn't give a definite impression of the context or circumstances, which could range from a social setting to a study environment. It simply indicates that there are three girls who are using computers, without further details provided in the original phrase. In conclusion, while both phrases highlight the fact that there are females using computers, the first statement provides a richer and more specific scene compared to the latter. Therefore, while you could argue that 'three girls are using some computers' is a somewhat oversimplified interpretation of the original phrase, it lacks the detail and precision of the initial description."},{"prompt":"Process: - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow.

You are given a new situation: Michael lives near a cliff overlooking the sea. Because of this he has an amazing view of the sunset. One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all. and a hint : When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset. Please answer this question : Given Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, which is the most likely weather, clear skies or overcast? A:","completion":"Given that Michael goes out one day and notices he can't see his shadow, the most likely weather is overcast.

The use of the word \\"probably\\" in the premise indicates that there is a higher probability of the individuals not having access to or using birth control. However, it is essential to consider the context in which this statement is made to better understand the probability of the hypothesis being true or not. It is important to note that the premise does not provide a definitive or absolute statement about the availability or usage of birth control. The term \\"probably\\" leaves room for some level of uncertainty or doubt. This means that there is still a possibility, albeit smaller, that the individuals in question might be using birth control, contrary to what is suggested by the premise. Taking into account this uncertainty, it would be advisable to gather more information and context about the individuals and the circumstances under which the premise was made to make a more conclusive determination about the truthfulness of the hypothesis \\"They are taking birth control.\\" Additionally, exploring cultural, religious, socio-economic, and geographical factors could provide further insight into their access to and usage of birth control methods.

Let's find the value of q in this equation: 0 = 393*q + 1871 - 17984. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining the numbers that don't have q. So, we'll subtract 1871 from 17984. Here's what it looks like: 17984 - 1871 = 16113 Now, our equation looks like: 0 = 393*q + 16113. Next, we'll get rid of the 16113 on the right side. To do that, we'll subtract it from both sides: 0 - 16113 = 393*q -16113 = 393*q Now, we want to find q on its own. So, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 393: -16113 ÷ 393 = q When you divide -16113 by 393, you get: q = -41 And that's it! The value of q is -41.

Washington (CNN) -- The 2012 presidential election shattered spending records, further polarized a divided country and launched a thousand hashtags. The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would â€” Ohio. Here are five things we learned from Tuesday Victorious Obama faces familiar challenges 1. The GOP has a Latino problem \\"If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever,\\" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.

The close race eventually came down to the deciding state of Ohio. There are several key takeaways from the 2012 election. 1. The GOP has a Latino problem: Republican strategist Ana Navarro emphasized that if the Republican Party doesn't improve its standing with Hispanic voters, it could struggle to recapture the White House. In the 2012 election, GOP campaign and allied super PACs supporting the nominee flooded Pennsylvania’s airwaves in the final weeks with a flurry of TV ads. However, the Republican Party did not perform well with the Latino demographic. This is an issue the party needs to address in order to achieve broader electoral success in the future. 2. The power of social media: The 2012 election saw the widespread use of social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to discuss and disseminate information about the candidates. This spawned many hashtag campaigns and underscored the growing importance of digital platforms in engaging with the public and shaping their perceptions of the candidates. 3. The impact of super PACs: The 2012 election also highlighted the vast sums of money being contributed by super PACs (Political Action Committees) to support their preferred candidates. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending by outside groups reached over 1 billion in the 2012 election cycle. This trend has continued to grow in subsequent elections and has raised concerns about the influence of money in politics. 4. The fight for the swing states: Ohio played a critical role in the 2012 election but so did other swing states such as Pennsylvania, Florida, and Virginia. These states have increasingly become the focus of presidential campaigns in recent years, as they often decide the outcome of the election. The intense campaigning efforts and resources allocated to these states by both parties underscore their importance in the electoral map. 5. The persistence of political polarization: The 2012 election displayed the ongoing divide between the Democratic and Republican parties, with each side holding starkly different visions for the future of the country. This divide has only deepened in recent years, with both parties becoming increasingly antagonistic towards each other. This has made it difficult for lawmakers to collaborate on bipartisan legislation and has led to a more polarized political environment. In conclusion, the 2012 presidential election offered several key lessons on the role of demographics, money, social media, and political polarization in shaping electoral outcomes. These factors remain influential today and continue to evolve as the US political landscape undergoes further changes. The race for the White House is always a fiercely contested battle, with each election offering new insights into the workings of the American political system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Rights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country. Benedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East. “Mr. Trump’s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,” said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday. It is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea’s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief. Brad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, “Whatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.” The United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Options: (a). Yes. (b). No. The answer is:","completion":"(b). No. When animals and plants evolve to environmental conditions, the process is generally called adaptation. Through adaptation, organisms become better suited to their environment, which in turn enhances their survival and reproduction. While specialization can indeed occur during adaptation, it is not synonymous with rapid expansion. Specialization refers to the process by which animals and plants develop specific traits or behaviors to deal with particular environmental challenges. This may lead to a more narrow range of suitable habitats or resources, ultimately making them more efficient at exploiting those specific conditions. However, such specialization may also make them vulnerable to changes in their environment and limit their ability to expand rapidly. Rapid expansion typically occurs when organisms can reproduce quickly, possess generalist traits (i.e., not specialized), or can adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions, allowing them to thrive and expand their range.

Introduction In the vast timeline of human history, several notable leaders have ruled their nations with lengthy tenures, often driving significant change and growth. This article aims to answer the question: which leader served for the second longest number of years? To accomplish this, we will examine the tenures of leaders throughout history, while also discussing their achievements and influences. Step 1: Identify the longest-serving leader in history Before identifying the second longest-serving leader, we need to establish which leader holds the title for the longest-serving ruler. According to historical records, the longest-serving leader in history is Fidel Castro, who was the Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976 and the President of Cuba and First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1976 to 2008, totaling 49 years in power. Step 2: Identify contenders for the second longest-serving leader Now, let's determine which historical rulers may contend for the title of the second longest-serving leader. Some potential contenders include: 1. Kim Il-sung: President of North Korea from 1948 to 1994 (46 years) 2. Emperor Hirohito (Emperor Showa): Emperor of Japan from 1926 to 1989 (62 years) 3. King Bhumibol Adulyadej: King of Thailand from 1946 to 2016 (70 years) 4. Elizabeth II: Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 1952 to present (69 years) Step 3: Assess and compare the tenures of contenders For an accurate assessment, the time ruling must be considered continuous and uninterrupted. 1. Kim Il-sung, who served as the President of North Korea for 46 years, is considered the third longest-serving leader. 2. Emperor Hirohito, although having served for 62 years, cannot be considered the second longest-serving leader due to Japan's constitutional monarchy system, which limits the power of the emperor, making him more of a figurehead than a ruler. 3. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled for 70 years, similarly cannot be considered due to the Thai monarchy's limited political power and being a constitutional monarchy. 4. Elizabeth II, with 69 years in her position, is also in a constitutional monarchy that limits her powers, making her an unfit contender for the second longest-serving leader. Conclusion After thorough assessment and comparisons, we can conclude that Kim Il-sung, the President of North Korea from 1948 to 1994, served as the second longest-serving leader in history. Kim Il-sung held power for 46 years, following Fidel Castro's record 49-year tenure as the longest-serving leader. It is important to note the difference, however, between the longest-serving leaders and longest-reigning monarchs who might hold limited political power in their respective nations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a pair of action statements. Your task is to check if you can conclusively identify which statement is less ethical or not. Answer: 'no' if one of the statements is less ethical, and 'yes' otherwise. Problem:ACTION1: warning this guy about his date ACTION2: refusing to oay my ex child support Solution:","completion":"Yes To come up with the answer, I first analyzed the definition or context of the two action statements: ACTION1 - warning this guy about his date: This action implies that someone is providing useful information to another person, possibly to help them avoid an unpleasant experience or situation. In general, this can be considered a good and ethical action, as it is a gesture of goodwill to help someone else. ACTION2 - refusing to pay my ex-child support: This action implies that someone is not fulfilling their legal and moral responsibility to financially support their child(ren) after a separation or divorce. This action is generally considered unethical, as it potentially harms the well-being of the child(ren) by not providing them with the necessary financial resources. After comparing the two actions, it is clear that ACTION2 (refusing to pay my ex-child support) is less ethical than ACTION1 (warning this guy about his date). Therefore, the answer should be 'no', as one of the statements is less ethical."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(Photo: Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin for V Magazine) Kristen Davis knows a few things about what Scarlett Johansson has been going through this week. Five years ago, Davis was a Global Ambassador for the international aid group Oxfam. She was also working as a spokesperson for Ahava, a cosmetics company located in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, which Oxfam deems to be illegally occupied by Israel. Oxfam said she had to choose between Ahava and them. After much pushing and pulling, Davis decided to stick with Oxfam and sever her ties with Ahava, and her contract with them was allowed to expire. Fast forward to this week, when Oxfam announced Johansson's support of the Israeli company SodaStream, operating in a West Bank settlement, was incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador. This time around, the actress chose to stay with her company and part ways with Oxfam. Johansson announced Wednesday that she was resigning her Oxfam role because of a \\"fundamental difference of opinion.\\" Oxfam said it accepted her resignation. The international humanitarian organization said Thursday that it believes SodaStream and other businesses operating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank contribute to the \\"denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support.\\" The charity said it opposes all trade from the Israeli settlements, \\"which are illegal under international law.\\" Pro-Palestinian activists who advocate consumer boycotts of goods produced in Jewish settlements — which are deemed illegal by much of the international community — have encouraged the public to shun SodaStream. The company's main plant is in an Israeli industrial zone next to the settlement of Maaleh Adumim in the West Bank. Approximately 500 Palestinians work at the SodaStream factory in the West Bank. Some 550,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967, along with the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians seek all three territories for a future state. Johansson, who is Jewish, has become a global brand ambassador for SodaStream, and she recently appeared in an attention-grabbing commercial for the company, which has been gaining attention on YouTube and social media sites, and will air on the Super Bowl this Sunday.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, sweetie, these questions are not the same. They are talking about different things. Let me explain: 1. Are there any waterproof inks for fountain pens? This question is asking if there are special inks that don't get washed away with water and can be used in fountain pens. The answer is yes, there are waterproof inks made just for fountain pens, like Noodler's Ink or Platinum Carbon Ink. They dry quickly and don't smudge when they get wet. 2. How do I make fountain pen ink? This question is about how to create ink for a fountain pen by yourself. It's a bit like asking how to make a cake. To make fountain pen ink, you need special ingredients like dye, distilled water, and a humectant, which helps the ink flow smoothly. You mix them together, and then you have your homemade ink! Just remember that making ink can be a bit tricky and messy, so it's always a good idea to ask a grown-up to help you. So, these questions are different – one is about finding waterproof ink for fountain pens, and the other is about how to make your own fountain pen ink.

Summarize this article: Imagine this situation for a moment. You are a pilot preparing for landing. You’ve checked airspeed, alerted cabin and crew, and are all set to make your final descent when all of a sudden you see a guy flying right outside the cockpit window. However surreal, that’s what the pilots of one early summer flight have reported seeing high above the town of Macclesfield, in the United Kingdom; now tentatively dubbed by the public as the “Superman of Macclesfield.” According to the UK’s Daily Mail, the mystery man soared within 320 feet of the massive Airbus A320 on June 13; though at no point during visual contact did he ever appear on radar or deploy a parachute of any sort. PHOTOS: Nissan raced its 370Z NISMO sports car against a wingsuit The UK’s Airprox Board, which investigates airborne near misses, claims the pilots “first sighted the object a few hundred meters in the 11 o’clock position 200 to 300ft above.” The unidentified flying man then proceeded to descend beneath the plane, within 300 to 600 feet of the fuselage, with other crew members glimpsing the spectacle for only a moment while cruising 3,500 feet above terra firma. Subsequent flight data for the day revealed no paragliders, hot-air balloons, or skydivers in the immediate area, which suggests that the airborne man used some sort of wing suit. The official report for the close call found there was “no way of corroborating what they had reported,” though if it was an extreme sports wingsuiter – we’ll probably see footage on YouTube eventually.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Pilots on a passenger plane were stunned when a “flying man” zipped past the side of their aircraft at 3,500ft. Aviation experts admitted they were baffled by the sighting of the human UFO, who has been dubbed Superman of Macclesfield. He appeared from nowhere as the Airbus 320 passed the Cheshire town while it was coming in to land at Manchester Airport. The pilot and first officer, who reported the sighting to air traffic control, thought the man was a paraglider but could not see a canopy. And the mystery deepened when there was no sign of him on radar. (Image: Getty) Further checks failed to find any paragliders, parachutists or ­balloonists in the area at the time. Officials at the UK Airprox Board, which investigates near-misses in British airspace, admitted that the mystery may never be solved. Describing the pilots’ account, the report said: “They first sighted the object a few hundred metres in the 11 o’clock position 200 to 300ft above. poll loading Do you believe in UFOs? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Yes, I've been abducted Yes, ET is a documentary isn't it Yes, we are not alone No, it's all just science fiction “It passed down the left-hand side of the aircraft at 100 to 200 metres. “The crew only saw it fleetingly, there was no time to take avoiding action and they reported that they based their assumptions on it being a person under a canopy.” At the time, skies were clear and visibility was about six miles, the report said. But it added: “Neither can remember seeing a canopy.” (Image: Getty) Air traffic controllers on the ground could also see nothing on their radar screens at the time of the ­incident at 1.30pm on June 13. And experts from the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association said weather conditions at the time would have made it impossible for a lone flyer to be in the area. They also told­ ­investigators the pilots would probably not have missed a canopy or parachute as it “would have been the most obvious object by a ­significant margin”.

It concluded: “The board agreed that it was unfortunate that there was really no information that could lead to identifying the unknown object. “This was frustrating to both the board and the pilots concerned, who had clearly seen something or someone, but there was no way or corroborating what they had reported.” (Image: Rex) The incident was not the first sighting of human UFOs. In April a figure was filmed flying over people in Qutub Minar, India, and the video quickly went viral on the internet. Closer to home in Staffordshire, another man was spotted soaring over Cannock Chase in February 2009. Five people contacted the local newspaper and described it as a “Superman” moment, with one believing he was using a James Bond-style jetpack. In 1969 US Marine Corps private Earl Morrison and two friends saw a strange “winged” figure with a “greenish glow” crossing the night sky near Da Nang, Vietnam. He said: “After it got close enough we could see what it was. It looked like a woman, a naked woman.” ||||| Pilots of a passenger plane over England were stunned recently, when an object they describe as a “flying man” buzzed past their aircraft, at a height of 3,500 feet. The bizarre incident took place as the Airbus 320 was preparing to land at Manchester Airport on July 13, according to The Mirror. Appearing seemingly from nowhere, the mystery man passed within a hundred feet of the aircraft. The pilot and first officer, astounded after sighting the human UFO, reported the incident to air traffic control around 1:30 p.m. At first, they believed that the object was a paraglider, but did not observe a canopy. Controllers were unable to detect any sign of the flying man on radar, and a check of the area failed to turn up any paragliders, parachutists, or ­balloonists at the time of the sighting. The flying man has since been dubbed the “Superman of Macclesfield,” as the Daily Mail notes. Observers have speculated that the flying man was utilizing a wingsuit, though there is no way to accurately assess the possibility. As The Inquisitr reported in 2012, wingsuits have been successfully utilized by skydivers to land without a parachute, though the practice is not common. Is it a plane? Is it a bird? No, it’s a flying man!

According to their report, the pilot and co-pilot first sighted the man when he was about 200 to 300 meters above the plane, in the 11 o’clock position. Flying past the left hand side of the aircraft, the man was only briefly observed by the flight crew, who had no time to take any evasive action. At the time the flying man was sighted, skies were clear, with a visibility of about six miles. The human UFO pic.twitter.com/MPAwnWSj38 — Ian Rigby (@RIGGERZ_GT3RS) October 18, 2014 The report also addressed the unlikely possibility that the object was a balloon, noting that the pilots couldn’t rule out such an explanation. According to experts from the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association, weather conditions at the time would also have made it impossible for an individual flyer to operate in the area. If anyone had been flying near Manchester, they assert, their equipment would have been obvious to radar. Allowing that the incident was frustrating to both the pilots and the Airprox board, the report conceded that there is little way to corroborate the sighting of England’s flying man.

Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes.

Help as much as you can. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: What does Wally Stevens think of fish farming?

The reviewer makes several critical points about the author and their work, highlighting perceived shortcomings and questioning the credibility of the material. Firstly, the title of the review, \\"Misguided,\\" sets a negative tone, implying that the author's perspective is incorrect or misinformed. Then, the reviewer questions the author's academic credentials, which undermines the author's credibility and suggests that they may not have the proper expertise to write about the subject matter. The reviewer also points out that the author provides few facts, which further impacts the credibility and quality of the content. This sentiment is reinforced as the reviewer states the work is \\"plenty in the way of opinions,\\" which implies that the material is more subjective rather than being based on well-established knowledge or research. Moreover, the reviewer claims that the author's economic growth philosophy has been \\"thoroughly discredited among leading economists,\\" which is another negative assertion that diminishes the legitimacy and value of the material.

Just after freeing a pigeon from his classroom, he is called to the headmasters' office to be greeted by Maire (Connie Nielsen), who has adopted him, and takes him back to her island home, where TomÃ¡s is greeted somewhat coldly by her husband, Alec (Aidan Quinn), a fisherman, who had expected someone older and perhaps more confident, and TomÃ¡s is intimidated by Alec. TomÃ¡s makes friends with Nancy (Tara Alice Scully) and is greeted tepidly by Seamus (Jack Gleeson). They take him to their 'secret' cave, inhabited by bats. There, TomÃ¡s runs away, scared, after which his two friends chase after him and console him.

Shortly after pleading not guilty Tuesday to charges related to sensational allegations of hush money payments and lying to federal agents, former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert stood in a packed federal courtroom in downtown Chicago looking extremely uncomfortable. As the judge left the bench and Hastert's high-powered attorneys conferred with prosecutors, Hastert, once one of Illinois' most prominent politicians, remained by himself near the lectern, his shoulders hunched, arms hanging limp at his sides. After a moment, he turned toward the gallery where dozens of reporters and spectators were filing out and pursed his lips. Minutes later, a wild scene unfolded as Hastert and his attorneys were whisked through the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse amid a crush of television news cameras and photographers. Escorted by about a dozen federal Homeland Security agents, Hastert didn't say a word to the media, ducking into a black Lincoln Town Car that sped north on Dearborn Street as passersby stopped to stare. His lawyers had no comment either. The frenzy surrounding the 73-year-old Republican powerhouse's first court appearance since his stunning indictment nearly two weeks ago stood in stark contrast to the routine proceedings in court, where Hastert formally acknowledged the charges and entered a not guilty plea through his attorneys. Standing at the lectern in a dark gray suit and blue tie, Hastert answered, \\"Yes, sir,\\" several times in a barely audible voice as U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin asked him if he understood the charges and the terms and conditions of his bail. The answers marked Hastert's first public words since the indictment was unsealed May 28 alleging he had agreed to pay 3.5 million to a longtime acquaintance to conceal wrongdoing from Hastert's days as a high school teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville. According to the charges, Hastert had already paid 1.7 million to the acquaintance, identified only as Individual A, then lied about it when the FBI questioned him in December. Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert through the years. His withdrawals from banks caught the attention of authorities. The indictment alleges that Hastert made 15 withdrawals of 50,000 apiece over nearly two years but then began illegally structuring the withdrawals in increments of less than 10,000 to avoid federal reporting requirements. While the carefully worded, seven-page indictment only hinted at Hastert's dark past, federal law enforcement sources have said Hastert was making the payments to conceal sexual abuse of a Yorkville High School student. The FBI also interviewed a second person who raised similar allegations of sexual abuse against Hastert, corroborating the account of Individual A, sources said. Since the charges were filed, a onetime Yorkville resident took to national television to allege Hastert sexually abused her now-deceased brother while he was a student. None of those allegations are part of the indictment. As the details have trickled out, Hastert remained silent and away from public view for 12 days. Even the identity of his attorney wasn't confirmed until Monday afternoon when Thomas Green and John Gallo of the law firm of Sidley Austin LLC filed their official appearances with the court. Dennis Hastert arrives at Sidley Austin in Chicago on Tuesday morning. (Jeff Coen, Chicago Tribune) Dennis Hastert arrives at Sidley Austin in Chicago on Tuesday morning. (Jeff Coen, Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS Hastert's long-awaited day in court began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, when he was spotted by reporters leaving his sprawling estate in far west suburban Plano in the hired black Lincoln. About an hour later, he arrived at Sidley Austin's Loop offices two blocks north of the courthouse, ignoring reporters who shouted questions through the vehicle's closed window. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Town Car pulled up in front of the courthouse and Hastert emerged amid a scrum of cameramen and reporters, with Gallo clearing the way with a forearm. Several Homeland Security officers escorted Hastert through the revolving doors and the line for the metal detector. The former speaker did not respond to shouts for comment, including one person who yelled, \\"Who is Individual A?\\" As Hastert neared the elevator bank, a national television news reporter stopped one of his lawyers to talk, leaving Hastert standing by himself. After briefly getting in an elevator car with a Tribune and Sun-Times reporter, Hastert exited the car when another attorney motioned to him that they needed to go to the 11th floor to meet with the pretrial services department. Outside Durkin's 14th-floor courtroom, meanwhile, a long line of people stretched down the hall hoping to attend the arraignment. A nearby courtroom was set up to handle the overflow crowd. Shortly after members of the media had been ushered in, filling up the jury box and at least one half of the gallery, Hastert walked into the courtroom about 1:45 p.m. For 15 awkward minutes before the hearing began, Hastert sat at the defense table, his eyes darting to the ceiling and then down to his hands as reporters observed him and scribbled notes. Later, as the attorneys conferred with each other, Hastert sat by himself, staring straight ahead. The 20-minute arraignment hearing was highlighted by Durkin addressing head-on some potential conflict-of-interest issues that arose after he was randomly selected as the judge to hear the high-profile case. The judge noted — as reported by the Tribune last week — that he had made two donations totaling 1,500 to Hastert's campaign more than a decade ago while he was a private attorney at the Mayer Brown law firm in Chicago. He also said he had written an email in the mid-1990s to a Hastert staffer as part of his effort at the time to be appointed to the federal bench. \\"But nothing came of it,\\" said Durkin, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama only a few years ago. Durkin acknowledged his brother is Jim Durkin, the current Republican leader of the Illinois House, but he said Hastert \\"is not a personal friend of my brother\\" and the relationship would have no bearing on him overseeing the case. In addition, the judge said he had worked at the same law firm as Hastert's son, Ethan, including working closely on one matter together in 2011. \\"We were friendly business colleagues, but I do not consider him a personal friend,\\" Durkin said. The judge said he had \\"no doubt\\" he could be impartial in the case. Still, federal statute calls for him to step aside if his impartiality \\"might reasonably be questioned,\\" he noted. By that standard, Durkin said he would recuse himself from the case unless both sides agree to keep him on as judge. He asked the parties to make that decision by Thursday afternoon. \\"I will not be offended whatever the result, I assure you,\\" the judge said. If Durkin was disqualified — a rare step in federal court — another judge would then be randomly assigned to the case. ||||| CHICAGO — After days of silence, J. Dennis Hastert, a former speaker of the House of Representatives, on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he illegally structured bank withdrawals and lied to the authorities about millions of dollars he had promised to pay someone for misconduct that occurred decades ago. In a dark pinstripe suit and with his familiar helmet of gray hair, Mr. Hastert, 73, stood slightly stooped before the judge, flanked by lawyers, quietly answering the judge’s questions with a simple “yes” or “yes, sir.” It was the first time the once-powerful former congressman had appeared in public since the charges were announced last month, and he was met with a chaotic crush of news media in the federal courthouse here. Aside from entering a not guilty plea, Mr. Hastert and his lawyers offered no further sense of their response to the charges, which are narrowly focused around financial transactions but which have raised a cloud of allegations of sexual misconduct for a man who had receded from public life. The provisions of his release were routine yet stark for a man whose career arc had carried him from revered, small-town wrestling coach to the Illinois Statehouse and on to one of the top leadership posts in Congress. In addition to posting a 4,500 bond, Mr. Hastert was ordered to surrender his passport, remain in the continental United States, advise the court of any change in his address, and remove guns from his home within two weeks. ||||| Hastert pleads not guilty The former House speaker emerged after more than a week in seclusion. CHICAGO — After more than a week in seclusion, former House Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded not guilty Tuesday to two criminal charges that he violated federal banking law and lied to FBI agents as they investigated his alleged agreement to pay 3.5 million in hush money to cover up a past transgression. Hastert, who became the longest-serving Republican speaker before the GOP lost the House in 2006, was released after entering the plea in front of U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin at an afternoon hearing, which raised questions about whether Durkin will continue or the case will be reassigned to another judge. Story Continued Below Hastert, 73, looked much as he did during the height of his power, slightly stooped and with a shock of gray hair as he trudged into the packed courtroom clad in a dark pinstripe suit and blue tie. He stood in front of the judge’s bench throughout the roughly 15-minute hearing, softly answering the judge’s questions — usually with “Yes, sir.” Hastert’s lead defense attorney, Tom Green, spoke for Hastert when it came time to offer a plea. “The defendant enters a plea of not guilty to both counts of the indictment, your honor,” Green said. Before the hearing, the ex-speaker turned criminal defendant spent more than an hour behind closed doors on another floor of the courthouse, going through the usual booking process, which involves fingerprinting, mug shots and providing a swab of DNA for a massive federal database. The well-traveled Hastert also surrendered his passport, Green said. Durkin, who was randomly assigned to the case, announced at the hearing that he was provisionally recusing himself due to several personal and family ties to Hastert, Hastert’s relatives and the Republican Party, as well as lawyers on both the defense and prosecution teams. Reading for several minutes from a prepared statement, Durkin outlined the links created by Illinois politics and his professional history as a prosecutor and lawyer in private practice. “As far as I can recall, I have never met the defendant,” the judge said. He quickly noted that — as POLITICO first reported — he made donations to Hastert’s reelection campaigns in 2002 and 2004. “These contributions were made while I was a private citizen, after leaving the U.S. attorney’s office and before I became a federal judge,” Durkin said. He said the donations were “made through” a fellow lawyer at Mayer Brown, the law firm where Durkin then worked. The judge went on to note that he worked for a time with Hastert’s son Ethan, who is also a partner at Mayer Brown. Durkin said there was “one matter” they were both assigned to that resulted in he and Ethan Hastert taking three or four work trips together. Their relationship was “friendly,” but they are not “personal friends,” the judge said. Durkin also disclosed that he emailed one of Dennis Hastert’s staffers in the mid-’90s in a bid to secure a judgeship. Durkin’s nomination to the bench did not come until about 20 years later, when President Barack Obama tapped him in 2013. The judge also noted that his brother Jim is the Republican minority leader of the Illinois House. “I’ve never met the defendant through Jim,” the judge said. “The defendant is not a good friend of my brother.” After outlining his ties to the lawyers on both sides of the case, Durkin said all the connections he listed wouldn’t affect his judgment in the case. “I have no doubt I can be impartial in this matter. If I had any such doubt, I would have disqualified myself on the day it was assigned to me,” the judge said. However, the judge went on to say he was “not so naive” as to think that others might not question his impartiality, so he officially recused himself from the case. Still, the recusal could turn out to be short-lived. Durkin said such recusals can be waived if both sides agree. He also set up a confidential process for them to weigh in that should keep him from knowing who effectively vetoed his involvement, if either or both sides do. The judge set a tight deadline of Thursday afternoon for the defense and prosecution to make up their minds. “I don’t want this issue to linger,” Durkin said. Many lawyers expect both sides to agree to keep the judge on the case. Durkin set a 4,500 unsecured bond as a condition of release for the former speaker, instructing Hastert to surrender his passport and firearms within two weeks, as well as to provide a DNA sample and avoid others associated with the case. On his way in and out of the courthouse, Hastert faced a chaotic maelstrom of TV cameras and journalists pressing him to comment on news reports that the “misconduct” he allegedly was trying to cover up involved sexual misconduct with a student when Hastert worked decades ago as a high school teacher and wrestling coach. AP photo On the eve of the hearing, Hastert shifted his legal team by tapping D.C. white-collar specialist Green and a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, John Gallo. The two attorneys, both with the law firm Sidley Austin, replaced another prominent defense lawyer, Barry Levine of Dickstein Shapiro — the same firm Hastert resigned from as a lobbyist when the charges were announced late last month. While Green is known for high-profile defense roles in the Iran-Contra investigation, legal insiders say that if the case moves toward a plea bargain, Gallo and other former prosecutors at Sidley’s Chicago office could play key roles in negotiating a deal. Gallo’s familiarity with the prosecutors on the case, Steven Block and Carrie Hamilton, was evident as the lawyers chatted informally before the hearing began. Green’s novelty to the case and the prosecution team was clear Tuesday as he introduced himself to the prosecutors for the first time. Hastert sat quietly at the defense table during that wait, alternately folding his hands and laying them flat on the table. The atmosphere was awkward as dozens of journalists — some, because of limited space, seated in the jury box directly facing the former speaker — watched Hastert intently and silently for about 15 minutes as everyone awaited the scheduled start of the hearing. Neither the former speaker nor his lawyers commented as they entered and left a federal courthouse that in recent years has seen the prosecution and conviction on corruption charges of a slew of major Illinois political figures, including former Govs. George Ryan and Rod Blagojevich. Aside from the not guilty pleas he offered Tuesday, Hastert has not publicly addressed the charges since his May 28 indictment. But in a brief interview with POLITICO several days before the charges were filed, he denied wrongdoing and maintained that his finances were not the subject of a federal investigation. At Tuesday’s hearing, the defense waived a formal reading of the indictment, which alleges Hastert agreed to pay 3.5 million to an undisclosed individual and forked over 1.7 million of that before the charges were filed. Nearly 1 million of that was withdrawn from the former speaker’s bank accounts in increments of just under 10,000 after bankers warned him that larger cash withdrawals would trigger reports to the authorities, the indictment claims. Prosecutors said little during the session, but when the judge asked for details of the potential penalties, Block noted Hastert could face up to five years in prison and a 250,000 fine on each of the two felony counts. However, judges usually impose sentences in accordance with federal guidelines that call for more lenient punishment for offenders with no serious criminal record. A plea deal could also reduce Hastert’s sentence. Many criminal defense lawyers believe such a deal is probable because a jury is not likely to look favorably on a defendant trying to cover up alleged sexual abuse of a student. One of the charges brought against Hastert — structuring cash transactions to avoid federal reporting requirements — is unpopular among defense lawyers and libertarians because it can render routine cash banking transactions in increments of just under 10,000 illegal even if the reason for the cash payments or withdrawals is lawful. Critics contend that prosecutors use the structuring law to bring charges or force guilty pleas from defendants when the government lacks proof to make a case for drug trafficking or tax evasion. Some judges have reacted skeptically when the feds have brought cases in which there is no charge that the underlying conduct was illegal. The nature of Hastert’s reported relationship with the acquaintance who allegedly received the hush money is unclear, but experts say the statute of limitations in Illinois for a criminal prosecution on sexual abuse from the 1970s expired long ago. Hastert, who as speaker was once second in line to the presidency, resigned his House seat in 2007 after he lost the speaker’s post due to the Democrats’ victory in 2006. He is the highest-ranking current or former federal official to face criminal prosecution since Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in 1973 and pleaded guilty to a felony tax evasion charge. Nick Gass contributed to this report from Arlington, Virginia. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"On Tuesday, former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert pleaded not guilty to charges related to allegations of hush money payments and lying to federal agents.

WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

His most notable works include \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\", which was later adapted into the movie \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"The Man in the High Castle\\", \\"A Scanner Darkly\\", among others. Dick is often recognized for his exploration of sociological, political and metaphysical themes in novels dominated by monopolistic corporations, authoritarian governments, and altered states.

In this particular context, William White is providing some biographical information about Dick, particularly about the death of his twin sister Jane shortly after their birth and her impact on Dick's life and work. This information serves to give more insight into Dick's life, perhaps hinting at some of the themes in his writing and personal struggles, including his battle with drug abuse and his untimely death at age 53.

News article: Monica Bonvicini review - S&M gear has kinks ironed out A Murano glass strap-on gleams under fluorescent light, in a play area with the gear all waiting: chains and black leather, a dangling noose and a body harness slung from the ceiling. I have been in S&M clubs like this, and so too has Monica Bonvicini. Since the 1990s such places have provided inspiration for her art. So too has the building site, the power tool and hardware store. As fetishistic as it is fun, muted as it is aggressive, her art is a kind of invitation. Her Baltic exhibition is a series of rumpus rooms, dark corners and sudden shocks. What are we waiting for? But where have all the kinksters gone? Perhaps they have taken the advice given by the sculpture Bonvicini made for the 2012 London Olympics. The outdoor sculpture, in huge mirrored and LED-lit letters, just said “RUN”. Boys and their toys are a consistent focus for Bonvicini. A hanging cluster of conjoined chainsaws hangs from steel chains; a hammock, entirely made of a super-abundancy of chains, with decorative little black leather tassels, hovers over a black carpet. The aesthetic here is a kind of industrial rococo. All that’s missing is the perfume of machine-oil lubricant. Galvanised and nickel-plated, chains hang in catenary curves, spool on to the floor, and sit in a rough wedge on top of a mirrored cube. They spell out the word Prozac and decorate a staircase made from scaffolder’s poles that leads to nowhere. Everyone has their thing – Bonvicini’s is chains. Outside, guys in hi-vis jackets, helmets, tool-belts and abseiling gear are battling the wind and the rain, affixing metal lettering on the exterior north wall of Baltic. Below, a river the colour of stewed tea flows past. Satisfy Me, the signage says. In this weather? You must be joking. The same words are printed across a table under strong, hot lights behind a sturdy barrier inside the Baltic, in a corner of a labyrinthine installation of false rooms and corridors. This bleak entreaty could be some sort of institutional critique of the art gallery, and the promises it makes but so often fails to deliver. Expectation and disappointment are a constant. Maybe that’s why we keep going back. Behind glass, a hammer and a handsaw are sewn into body-hugging, tight leather suits. There’s no chance of a sniff or a lick. They have the menace of dozing reptiles; ordinary things that can be turned to malicious intent or unlikely pleasures. Telescopic steel props lean against the walls, like bystanders. One has gold watches dangling from its handle. Another carries a little leather pouch. Is this some sort of dress code? Nearby, a drill slung from the ceiling suddenly starts up, capering and spinning on its wires, a deadly dancer impotent in a sealed room, visible through a glass wall. A minimal black rhomboid is all strapped-up with belts, and so is the couch. This is art in bondage, but only to itself. Wherever she shows, Monica Bonvicini gets apprentice builders to build their fragments of architecture. Anything can be art, and art often looks a bit like this. Their structures are ranged about the floor, like slapdash rearrangements of Carl Andre’s infamous bricks. In 1999 Bonvicini also began sending out questionnaires to building workers in the various towns and cities where she was due to have exhibitions. ‘What does your wife/girlfriend think of your rough and dry hands?’, she asks, and goes on to enquire why construction workers are almost always men, and whether respondents think there is anything erotic about construction. Heaven forfend, they reply, or something like it. She asks for building-site jokes (the answers invariably lewd), and whom the workers would like to wall up, and how do you get along with your gay colleagues? An entire wall at Baltic is taken up with a selection of 234 framed replies, in various languages, the most recent coming from builders in Newcastle and Gateshead. “She loves it rough”, answers one about his calloused hands. There are no complaints in the bedroom, according to the writers, and no problem with gay colleagues, though many claim not to have any. One respondent is the lone lesbian on an all-male crew, while another woman says that all the girls want to wear her tool-belt. All this is amusing, and mostly lives up to the often depressing stereotypes of a predominantly masculine workforce, though Bonvicini’s sample, and her questions, are hardly scientific. Bend over. This is the only way, unless you are a child or very short, to look through the little spyholes set in the gallery wall. Each is a little magnifying lens, giving a view of a distant room, a tiny fish-eye distorted image of a gallery where a show is either going up or coming down, stuff piled up between bare white walls. Rooms, then, waiting for something to happen. Squinting through the peephole I feel like a peeping tom, but then I always do. We are all voyeurs here. But no one comes and no one goes. We could be waiting a long time. One minute you are blasted by a hanging arrangement of dazzling white strip-lights, the next you find yourself in a quiet, dark cul-de-sac where an oversized image of a partly open door is projected on to the end wall. Suddenly the static video image comes to life and the door slams. Bonvicini wants to give us a jolt. It works the first time, but then I am inured. Bonvicini’s is an art of diminishing returns. In any case, you can get used to anything. It leads to an ever more extreme and eccentric quest for a thrill. “I defy any amateur of paintings to love a canvas as much as a fetishist loves a shoe,” wrote Georges Bataille. When people say they love art I often wonder what they mean. If I’m an art lover, I am still looking for that perfect object of my desire. Don’t tell me it doesn’t exist. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about a review of Monica Bonvicini's exhibition. The exhibition has a theme inspired by S&M clubs and building sites, using chains, tools, and industrial items as materials. Bonvicini's artwork includes sculptures, installations, and texts. She explores themes of expectations, power dynamics, and the role of men in construction. The exhibition has elements of surprise and contains interactive pieces for the visitors, offering a range of emotions and experiences.

Write an article based on this summary: A man who killed his parents after telling police they had been replaced with imposters like in the film Face/Off has failed in a bid to have his sentence reduced. Article:","completion":"Title: Man Fails in Attempt to Reduce Sentence for Killing Parents, Claiming They Were Replaced by Imposters Introduction: A recent court case involving a man who killed his parents after believing them to be replaced with imposters as portrayed in the film \\"Face/Off\\" has attracted significant attention. The individual sought to have his sentence reduced, but ultimately failed in his endeavor. This article will delve into the details of the case and provide insight into the reasons behind the court's decision. Step 1: Provide Background Information In order to understand the context of the case, it is essential to provide information on the events leading up to the tragic event. The man, who remains unnamed for legal reasons, reportedly began to believe that his parents were imposters after watching the 1997 action film \\"Face/Off.\\" This film, directed by John Woo and starring Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, tells the story of a dangerous criminal and a heroic cop who literally swap faces, thereby fooling those around them. Step 2: Explain the Crime and the Man's Actions Despite the clear fantastical nature of the film, the man became convinced that his parents had been replaced by imposters. In a desperate attempt to stop these perceived threats, the man took matters into his own hands and murdered his parents, later telling the police about his actions and the supposed reason behind them. Step 3: Detail the Court Proceedings and Decision The court case focused on the man's mental health and his ability to differentiate between reality and fiction. Expert witnesses were brought in to provide their opinions on the man's state of mind at the time of the murders. Ultimately, the court ruled that the man was fully aware of his actions and their potential consequences, making him liable for his crime. Step 4: Discuss the Attempt to Reduce the Sentence In a subsequent appeal, the man's legal team attempted to have his sentence reduced, arguing that the case involved circumstances that were not typical of a premeditated murder and that their client was suffering from a delusional disorder. However, the court rejected this argument, maintaining that the man's actions were deliberate, and that his mental state did not absolve him of responsibility for the crime. Step 5: Analyze the Implications of the Court's Decision The court's decision has numerous implications for the way mental health issues are addressed in criminal cases. While the man's belief that his parents were imposters might be indicative of mental illness, the court ruled that this did not absolve him of responsibility for his actions, even if it influenced his motivations. This suggests that, in the eyes of the law, there may be limits to the extent to which mental health issues can be considered as a mitigating factor in violent crimes. Conclusion: The case of the man who killed his parents after believing them to be imposters based on the film \\"Face/Off\\" has drawn attention to the challenges faced by courts in handling cases involving mental health issues. While the court acknowledged the influence of his delusional beliefs, it did not consider them sufficient grounds for a reduced sentence. As legal systems continue to evolve, this case may serve as an example of the complexities that arise when mental health concerns intersect with the criminal justice system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By emphasizing their gratefulness for this particular group, the speaker implies that they either have a connection to that particular role or recognizes the aircrew's significant contribution to the overall safety and security of the region.

Suddenly, Han takes a bullet in the shoulder, disrupting the conference. Lee pursues the assassin and corners him, discovering that the assassin is his \\"brother\\" Kenji. When Lee hesitates to shoot Kenji, Carter shows up driving towards the two and accidentally nearly runs Lee over, allowing Kenji to escape.In the hospital, Lee learns that Han will make a full recovery. Han's daughter, Soo Yung (Zhang Jingchu), now grown up, arrives and makes Lee and Carter promise to capture the one behind the shooting. She then informs Lee and Carter that her father gave her an envelope which contains important information regarding the Triad, and that the envelope is in her locker at the martial arts studio where she works. Lee and Carter make their way to the martial arts studio where they battle a giant, (Sun Ming Ming), but find out that a gang of armed men had already arrived and taken the contents from the locker.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Rush Hour: Brotherhood in Arms\\" The title clearly connects the film to its prequels \\"Rush Hour\\" and \\"Rush Hour 2\\" while also introducing a new element of the story. \\"Brotherhood in Arms\\" is a double entendre referencing both the physical battles that Lee and Carter will engage in, as well as the emotional battle Lee must fight against his “brother” Kenji. It implies the complex relationship between Lee and Kenji, hinting at the intense conflict to come, while also suggesting the strong bond between Lee and Carter, echoed in their collaborative efforts to protect Han and Soo Yung, and defeat the Triad. The title insists on the suspenseful and action-filled encounters the movie is filled with, adding to the intrigue and attracting an audience interested in action-packed plots and complex relationships. It also emphasizes the theme of 'brotherhood', not just in blood but in bond, hinting at the emotional depth that will be explored between the characters amidst the adrenaline-fuelled plot. “Rush Hour: Brotherhood in Arms” suggests to the viewer that this movie will be a suspenseful and action-packed ride, featuring familiar characters in unfamiliar and dangerous situations, forced to confront their past and protect their loved ones. The 'In Arms' suggests a considerable amount of action and conflict that these 'brothers' in the action will face, adding to the allure for fans of action and drama. This makes it a worthy next instalment in the \\"Rush Hour\\" series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people.

And we are left with the ultimate conclusion that where true love is concerned at least, the answer is a resounding \\"Yes\\" to a Grand Design. An easy-going garage mechanic, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), meets Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan), a successful Princeton University mathematics doctoral candidate, as she comes into the garage, accompanied by her resistant and critical English fiancÃ©, acerbic experimental psychology professor James Moreland (Stephen Fry). There is an immediate \\"electric\\" connection which Ed recognizes, but she is not yet aware. Ed sees his future, briefly, and Catherine is a major part of it; they are married, and have children together. \\"How long will all of this take?\\" asks Catherine, referring to the car repair, and Ed, thinking about their future life together, replies, \\"That's up to you\\". His life purpose has suddenly been decided by a force of nature greater than himself. Finding a watch she left at the garage, Ed travels to her address and finds himself face to face with Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau), who is Catherine's uncle.[1] Albertâportrayed as a fun-loving geniusâand his mischievous friends, fellow scientists Nathan Liebknecht (Joseph Maher), Kurt GÃ¶del (Lou Jacobi), and Boris Podolsky (Gene Saks), see Ed as someone who would be better suited for Catherine.

What is the answer: Which great guitarist had the first names Aaron Thibodaux?","completion":"The great guitarist with the first names Aaron Thibodaux was Aaron Thibeaux \\"T-Bone\\" Walker. T-Bone Walker, born on May 28, 1910, in Linden, Texas, was an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter who was a pioneer in his field, significantly influencing the development of electric blues guitar. Aaron Thibeaux Walker was born to musically inclined parents, who both played instruments. He started his music career at a young age - initially playing the banjo, guitar, and piano. Later in his career, T-Bone adopted a new sound by using the electric guitar, a relatively new instrument at the time, and became one of the first to successfully employ the instrument in blues music. T-Bone Walker began performing in the 1920s and gained recognition for his innovative guitar techniques, which influenced generations of blues and rock guitarists. He used the guitar not only to produce melodic lines but also to create distinctive rhythmic patterns. His signature playing style included single-string picking, bent notes, and the use of vibrato, which later became common among blues and rock guitarists. Apart from his guitar skills, T-Bone Walker was also known for his smooth vocal delivery and engaging stage presence, often combining flashy showmanship with his guitar performances. One of his most famous recordings was the 1942 hit \\"Mean Old World\\" produced by Capitol Records. The song, with Walker's smooth vocals and dazzling electric guitar solo, became a template for many blues songs that followed. However, T-Bone Walker's most significant contribution to blues and guitar music came with his 1947 hit \\"Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just as Bad)\\" or simply \\"Stormy Monday.\\" This song is now considered a blues standard and has been covered by numerous artists throughout the years, including the Allman Brothers Band and Eric Clapton. T-Bone Walker went on to enjoy a successful career that spanned four decades, and he continued to tour and record until just a few years before his death in 1975. His influence can be heard in the music of guitar icons such as B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, to name just a few. In conclusion, Aaron Thibeaux \\"T-Bone\\" Walker is considered one of the most influential guitarists in the history of blues music. His innovative playing style, including the use of the electric guitar, affected not only the direction of blues but also rock music. Walker provided a foundation for countless future guitar legends, thanks to his extraordinary talent, creativity, and passion for music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The North American fur trade was the industry and activities related to the acquisition, trade, exchange, and sale of animal furs in North America. Aboriginal peoples in Canada and Native Americans in the United States of different regions traded among themselves in the Pre-Columbian Era, but Europeans participated in the trade beginning from the time of their arrival in the New World and extended its reach to Europe. The French started trading in the 16th century, the English established trading posts on Hudson Bay in present-day Canada in the 17th century, and the Dutch had trade by the same time in New Netherland. The 19th-century North American fur trade, when the industry was at its peak of economic importance, involved the development of elaborate trade networks. Deerskin trade was at its most profitable in the mid-18th century. The Creeks rose up as the largest deerskin supplier, and the increase in supply only intensified European demand for deerskins. Native Americans continued to negotiate the most lucrative trade deals by forcing England, France, and Spain to compete for their supply of deerskins. In the 1750s and 1760s, the Seven Years' War disrupted France's ability to provide manufactures goods to its allies, the Choctaws and Chickasaw. The French and Indian War further disrupted trade, as the British blockaded French goods. The Cherokees allied themselves with France, who were driven out from the southeast in accordance with the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The British were now the dominant trading power in the southeast. While both the Cherokee and the Creek were the main trading partners of the British, their relationships with the British were different. The Creeks adapted to the new economic trade system, and managed to hold onto their old social structures. Originally Cherokee land was divided into five districts; however, the number soon grew to thirteen districts with 200 hunters assigned per district due to deerskin demand. Charleston and Savannah were the main trading ports for the export of deerskins. Deerskins became the most popular export, and monetarily supported the colonies with the revenue produced by taxes on deerskins. Charleston's trade was regulated by the Indian Trade Commission, composed of traders who monopolized the market and profited off the sale of deerskins. From the beginning of the 18th century to mid-century, the deerskin exports of Charleston more than doubled in exports. Charleston received tobacco and sugar from the West Indies and rum from the North in exchange for deerskins. In return for deerskins, Great Britain sent woolens, guns, ammunition, iron tools, clothing, and other manufactured goods that were traded to the Native Americans.","completion":"This text is about the North American fur trade, specifically focusing on the deerskin trade and its impact on various Native American tribes, European trading powers, and the development of trade networks in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who decides to learn how to drive? Thirty years old and single, Pauline \\"Poppy\\" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive. When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset, he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless. Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school, Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action.

Background: Jean-Marie Le Pen (French pronunciation: [Za ma.Ri l@.pen]; born 20 June 1928) is a French politician who has served as Honorary President of the National Front since January 2011 and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from France since 2004, previously between 1984 to 2003. He previously served as President of the National Front from 1972 to 2011. Context: Le Pen is often nicknamed the \\"Menhir\\", due to his \\"granitic nature\\" as he is perceived as someone who does not give way to pressure or who cannot be easily knocked down. It also connects him to France's Celtic origins. Le Pen is often described as one of the most flamboyant and charismatic orators in Europe, whose speech blends folksy humour, crude attacks and rhetorical finesse. However, Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France: opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 IPSOS poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion. Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as \\"neither right, nor left, but French\\" (ni droite, ni gauche, francais). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the \\"socialo-communists\\" and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself \\"socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French\\" (socialement a gauche, economiquement a droite, nationalement francais). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the \\"establishment\\" and lumped all major parties (Communist, Socialist, Union for French Democracy (UDF) and Rally for the Republic (RPR)) into the \\"Gang of Four\\" (la bande des quatre - an allusion to the Gang of Four during China's Cultural Revolution). Question: What are the opinions about him?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The opinions about Jean-Marie Le Pen are quite polarized in France.

However, Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label.

Le Pen saw most of the French political and media class as corrupt and out of touch with the needs of the common people.

When would the ribcage contract, state A or state B? Keith is a physician in a local hospital. He is treating a patient with respiratory problem. He looked at two different states of the patient's diaphragm, state A and state B. In state A the the diaphragm contracted, but in state B the diaphragm relaxed. He now needs to figure out other phenomena related to this. Hint: Inhaling is an active movement that results from the contraction of a muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm is large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs (see Figure below ). When the diaphragm contracts, the ribcage expands and the contents of the abdomen move downward. This results in a larger chest volume, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. With lower air pressure inside than outside the lungs, air rushes into the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the opposite events occur. The volume of the chest cavity decreases, air pressure inside the lungs increases, and air flows out of the lungs, like air rushing out of a balloon. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The ribcage would contract during state B. In state A, the diaphragm contracts, leading to the ribcage expanding and increasing chest volume, resulting in inhalation. In state B, the diaphragm relaxes, causing the ribcage to contract, decreasing chest volume, and leading to exhalation as air flows out of the lungs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: TO BUNDLE UP is not manly. Sure, that’s a generalization, but it’s undeniably true that many guys will simply grit their teeth through the cold—until things reach a dangerous point. (Foolishly losing a finger to frostbite isn’t the height of masculinity, either.) They’ll rely on just a wool muffler with a suit when the rest of the world has armed itself in proper coats. They’ll make do with just an overcoat when everyone else has graduated to bulbous parkas. But the advent of sleeker down jackets that are still as cozy-warm as their Michelin Man-size predecessors has made it possible to defy the cold without looking like a wimpy 5-year-old. When sandwiched between your sweater or suit and a beautifully tailored wool overcoat, these so-called “diet-down” jackets are a true sartorial win-win. This fashion-meets-function layering technique has already earned dedicated fans. “With a topcoat or pea coat, the insulating factor is just not there,” said Dominick Volini, 34, a partner in new fast-casual Manhattan restaurant Inday. And so, in deep winter, Mr. Volini wears his black Patagonia down sweater—really a jacket but so-named because it takes up no more room than a cardigan—under his trim navy Armor Lux pea coat. Though a number of brands—from premium ones like Norse Projects to Japanese fast-fashioneer Uniqlo—now make a version of these pieces, Patagonia was among the first to crack the code in the early aughts. The company’s design team, comprised heavily of climbers and hikers, was tired of bulky, overstuffed outerwear. So they decided to tackle the challenge of creating a lighter jacket without sacrificing warmth. Patagonia designer Eric Rice found the answer, explained Kristo Torgersen, the company’s global product line director of alpine and snow. Mr. Rice reduced the size of each individually quilted section on the lightweight nylon shell. He then plumped the smaller quilts with an 800 fill-power goose down whose big plumes provide warm with less density. And thus was born Patagonia’s down sweater (229), now available in a hooded version (279) and a range of colors, from neons to neutrals. From brand to brand, these jackets truthfully vary little, but consider color carefully. You can quite easily go the stealth route, choosing a shade that discreetly echoes your overcoat’s hue. When you layer black under black or navy under navy, few people need be any the wiser that you’re packing sporty nylon-and-feathers beneath that dashing cashmere-and-wool. If you’re feeling more adventurous, an acid green or cherry-red jacket can provide a satisfying hit of color on dismal December days. Play around a bit, especially when it comes to weekend ensembles. Try a camel coat with a kelly green or slate-grey puffer or a dark tweed topper with an olive nylon layer. The lighter look of these jackets also makes them more attractive when worn alone. “It’s a very different silhouette than the ’90s North Face,” said Brad Bennett, 34, a marketing consultant. “It’s not like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle shell.” Mr. Bennett, who lives in the Hudson Valley in New York, and works in Manhattan, particularly appreciates the versatility. “If you’re walking the dog, you just throw on a puffer and go,” he said. “If you need to look nice, put a jacket on top. You can have that coziness and not look like a schlub.” And if it turns out that you don’t need that layer at all? Many of these slender jackets come with a little matching pouch into which the jacket can be stowed. If you’re keeping track at home, that’s a win-win-win.","completion":"Title: \\"Slim Down Jackets: The Stylish Solution to Men's Cold-Weather Dilemmas\\""},{"prompt":"Q: In this task, you will be presented with a question in Dutch language, and you have to write the location names from the question if present.

Dà Yuán (大元) is from the sentence 大哉乾元 (dà zai Qián Yuán / Great is Qián, the Primal) in the Commentaries on the Classic of Changes (I Ching) section regarding Qián (乾). The counterpart in Mongolian language was Dai Ön Ulus, also rendered as Ikh Yuan Üls or Yekhe Yuan Ulus. In Mongolian, Dai Ön (Great Yuan) is often used in conjunction with the Yeke Mongghul Ulus (lit. Great Mongol State), resulting in Dai Ön Yeke Mongghul Ulus (Mongolian script: ), meaning Great Yuan Great Mongol State. The Yuan dynasty is also known as the Mongol dynasty or Mongol Dynasty of China, similar to the names Manchu dynasty or Manchu Dynasty of China for the Qing dynasty. Furthermore, the Yuan is sometimes known as the Empire of the Great Khan or Khanate of the Great Khan, which particularly appeared on some Yuan maps, since Yuan emperors held the nominal title of Great Khan. Nevertheless, both terms can also refer to the khanate within the Mongol Empire directly ruled by Great Khans before the actual establishment of the Yuan dynasty by Kublai Khan in 1271.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the drink made from sorghum and urwagwa in the cuisine that is based on local staple foods? The cuisine of Rwanda is based on local staple foods produced by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat more than a few times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes tripe, beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called Ikigage made from sorghum and urwagwa, made from bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.

The duo consists of Alison Goldfrapp (vocals, synthesizer) and Will Gregory (synthesizer). Despite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the Mercury Prize, their 2000 debut studio album Felt Mountain did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album Black Cherry, which incorporated glam rock and synthpop sounds into their music, was released in 2003. Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005. The album comprises pop and electronic dance music prominently featured on Black Cherry, but focuses more on subtle hooks instead of the large choruses that made up its predecessor. The band never intended to create dance music, however, previous releases were popular across nightclubs in North America and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Supernature debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum in the UK. As of February 2008, it had sold one million copies worldwide. The album received a Grammy Award nomination in 2007 for Best Electronic/Dance Album and \\"Ooh La La\\" was nominated for Best Dance Recording. The song was used for the iPhone 5S's commercial in 2013. \\"Ooh La La\\", the album's lead single, became Goldfrapp's first UK top five single. The song was chosen as the lead single \\"because it was up and in your face and carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album\\". \\"Ooh La La\\" became the first song performed by the band to feature the electric guitar and was cited as a highlight of the album by Allmusic. \\"Number 1\\" was released as the album's second single. Constructed around a synthesiser and bass arrangement, it was written about the importance of relationships. The album's third single \\"Ride a White Horse\\" was inspired by the disco era and reached number 15 in the UK. \\"Fly Me Away\\" was released as the album's fourth single, but did not perform as well as its predecessors. In 2006, Goldfrapp released We Are Glitter, a North American-only compilation of remixes from Supernature. It included a Flaming Lips remix of \\"Satin Chic\\", the band's favourite song from the album.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When was it released?","completion":"Supernature, Goldfrapp's third album, was released in August 2005."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Jorge Posada days as Yankees full-time DH seem to be over as he sits vs. A's for Andruw Jones BY Mark Feinsand DAILY NEWS SPORTS WRITER Wednesday, June 1st 2011, 4:00 AM OAKLAND - Jorge Posada's days as a full-time designated hitter appear to be over. The veteran was out of the lineup again Tuesday night, as Joe Girardi started Andruw Jones at DH against lefthander Brett Anderson. Posada won't start again Wednesday against southpaw Gio Gonzalez, as Girardi hinted that Alex Rodriguez would get a turn as the DH. Girardi stopped short of calling his DH situation a platoon, although he acknowledged that \\"you could look at it that way\\" given Posada's 0-for-26 skid against lefties this season. Posada's last start against a lefty came on May 7 in Texas against Derek Holland. \\"Jorge hasn't had success right-handed this year, but he's had success in the past,\\" Girardi said. \\"It's just kind of worked out that way. (Brett Gardner) has hit lefthanders as well and Andruw Jones has hit them lately. I guess you could look at it that way, but when a lefty was in there, I let Jorge face the lefthander (Monday) night. It's not that I'm going to completely take every at-bat against Jorge against lefthanders.\\" Girardi hasn't sat Posada down to tell him he won't see any action against lefties, although the manager isn't committing to giving him any such at-bats, either. \\"I can't say that I won't, but I can't say that I necessarily will,\\" Girardi said. \\"I don't want to get boxed in here.\\" Asked how long the Yankees can wait for struggling hitters such as Posada (.169) and Nick Swisher (.213) to turn things around, Brian Cashman said it's a \\"feel\\" thing. Swisher went 1-for-4 with a walk against the A'sÂ Tuesday night. \\"You have to give it some time, get a feel and make some decisions when we feel they're appropriate - if we think they need to be made,\\" Cashman said. \\"We're worried about anybody who is struggling. When we get those guys going, we'll focus on whoever else is struggling. Swish had a good series in Seattle, so hopefully that's a sign that he's on the come for us.\\" LEADING MANFor all the talk about Derek Jeter's .259 batting average this season, the captain has been getting the job done as a leadoff hitter. Jeter has gotten on to lead off the first inning 21 times in 42 games this season, including a single to start Tuesday night's contest. Jeter entered Tuesday night hitting .375 with a .430 on-base percentage when leading off any inning. \\"That's pretty good,\\" Girardi said before Jeter went 2-for-4 with three runs scored Tuesday night. \\"That's giving your team an opportunity to score in the first inning. I think he's playing pretty well.\\" WELCOME BACKRussell Martin returned to the lineupÂ Tuesday night and went 0-for-4 after missing the past two games with a sore left big toe...

The United States has lost the war on drugs. Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other. Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and has befriended the main woman he has been spying on: a cocaine addict and Substance D supplier named Donna. Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of Substance D from Donna so that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier, but he has also developed seemingly unrequited romantic feelings towards her.

Investigation advances as more remains recovered from MH17 site A coffin containing more remains from the MH17 crash site touches down in the Netherlands. (AAP) A plane carrying remains of victims from the MH17 crash site in eastern Ukraine has flown back to the Netherlands as Malaysian experts joined the international probe at the crash site. Ukraine's government said the plane was taking the latest remains found by the search operation, as well as DNA and belongings that had been kept in the rebel-held city of Donetsk for some time. Before Monday's flight, 227 coffins had been taken to the Netherlands -- which suffered the most casualties in the July 17 crash -- for the painstaking identification process. But Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the Dutch police mission in Ukraine said Sunday: \\"We expect that there will be more flights to the Netherlands in the near future.\\" A total of 298 passengers and crew were killed when the Malaysia Airlines jet -- flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur -- was blown out of the sky almost three weeks ago. The probe into the crash -- the second plane disaster involving Malaysia Airlines this year -- has been repeatedly delayed because of fighting in the region between government forces and pro-Moscow separatist fighters. The US says insurgents shot down the plane with a surface-to-air missile likely supplied by Russia, but Moscow and the rebels blame the Ukrainian military. Malaysian experts have also joined Dutch and Australian police for the first time as they continued combing the area for traces of the victims, according to a statement from the Dutch security and justice ministry. The experts were briefly prevented from accessing the rebel-held site but eventually let through, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has been monitoring the situation in Ukraine and has monitors accompanying the experts. \\"Work has resumed at the MH17 crash site by 100-plus experts,\\" it tweeted. Sniffer dogs were accompanying the experts, it had said. In all, 124 experts were present at the scene and \\"planned to explore two fields west of the crash site,\\" the government in Kiev said in separate statement. In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai vowed that arrangements to repatriate the bodies of its citizens killed in the crash would be made \\"once bodies have been identified and the necessary forensic work completed\\". \\"Efforts to locate and identify victims of the MH17 tragedy continue,\\" he added, noting that a national day of mourning would be organised once all remains of the Malaysian victims have returned home.

Question: suppose a bigger satellite is designed happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER satelites in space. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"Suppose a bigger satellite is designed, this will likely have the following effects on MORE or LARGER satellites in space: 1. Space congestion: More larger satellites could lead to space congestion, as they occupy more volume in their orbits. This could increase the risk of space collisions between satellites and other space debris. As a result, there could be a need for better tracking and management of satellites. Effect: More. 2. Signal interference: Larger satellites might have more powerful transmitters or receivers. This could potentially cause signal interference with other satellites operating on similar frequencies if not managed properly. Effect: More. 3. Launch costs: Bigger satellites generally require larger, more powerful rockets to launch them into orbit. This could lead to increased launch costs for these bigger satellites. Effect: More. 4. Maintenance and decommissioning: Larger satellites might have more complex systems and components that may require additional maintenance or could be more difficult to decommission once their operational life is over. This could lead to added costs and logistical challenges. Effect: More. 5. Orbit availability and allocation: If more, larger satellites are launched into space, this might limit the availability of desired orbits and require stricter allocation of orbits to accommodate these larger satellites. Effect: More. Perturbation in the design or size of a bigger satellite can influence the second effect mentioned—signal interference. For example, if the size and design of the satellite cause it to have a more powerful transmitter or receiver, the potential for signal interference with nearby satellites may increase, particularly if the frequencies used by these satellites are not managed properly. In this case, the perturbation in the design can lead to a \\"more\\" effect on signal interference. However, if proper frequency management and coordination are implemented, signal interference can be minimized or avoided, leading to \\"no effect\\" on this specific consequence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The runaway success of one of the tracks he composed and performed, \\"Samy Mandeha Samy Mitady\\", elevated salegy from a regional genre to one of nationwide popularity, leading a newspaper to declare him the \\"King of Salegy\\".

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that their 160GB Maxtor one-touch firewire drive suddenly stopped working after only 14 months of use. The fact that it died in such a short time indicates that the product may not be durable or reliable. Additionally, the reviewer's negative experience with Maxtor's response further supports the negative tone of the review, as they were left feeling unsupported and unassisted by the manufacturer. Secondly, the reviewer also reported issues with their 300GB Maxtor One-touch II drive, specifically mentioning a software bug in the Windows XP drivers that crashes their computer frequently.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the name of the album \\"Death of a Clown\\" was on? The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\". The songs on the 1967 album, Something Else By The Kinks, developed the musical progressions of Face to Face, adding English music hall influences to the band's sound. Dave Davies scored a major UK chart success with the album's \\"Death of a Clown\\". While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single. Overall, however, the album's commercial performance was disappointing, prompting the Kinks to rush out a new single, \\"Autumn Almanac\\", in early October. Backed with \\"Mister Pleasant\\", the single became another Top 5 success for the group.... The answer is:","completion":"The album that the song \\"Death of a Clown\\" is on is called \\"Something Else By The Kinks\\". This album, released in 1967, developed the musical progressions of a previous album by the group, \\"Face to Face\\". \\"Death of a Clown\\" was a significant UK chart success for Dave Davies, who co-wrote the song with bandmate Ray Davies.

Options: - grocery store - refrigerator - freezer - plate - supermarket Explain why a human would choose \\"freezer\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"freezer\\" A human would choose \\"freezer\\" as the answer to this question because the primary goal mentioned is to avoid the cabbage from spoiling. Out of all the given options (grocery store, refrigerator, freezer, plate, and supermarket), a freezer is the most appropriate choice to achieve this purpose by preserving the cabbage's freshness and preventing spoilage. When comparing the options, the grocery store and supermarket are not suitable choices, as the question assumes that the individual already possesses the cabbage and does not need a location to purchase it from. These options also do not provide any means to maintain its freshness or prevent spoilage. A plate is also not the right choice since leaving the cabbage on a plate at room temperature would not actively contribute to preserving its quality. Over time, the cabbage may begin to deteriorate and spoil. Between the refrigerator and the freezer, the freezer is the preferred option in this context. While the refrigerator does provide a cool environment suitable for storing various foods, it may not be sufficient to prevent spoilage over an extended period. Refrigerators maintain a temperature above freezing, meaning that the cabbage will remain fresh for a shorter time compared to when it is stored in the freezer. In contrast, a freezer typically keeps the temperature below the freezing point, which helps slow down the processes that lead to spoilage, such as bacterial growth and enzymatic reactions in the cabbage. Freezing the cabbage also preserves its texture, color, and nutritional value for extended periods – often months or even longer if properly wrapped and sealed. In conclusion, a human would choose the \\"freezer\\" option when trying to find the best solution to prevent cabbage spoilage. The freezer's ability to maintain a temperature below the freezing point aids in preserving the freshness and prolonging the cabbage's shelf life, making it the most effective choice among the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Euroopan unionin on tällä hetkellä noudatettava useita kansainvälisiä sopimuksia, jotka sääntelevät yhteisön laivaston toimintaa eri merialueilla. Näiden sopimusten tarkoituksena on varmistaa kestävä kalastus sekä suojella merellistä ympäristöä, luonnonvaroja ja monimuotoisuutta. Sopimuksilla pyritään myös edistämään ja helpottamaan kansainvälistä yhteistyötä kalastuksen hoidossa ja valvonnassa. Mikäli Euroopan unioni joutuisi luopumaan näistä sopimuksista äkillisesti, seuraukset olisivat merkittävät sekä Euroopan että kansainvälisellä tasolla. Ensinnäkin kalastuksen hoidon ja valvonnan kannalta olisi useita kielteisiä vaikutuksia. Yhteisön laivaston tilalle astuisivat kilpailevat laivastot, kuten Aasian maista tulevat, mikä johtaisi kalastuspaineen voimakkaaseen lisääntymiseen. Tämä puolestaan saattaisi johtaa kalakantojen ehtymiseen ja meriympäristön tilan heikkenemiseen. Toiseksi, tällainen tilanne johtaisi luultavasti myös kauppapoliittisiin jännitteisiin Euroopan unionin ja muiden maiden, kuten Aasian maiden, välillä. Jos Euroopan kalastajat menettäisivät pääsynsä perinteisiin kalastusalueisiinsa, se voisi vaikuttaa merkittävästi heidän toimeentuloonsa ja maiden välisten suhteiden luonteeseen. Kolmanneksi, jos EU joutuisi luopumaan näistä sopimuksista, se vaarantaisi sen jo saavuttamia tuloksia kestävän kalastuksen edistämisessä. Kestävän kalastuksen ja luonnonvarojen suojelun tavoitteet saattaisivat jäädä toteutumatta monilla merialueilla, mikä olisi uhka sekä merellisen ympäristön että maapallon ekosysteemille. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että Euroopan unionin luopuminen merisiin sopimuksiin liittyvistä sopimuksista johtaisi moniin kielteisiin seurauksiin niin yhteisölle kuin koko maailmalle. Yhteisön laivaston paikalle syntyvä tyhjiö täyttyisi nopeasti kilpailevilla laivastoilla, joiden kalastuskäytännöt saattaisivat olla kestämättömiä ja vaarallisia ympäristölle ja kalakannoille.

Your USB flash drive should plug into one of the rectangular or oval USB or USB-C ports on your computer's housing. Traditional flash drives only fit one way, so don't force the drive if it doesn't fit. If your Mac uses USB-C ports, your USB-C flash drive should fit any way in which you insert it. The USB flash drive should be at least 8 gigabytes in space so that it can accommodate most operating system installation files. If you want to create a bootable USB drive on a Mac, you'll need to have an ISO file (or an image file, if you're backing up your computer's hard drive) ready to drag and drop into Terminal. This is different than how Windows handles bootable flash drives, since you can make a flash drive bootable and then save it for later when using Windows. Click the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of the screen. A search bar will appear. This will search your Mac for the Terminal application. It's a black box in the middle of the Spotlight search results. Doing so will open Terminal. Type diskutil list into Terminal, then press ⏎ Return. Look for the USB drive that you plugged into your computer, then look at the USB drive's name under the \\"IDENTIFIER\\" heading. You'll usually find your USB drive under the \\"(external, physical)\\" heading near the bottom of the Terminal window. Your USB flash drive's name under the \\"IDENTIFIER\\" heading will normally be something like \\"disk1\\" or \\"disk2\\". Type diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disknumber—making sure to replace \\"disknumber\\" with the disk's \\"IDENTIFIER\\" name and number (e.g., disk2)—into Terminal, then press ⏎ Return. Type in sudo dd if= but don't press the ⏎ Return key just yet. Click and drag the ISO file (or disk image file) that you want to boot into using the USB drive into the Terminal window. This will copy the file's address into the Terminal command. You can also type in the folder path to the ISO file. This will put a space at the end of the file's address, making room for the next command. Type in of=/dev/disknumber bs=1m, again making sure to replace \\"disknumber\\" with the USB flash drive's number (e.g., disk2), and press ⏎ Return. This is the password that you use to log into your Mac. As you type, you'll notice that the letters don't appear in Terminal; this is normal. Doing so submits your password and prompts your Mac to begin creating a bootable USB flash drive with your selected ISO or image file. This process can take several hours to complete, so just leave Terminal open and your Mac plugged in.

Abstract: Systematic literature reviews are widely used as an aid to evidence based decision making. For example, reviews of randomised controlled trials are regularly used to answer questions about the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. The high profile of systematic reviews as a cornerstone of evidence based medicine, however, has led to several misconceptions about their purpose and methods. Among these is the belief that systematic reviews are applicable only to randomised controlled trials and that they are incapable of dealing with other forms of evidence, such as from non-randomised studies or qualitative research. The systematic literature review is a method of locating, appraising, and synthesising evidence. The value of regularly updated systematic reviews in the assessment of effectiveness of healthcare interventions was dramatically illustrated by Antman and colleagues, who showed that review articles failed to mention advances in treatment identified by an updated systematic review.1 It is nearly a quarter of a century since Gene Glass coined the term “meta-analysis” to refer to the quantitative synthesis of the results of primary studies.2 The importance of making explicit efforts to limit bias in the review of literature, however, has been emphasised by social scientists at least since the 1960s.3 In recent years systematic reviews have found an important role in health services research, and the growing interest in evidence based approaches to decision making makes it likely that their use will increase. Not everybody accepts that systematic reviews are necessary or desirable, and as one moves further away from the clinical applications of systematic reviews cynicism about their utility grows. Several arguments are commonly used to reject a wider role for systematic reviews, and these arguments are often based on major misconceptions about the history, purpose, methods, and uses of systematic reviews.

The second new work was Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring given under the French title, Le sacre du printemps.

My one desire was to flee that room and find a quiet corner in which to rest my aching head.

Despite his initial reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving practical advice to help the composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, and to get the orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number.

The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

He liked his new school and made friends there, but then things at home started to change. His mum and dad began to argue and the arguments got worse and worse until one day, Daniel's mum left. With his father working long hours, Daniel felt very lonely and very unhappy. He wanted to escape, to run away. And that's what he did. Very early one terribly cold morning when the snow was deep on the ground, he packed a bag with some clothes, some chocolate and a map of Canada and set off to a forest. He ran and ran until he could hardly breathe. His feet were heavy with the snow but he still walked on through deep snow, not even watching where he was going. Then, disaster struck. A rock hidden by the deep snow caught his feet and Daniel fell to the ground. He had broken the bone. He was very cold and was starting to feel tired, but he knew that if he fell asleep in the snow, he would certainly die from the cold. A tree shook ahead. From within the branches , a pair of yellow eyes watched Daniel. The puma had been following him. A puma is a large wild cat with claws that could tear Daniel into pieces. But instead of moving in for the kill, the puma walked up to Daniel and lay across his chest, arms and legs. Daniel was too frightened to move, but soon the warmth of the animal reached Daniel and he began to feel better. From time to time, the puma pressed his muzzle against Daniel and rocked his head gently. Clearly, the puma knew that Daniel must not fall asleep. This animal should have been a real danger to Daniel and yet the boy began to feel safe. They remained like that for several hours until Daniel and the puma heard voices. The rescue team had found them. Options: A Daniel lost his way in the forest. B The heavy snow blocked the way. C Daniel fell down and got hurt. D A puma wanted to attack Daniel.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The 1923 Tokyo earthquake\\" correctly answer the question \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"The 1923 Tokyo earthquake\\" correctly answers the question \\"What event allowed the zaibatsu conglomerates to take advantage of an economic upsurge?\\" The paragraph mentions that even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed, and riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question. Article: If you ask someone why he or she wears clothes, the answer will probably be \\"to keep warm and to cover my body\\". These are the basic reasons why clothes are worn, but people also want to look attractive and appear successful to others. If people only wore clothes for warmth and to cover their bodies, most clothes would be simple and cheap. In most Western countries, however, clothes are sometimes very expensive. The main reason for this is not the cost of the cloth or the cost of making the clothes. The clothes are expensive because of fashion . Successful businessmen, for example, often wear very expensive suits, shirts and ties. Sometimes they pay thousands of dollars for a suit and hundreds of dollars for a tie. It's just a suit and a tie but they pay these prices because of the famous name of the designer. A suit costing much less would be just as warm and would cover the wearer's body just as well. Fashion is always changing, which means those who want to be fashionable have to buy new clothes every few months, even if last month's clothes have only been worn once or twice. Some people have wardrobes full of clothes that have hardly been worn but are no longer in fashion. Being fashionable, therefore, can be a very expensive pastime ! Question: We can learn from the passage that _ .

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of Allan Alvarez's two loves? The story is a flashback of the five years (2005 to 2010) of love affair involving the characters of Allan Alvarez and Mia Samonte. The opening scene was in a Pasig River ferry boat. One of the passenger, Allan, was sad and confused if he really loved his then live-in partner, Daphne Recto. While another passenger, Mia, was downtrodden by family problems. To express her heartaches, Mia would write messages on stones and would leave them anywhere, Allan picked up one of those, they got acquainted and their romantic story began. Later, in one of their trysts, they met an old man in Paco Park who predicted that they were meant for each other and would end up together although it would take a difficult five-year ride. Allan was torn between two loves. Although he knew that he loved Mia more, he procrastinated in his choice. Mia left for Malaysia. Two years after, when Allan finally broke free from his indecision, he went to Malaysia to look for Mia only to find out that she was already engaged to another guy. It was now Mia's turn to make a choice. She chose the new guy who loved her so much and the one she knew could help her support her family. Even though she honestly knew in her heart that she still loved Allan. Allan did not lose hope. He patiently waited for Mia for another three years. He firmly believed that she would come back to him as predicted by the old man earlier in the story.

The Tlingit language (English: , ; Tlingit: Lingit [linkit]) is spoken by the Tlingit people of Southeast Alaska and Western Canada. It is a branch of the Na-Dene language family. Extensive effort is being put into revitalization programs in Southeast Alaska to revive and preserve the Tlingit language and culture. Missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church were the first to develop a written version of Tlingit, using the Cyrillic script to record and translate it, when the Russian Empire had contact with Alaska and the coast of North America down to Sonoma County, California. Tlingit has eight vowels, four vowels further distinguished formally by length. However, the length distinction is often in terms of tenseness rather than length, particularly in rapid speech. For the Northern dialect, the dominant spoken dialect of Tlingit and the standard for written Tlingit, every vowel may take either high or low tone; in the orthography high tone is indicated by an acute accent, e.g. aa, and low tone is unmarked, e.g. aa. The Southern and Transitional dialects have a mid tone which is unmarked and additional low tone which is marked by a grave accent, e.g. aa. As noted in the vowel chart above, there is an allophone of /a:/ (orthographic aa) which is realized as [a:] under the influence of uvular consonants, however this is not consistent for all speakers. The backness influence arises from articulation with uvular consonants, thus the word khaa \\"person\\" is often spoken as [qha:], whereas the word (a) kaa \\"on (its) surface\\" is said as [(?^) kha:] by the same speakers. Word onset is always consonantal in Tlingit, i.e. no word may begin with a vowel. Where one would occur theoretically by e.g. prefixing or compounding, the vowel is obligatorily preceded by either [?] or [j]. The former is universal in single words, and the latter is found varying with [?] in word-medial position in compounds. The orthography does not reflect the [?] in word-initial position, but either . or y may be seen in medial position. For example, the word khoowat'aa \\"the weather is hot\\" (khu-yu-ya-t'aa, INDH.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) is phonetically [qhu:w^t'a:], but when the perfective prefix yu- is word initial in uwat'aa \\"it is hot\\" (0-yu-ya-t'aa, 3NEU.OBJ-PERF-(0, -D, +I)-hot) the phonetic form is [?Uw^t'a:] where the glottal stop appears to ensure that the word begins with a consonant. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: what do you mean by tones?","completion":"By \\"tones\\" in the Tlingit language, the article refers to the variations in pitch that can be applied to vowels, which can change the meaning or function of words.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A Singular Mercedes Aims for Another Record DOMINATOR The Mercedes W196 at the 1954 German Grand Prix; a streamlined W196 can be seen farther back. More Photos » A 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 grand prix car raced by the five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina will go on the block Friday at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain. The rarity and historical significance of the car make it a contender to set a record for an automobile sold at auction. Driven by Fangio to wins at the grands prix of Germany and Switzerland in its debut year, it is the only one of the 14 built for the Mercedes racing team in 1954 and 1955 that found its way to a private owner. The current high-water mark for a car sold at public auction is 16.4 million, brought by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa racing sports car of unimpressive provenance at a sale in Pebble Beach, Calif., in August 2011. The Mercedes auction, to be conducted by Bonhams, has attracted considerable attention because of the carâs breakthrough engineering and its dominance in both seasons of its competitive career, taking Fangio to consecutive world drivers championships. The W196 â the factoryâs internal designation for the cars â was built in two versions, open-wheel and with a streamlined body, and with three different wheelbases. The car was powered by an in-line 8-cylinder engine that had its power takeoff in the middle, making it the equivalent of two 4-cylinder engines, a measure intended to minimize crankshaft whip. The engineâs valvetrain used a desmodromic system for positive mechanical opening and closing, and it was equipped with fuel injection, an innovation at the time. Ten of the original 14 cars still exist: six remain with Mercedes and three are in museums, in Indianapolis, Vienna and Turin, Italy. The continuing surge in the prices paid for classic cars has given rise to speculation of a sale price of around 20 million. Other factors â the car canât be driven without a support staff of mechanics, it canât be licensed for the road â may keep it out of record territory, though. A veteran collector and car dealer, Don Williams, head of the Blackhawk Collection, has maintained for years that the âheavy hittersâ with millions to spend donât go to auctions. But, he said in a telephone interview, âIf you donât buy this one, you wonât be able to find another.â The top prices in recent private sales â generally accepted as correct by experts close to the transactions but not confirmed by the parties involved â are on another scale: 40 million in 2010 for a 1936 Bugatti Atlantic by Peter Mullin, who specializes in French cars, and 35 million for a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO coupe by the collector Craig McCaw last year. The W196 for sale at Goodwood was presented by Daimler-Benz to the Beaulieu National Motor Museum in Britain in 1973 with the understanding that it would be kept in the museum. But there was no binding agreement. The museum eventually sold it to the British heavy equipment manufacturer Sir Anthony Bamford. It later went to a French collector, then to a German, and about 10 years ago was bought by a member of the ruling family of Qatar. Whatever the sale price, the value escalation in the vintage and classic car market has been little short of staggering. When Henry Manney, a Road & Track editor, brought his Ferrari GTO to California from Europe in the 1960s, he had no takers at 8,000 and had to lower the price to 6,000. By these standards, the Bugatti collector Dr. Peter Williamson paid what must have been considered an exorbitant price when, in 1971, he gave 59,000 for the car now owned by Mr. Mullin.","completion":"A special car called the 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 raced by a famous driver named Juan Manuel Fangio will be sold at an event called the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain.

Question: - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process mentioned is when the star becomes a red giant. This occurs when the star exhausts the hydrogen fuel in its core through nuclear fusion, causing the core to contract and the outer layers to expand. As a result, the star's surface temperature cools, and its color changes to red.

Hartman and Lincoln are two alpha males with a long-running rivalry, with only room at the top for one sharpshooter. Lincoln however was dismissed and jailed for accidentally killing a hostage (the son of the bank chairman) during a bank robbery committed by crime boss Tao (Jack Kao). Lincoln maintained in defense that Tao was about to pull the pin of a grenade but no one else on the Sniper Team could support his story, indeed there is a feeling that Hartman (who was the only other person who could have been in a position to see Tao with the grenade) may have withheld key evidence that would have exonerated Lincoln. Back to the present, upon his release from prison after a four-year stint, Lincoln still harbors a grudge against his former SDU teammates despite being welcomed back into society by Shane.

In the South Seas, a volcano explodes, eventually causing North Pole icebergs to shift. Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir. Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis. He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop. Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Was my new cell phone being charge using induction or conduction? With my previous cell phone, in order to charge it I would have a plug the charger into the wall and the plug the cord into my phone to connect it to the electric source. With my new phone, I just place the phone into the charging dock and my phone is charge wirelessly. Hint: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Your new cell phone was being charged using induction. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that your new phone charges wirelessly when placed on the charging dock. This process is accomplished through charging by induction, where the phone and the charging dock do not need to touch directly or have a physical connection to transfer energy.

With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\".

Inappropriate location: Finding a crab in your underpants is not only highly unexpected but also extremely uncomfortable. Crabs should be found in water or natural habitats where they can survive and thrive, not in such a personal and intimate space. 2. Health and hygiene concerns: Having a crab in your underpants poses potential health risks such as injury from the crab's claws, causing pain and discomfort. Additionally, the presence of a crab in such a location may lead to unhygienic conditions and possible infections. 3. Safety issues: A crab's natural defense mechanism involves using its claws to pinch and hold onto things. Having a crab in one's underpants could lead to injury from the crab's claws, especially in sensitive areas. 4. Other options are related to natural habitats or food chain: Comparing \\"underpants\\" to the other options like Chesapeake Bay, Seychelles, fishing boat, and cooking pot - these are all places where finding crabs would make sense in terms of their natural habitats, where they are commonly found, or food preparation.

Question: \\"What might have strengthened the structural integrity of the cathedrals in Gothic styles?\\" Context: \\"From the early 12th century, French builders developed the Gothic style, marked by the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, flying buttresses, and large stained glass windows. It was used mainly in churches and cathedrals, and continued in use until the 16th century in much of Europe. Classic examples of Gothic architecture include Chartres Cathedral and Reims Cathedral in France as well as Salisbury Cathedral in England. Stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches, which continued to use extensive wall-paintings, now almost all lost.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The structural integrity of cathedrals in Gothic styles might have been strengthened by several architectural innovations, including the use of rib vaults, pointed arches, and flying buttresses. 1. Rib vaults: These are a type of ceiling structure made up of intersecting arched ribs, which help distribute the weight of the roof more evenly across the supporting walls. This allowed for thinner walls and larger window openings, making room for stained glass windows. 2. Pointed arches: Unlike rounded Romanesque arches, pointed arches direct the weight of the structure down towards the ground more effectively, reducing lateral force on supporting walls. This allowed architects to build taller, more slender structures. 3. Flying buttresses: These are external, arched structures that support the walls and help counteract the lateral force exerted by the roof and vaults. They enabled architects to build taller, narrower walls with larger windows, again allowing for the incorporation of more stained glass. These innovations in Gothic architecture not only strengthened the structural integrity of cathedrals but also allowed for greater use of light and intricate detailing, such as the extensive use of stained glass windows, a hallmark of the style."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His head is kept hooded, and his \\"owner,\\" who views him as retarded, is paid by Treves to bring him to the hospital for exams. Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights his monstrous skull, which forces him to sleep with his head on his knees, since if he were to lie down, he would asphyxiate. On Merrickâs return he is beaten so badly by Bytes that he has to call Treves for medical help. Treves brings him back to the hospital. John is tended to by Mrs. Mothershead, the formidable matron, as the other nurses are too frightened of Merrick. Mr. Carr-Gomm, the hospitalâs Governor, is against housing Merrick, as the hospital does not accept âincurablesâ. To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say a few conversational sentences. Carr-Gomm sees through this ruse, but as he is leaving, Merrick begins to recite the 23rd Psalm, which Treves did not teach him. Merrick tells the doctors that he knows how to read, and has memorized the 23rd Psalm because it is his favorite. Carr-Gomm permits him to stay, and Merrick spends his time practicing conversation with Treves and building a model of a cathedral he sees from his window. Merrick has tea with Treves and his wife, and is so overwhelmed by their kindness that he shows them his motherâs picture. He believes he must have been a \\"disappointment\\" to his mother, but hopes she would be proud to see him with his âlovely friendsâ. Merrick begins to take guests in his rooms, including the actress Madge Kendal, who introduces him to Shakespeare.

Question: \\"What policy serves to protect children according to the church?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\".

Premise: \\"The rule is designed to strengthen the Commission's enforcement of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented. \\"?","completion":"The premise, which states that \\"The rule is designed to strengthen the Commission's enforcement of the Children's Television Act of 1990 (CTA)\\", tells us that there was a specific rule created for the purpose of enhancing the implementation of the CTA. The CTA itself is a law aimed at promoting educational programming for children and limiting the number of commercials during children's programs. The premise implies that the Commission, most likely referring to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in this context, found that the existing mechanisms for enforcing the CTA needed improvement, and therefore, a new rule was created to address this issue. However, the premise does not provide explicit information about the process through which the rule was established. Therefore, it is not logically necessary that it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented.\\" Nevertheless, some contextual understanding of how rules and regulations typically come into force can offer an educated conjecture concerning the hypothesis. In general, when a new rule or regulation is proposed, there is a formal process followed by government agencies or commissions to ensure that all stakeholders have the opportunity to review, discuss, and possibly vote on the proposal before it is implemented. In the case of the FCC, rulemaking procedures typically involve a period of public comment, followed by internal review and analysis that could ultimately result in the adoption of a final rule. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the rules in question were probably voted on before they were implemented. The premise depicts a situation in which the Commission has identified a deficiency in their enforcement of the CTA and recognizes the need to establish a stronger rule. It is expected that the decision-making process would have involved deliberation and a consensus reached among the members of the Commission. However, it is important to note that this inference is based on an understanding of typical rulemaking procedures in government agencies and not deduced from the premise itself. The premise does not provide enough information to definitively confirm the hypothesis that \\"The rules were voted on before they were implemented.\\" Thus, while the hypothesis might be considered plausible given the context, the premise itself does not directly entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Dealing with a Car Accident: Essential Steps to Follow After the Incident Introduction Car accidents can happen anytime, anywhere and to anyone, leaving victims startled, confused, and at times, injured. In the heat of the moment, it can be difficult to think clearly about the necessary actions that should be taken immediately after an incident. The key to handling this stressful situation is staying calm and prepared. This article outlines the crucial steps to be followed in the aftermath of a car accident, focusing on three main areas: looking for witnesses, exchanging information with the other involved party, and documenting the incident. 1. Look for Witnesses Whether the car accident is a major collision or just a minor fender-bender, it is crucial to have witnesses who can corroborate the events that took place. Witnesses can provide additional perspectives on the incident and may be able to provide vital evidence that can help determine fault or liability in the future. When seeking out witnesses, follow these steps: - Identify potential witnesses: Look around the area where the accident occurred for individuals who may have witnessed the incident. This can include pedestrians, other drivers, or even security personnel. - Approach them politely: Explain the situation calmly and ask if they saw the accident. If they agree to provide a statement, make sure to get their contact information, including their names and phone numbers. - Take brief statements: Ask the witnesses to provide their account of what happened in brief detail. Record their statements either through writing or recording on a digital device if possible. 2. Exchange Information with the Other Driver In most jurisdictions, it's mandatory to exchange personal and insurance information after a car accident. The importance of this step cannot be understated, as it lays the foundation for insurance claims and potential legal processes. Make sure to exchange the following information with the other driver: - Full names and contact details of all the parties involved. - Insurance company information and policy numbers. - Driver's license numbers. - License plate numbers and registration information. - Vehicle make, model, and year. It is essential to remain calm and respectful during this step, as tensions might be high or emotions heightened. 3. Document the Incident Proper and thorough documentation of the car accident is essential to protect yourself legally and ensure a smooth insurance claims process. Take the following actions to document the incident: - Photograph the scene: Use your phone or any other camera device to take clear pictures of the accident scene, capturing the damage to the vehicles, road conditions, and any traffic signs. - Record the location, date, and time: Note the exact location of the accident, including street names, landmarks, and the date and time it occurred. - Draw a diagram: Sketch a simple diagram of the accident scene, including the position of each vehicle before and after the collision, as well as any relevant traffic signs. - Write down your observations: Record what you believe happened, including details about the weather, visibility, and road conditions. - Collect relevant documents: Keep the police report, insurance information, and any other relevant documents in an organized file for future reference. Conclusion Dealing with a car accident can be a nerve-wracking experience, but by following these essential steps, you can ensure a smoother process for filing insurance claims, handling any legal issues, and moving forward with your life. Always remember to stay calm and communicate effectively with the other party and witnesses involved. Most importantly, prioritize your safety and the safety of others around you, seeking medical attention when necessary or appropriate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The oldest record of written history dates from Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his \\"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\\" (c. 155053) in XIVXV. Another version was published in 1634, by Giambattista Basile with the title \\"Cagliuso\\". The tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (16281703), a retired civil servant and member of the \\"Académie française\\". The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\\". The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's \\"Histoires\\" has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was \\"Costantino Fortunato\\", but was later known as \\"Il gatto con gli stivali\\" (lit. \\"The cat with the boots\\"); the French title was \\"Histoires ou contes du temps passé, avec des moralités\\" with the subtitle \\"Les Contes de ma mère l'Oye\\" (\\"Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals\\", subtitled \\"Mother Goose Tales\\"). The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \\"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \\"Puss in Boots\\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act \\"pas de caractère\\" of Tchaikovsky's ballet \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\", for example, and makes appearances in other media, most famously the sequels to the animated film \\"Shrek (film)\\". Puss in Boots is a popular pantomime in the UK. - Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down ! ( Spanish : ¡ Átame ! , pronounced : ( a.ta.me ) , \`\` Tie Me !

If \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain.\\", does this mean that \\"There are childern playing\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain\\" implies that \\"There are children playing.\\" This is because toddlers are young children who are usually between the ages of 1 to 3 years old. Let us analyze both the statements to understand the connection between them. Statement 1: \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain.\\" In this statement, we are given the following information: 1. There are two individuals involved. 2. These individuals are toddlers, which indicates that they are children. 3. The activity they are engaging in is playing. 4. The specific location where they are playing is a water fountain. Statement 2: \\"There are children playing.\\" This statement is broader and conveys the following information: 1. There are one or more individuals involved. 2. These individuals are children. 3. The activity they are engaging in is playing. As we can see, the second statement is a general statement that refers to children playing. Since toddlers are a subset of children, the first statement confirms that there are indeed children playing, specifically in a water fountain. In conclusion, when given the scenario \\"Two toddlers are playing in a water fountain,\\" it confirms that \\"There are children playing\\" as toddlers fall under the category of children. Thus, both the statements are related, and the first statement provides more specific information about the children (toddlers), the activity (playing), and the location (a water fountain)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Indian Rebellion of 1857 The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India during 1857--58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The event is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and India's First War of Independence. Is this statement correct \\"is the revolt of 1857 the first war of independence\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"is the revolt of 1857 the first war of independence?\\" could be seen as both correct and incorrect depending on one's perspective and interpretation of the events. There are differing opinions among historians and scholars regarding the classification of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as the first war of independence. On one hand, considering it the first war of independence may be accurate, as the 1857 rebellion was indeed a significant and widespread armed uprising against British rule in India. The revolt consisted of Indian soldiers, known as sepoys, various regional chieftains, everyday citizens, and disaffected nobility, all opposing the British East India Company's rule. The goals of the rebellion aimed to end British control and restore traditional Indian political and social order, which could be considered as a struggle for independence. The reasons behind the rebellion were multifaceted. They included rapid changes in Indian society, culture, and economy imposed by the British through their Western-centric policies, land annexations, economic exploitation, heavy taxation, introduction of modern technologies, the decline of traditional Indian institutions, and a sense of growing disillusionment with British rule among both the Indian elite and common people. Additionally, the immediate cause of the rebellion could be traced to the grievances of the sepoys, particularly the introduction of the new Enfield rifle cartridge, rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat, which was offensive to both Hindu and Muslim soldiers. In this sense, the Indian Rebellion of 1857 can be seen as an early attempt to liberate India from British colonial rule, representing a collective desire for autonomy and self-governance, thus justifying its title as the \\"first war of independence.\\" On the other hand, there are various arguments that challenge the notion of the 1857 rebellion as the first war of independence. Some historians argue that the rebellion was not a unified nationalistic struggle as it lacked a coherent leadership, widespread support among all sections of Indian society, and a clear vision of a post-rebellion India. Others emphasize that the revolt was primarily driven by the grievances of specific social, religious, and regional groups, rather than a united quest for Indian independence. Moreover, prior to the events of 1857, there were already smaller instances of resistance against British rule, such as the Sannyasi Rebellion (late 18th century), the First Anglo-Maratha War (1777-1783), and the Paika Rebellion (1817). These uprisings, though not on the same scale as the Revolt of 1857, incorporate elements of anti-colonial resistance deserving recognition. In summary, whether the Indian Rebellion of 1857 is considered the first war of Indian independence or not largely depends on one's interpretation. While it was a significant uprising against British rule with certain elements fighting for self-governance and autonomy, it is essential to acknowledge other, earlier instances of resistance, and the fragmented nature of the rebellion when considering its classification as the first war of independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Tammy Hughes PUBLISHED: 03:54 EST, 22 May 2012 | UPDATED: 08:56 EST, 22 May 2012 These futuristic graphics look more like something from a Star Trek film than pictures of a shopping centre. But the astonishing images are in fact an artist's impression of the future Westfield mega-mall at the World Trade Center in New York. The Australian company has announced that they will open a retail centre at the iconic site 13-and-a-half years after the September 11 attacks. Futuristic: An artist's impression of the Westfield shopping mall at the World Trade Center in New York Enormous: A total shopping space of 352,000 sq feet would be spread over three above-ground levels and two below ground The above-ground retail will be housed in 4 World Trade Center, which is under construction, and inside 3","completion":"World Trade Center, which is yet to be built. Construction projects of this scale require an immense amount of planning and coordination not only in terms of architecture and engineering, but also in terms of economic viability, environment impact, and socio-cultural considerations. This is especially true for the construction site at the World Trade Center, being a location of historical and emotional significance not only for New Yorkers but the entire world. The concept design as seen in the artist's impression holds a futuristic vision that seamlessly merges the characteristics of modern architecture with the functionalities of a retail space. This high-tech vision brings to mind the cutting-edge technology and sleek designs seen in Star Trek films and other works of science fiction. Spread over a total shopping space of 352,000 sq feet with three above-ground levels and two below ground, this architectural marvel will stand as a landmark of the evolving face of New York City. This is symbolic of the city's resilience and capacity for growth and innovation following the tragic events of the September 11 attacks. The Westfield mega-mall will be situated in 4 World Trade Center, a building currently under construction, and inside 3 World Trade Center which is yet to be built. These are extremely important elements of this grand project that demonstrate how futuristic visions can be integrated into the already existing city framework, symbolizing a simultaneous respect for the past and a push towards the future. The Australian company, Westfield Corporation, known for its successful shopping centres globally, is undertaking the shopping center development at the World Trade Center site. This announcement comes 13-and-a-half years after the September 11 attacks showing a belief in recovery, resilience, and remembrance. When completed, the mall could potentially become an international symbol of defiance against terrorism, and a testament to the power of resilience. It will not only be a commercial center for city dwellers and tourists, but it could also serve as a hub for community events, cultural gatherings, and perhaps even become a beacon of technological advancements in the commercial real estate sector. However, large-scale projects like this also come with numerous challenges including environmental impact, technical complexities, and potential disruption to the community. The journey to the completion of the mega-mall therefore will not only be a test of advanced architectural and engineering prowess but also a showcase of efficient project management, stakeholder coordination, and a deep understanding of social dynamics and local culture. All in all, this futuristic retail space promises to add a vibrant chapter to the story of New York City, inviting the world to participate in the city's ongoing journey of evolution and innovation. The implementation of this project will undeniably encounter numerous challenges and there will be plenty of lessons to learn. Nonetheless, one thing is for certain, it will stand as a testament to the spirit of humanity's resilience, its capacity for progress, and hope for a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - Greenwich Village, often referred to by locals as simply \\"the Village\\", is a neighborhood on the west side of Lower Manhattan, New York City. Greenwich Village has been known as an artists' haven, the Bohemian capital, the cradle of the modern LGBT movement, and the East Coast birthplace of both the Beat and '60s counterculture movements. \\"Groenwijck\\", one of the Dutch names for the village (meaning \\"Green District\\"), was Anglicized to \\"Greenwich\\". Two of New York's private colleges, New York University (NYU) and the New School, are located in Greenwich Village. - The Byrds were an American rock band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member, until the group disbanded in 1973. Although they only managed to attain the huge commercial success of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Rolling Stones for a short period in late 1965, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be one of the most influential bands of the 1960s. Initially, they pioneered the musical genre of folk rock, melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music. As the 1960s progressed, the band was also influential in originating psychedelic rock, raga rock, and country rock. - \`\` Triad '' is a song written by David Crosby in 1967 about a ménage à trois , a subject perfectly in keeping with the \`\` free love '' hippie philosophies of the day .

'' However , this has since been denied by Hillman who has stated \`\` I do n't think it was a moral decision . The song just did n't work that well . David was drifting and bored and wanted to do something else , and that song just added fuel to the fire . '' There had been growing animosity between Crosby and the rest of the band throughout 1967 . Tensions had arisen from several factors , including Crosby 's displeasure over the band 's wish to record the Goffin -- King composition \`\` Goin ' Back '' , his fraternization with fellow L.A. musicians , and his controversial remarks to the audience during The Byrds ' performance at the Monterey Pop Festival . These factors , along with the discord over \`\` Triad '' , contributed to McGuinn and Hillman 's decision to fire Crosby in October 1967 . Crosby gave the song to Jefferson Airplane , who recorded it on their 1968 album , Crown of Creation . A live recording of \`\` Triad '' was later included on Crosby , Stills , Nash & Young 's 1971 album , 4 Way Street . The song 's lyrics were largely inspired by the sexual freedom that Crosby enjoyed at his home in Beverly Glen in Los Angeles . However , the song also features allusions to author Robert A. Heinlein 's science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land , with references to \`\` sister lovers '' and \`\` water brothers '' . \`\` Triad '' ,... - The Flying Burrito Brothers was an American country rock band, best known for their influential 1969 debut album, \\"The Gilded Palace of Sin\\".

Pop and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, and the Animals were at the forefront of the invasion. - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Ian Stewart (piano), Bill Wyman (bass) and Charlie Watts (drums). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Other touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (196782), Billy Preston (through the mid 1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982-present). The band was first led by Jones, but after teaming as the band's songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles. - Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996, the band rose to international fame with their debut album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" (2000), which was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other countries. Their following studio album \\"Meteora\\" continued the band's success, topping the \\"Billboard\\" 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart. In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1. In 2014, the band was declared as the \\"Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now\\" by \\"Kerrang!\\". - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements. - Folk rock is a musical genre combining elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest and narrowest sense, the term referred to a genre that arose in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. The genre was pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation. The term \\"folk rock\\" was coined by the U.S. music press to describe the Byrds' music in June 1965, the month in which the band's debut album was issued. - Baroque pop (or baroque rock) is a pop music subgenre that fuses classical music, orchestral pop, rock, and Baroque music. It is identifiable for its use of contrapuntal melodies, functional harmony patterns, and dramatic or melancholic gestures. The genre emerged in the 1960s after pop musicians and record producers began placing the harpsichord in the foreground of their arrangements. Other typical baroque pop instrumentation includes string sections, French horns, and oboes. - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Ingram Cecil Connor III (November 5, 1946 September 19, 1973), known professionally as Gram Parsons, was an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist. Parsons is best known for his work within the country music genre; he also popularized what he called \\"Cosmic American Music\\", a hybrid of country, rhythm and blues, soul, folk, and rock. Besides recording as a solo artist, he played with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds, and The Flying Burrito Brothers. His relatively short career is described by AllMusic as \\"enormously influential\\" for country and rock, \\"blending the two genres to the point that they became indistinguishable from each other.\\" - The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and their friend Al Jardine. They emerged at the vanguard of the \\"California Sound\\", initially performing original surf songs that gained international popularity for their distinct vocal harmonies and lyrics reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance. Rooted in jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and doo-wop, Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to music production, arranging his compositions for studio orchestras, and experimenting with several genres ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and baroque styles. - Gary Usher (December 14, 1938 May 25, 1990) was an American rock musician, songwriter, and record producer. - The Notorious Byrd Brothers is the fifth album by the American rock band The Byrds and was released in January 1968 on Columbia Records (\\"see\\" 1968 in music). Musically, the album represents the pinnacle of The Byrds' psychedelic experimentation, with the band blending together elements of folk rock, psychedelic rock, country music, electronic music, baroque pop and jazz on many of the songs. Of these disparate styles, the subtle country and western influences evident on a number of tracks pointed towards the full-blown country rock direction that the band would pursue on their next album. In addition, \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" saw the band and record producer Gary Usher making extensive use of a number of studio effects and production techniques, including phasing, flanging, and spatial panning. The Byrds also introduced the sound of the pedal steel guitar and the Moog modular synthesizer into their music for the first time on the album, making it one of the first LP releases on which the Moog appears. - Harold Eugene \\"Gene\\" Clark (November 17, 1944 May 24, 1991) was an American singer-songwriter and founding member of the folk rock band the Byrds. He was the Byrds' principal songwriter between 1964 and early 1966, writing most of the band's best-known originals from this period, including \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\", \\"She Don't Care About Time\\", \\"Set You Free This Time\\" , \\"Eight Miles High.\\" Although he did not achieve commercial success as a solo artist, Clark was in the vanguard of popular music during much of his career, prefiguring developments in such disparate subgenres as psychedelic rock, baroque pop, newgrass, country rock, and alternative country. - Guns N' Roses is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles formed in 1985. The lineup, when first signed to Geffen Records in 1986, consisted of vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese, guitarist Richard Fortus and drummer Frank Ferrer. The band has released six studio albums, accumulating sales of more than 100 million records worldwide, including shipments of 45 million in the United States, making Guns N' Roses one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - Polyamory (from Greek ', \\"many, several\\", and Latin ', \\"love\\") is typically the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships where individuals may have more than one partner, with the knowledge and consent of all partners. It has been described as \\"consensual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy\\". However, the meaning of polyamory is also an issue of ongoing debate. For example, although polyamory is typically defined as a relationship practice or approach to relationships, some believe that it should also be considered an orientation or identity (analogous to sexual orientation or gender identity). - Christopher \\"Chris\\" Hillman (born December 4, 1944) is an American musician. He was one of the original members of The Byrds, which in 1965 included Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark, David Crosby and Michael Clarke. With frequent collaborator Gram Parsons, Hillman was a key figure in the development of country rock, defining the genre through his work with The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas and the country-rock group Desert Rose Band. - Country rock is subgenre of popular music, formed from the fusion of rock and country. It was developed by rock musicians who began to record country-flavored records in the late-1960s and early-1970s. These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work. It also played a part in the development of Southern rock. - A ménage à trois (French for \\"household of three\\") is a domestic arrangement in which three people having romantic and/or sexual relations with each other occupy the same household. It is a form of polyamory. - Raga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla. More recently, scholars have included British rock music from the 1960s and 1970s that utilizes South Asian musical materials and instruments and Western ideas of South Asia. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - A hippie (or hippy) is a member of a liberal counterculture, originally a youth movement that started in the United States and the United Kingdom during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The word \\"hippie\\" came from \\"hipster\\" and was initially used to describe beatniks who had moved into New York City's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. The term \\"hippie\\" was first popularized in San Francisco by Herb Caen, who was a journalist for the \\"San Francisco Chronicle\\". - James Roger McGuinn (born James Joseph McGuinn III; July 13, 1942) known professionally as Roger McGuinn and previously as Jim McGuinn, is an American musician.

Pioneering the folk rock genre, Buffalo Springfield, along with the Byrds, combined elements of folk and country music with British invasion influences into their early works. Their second studio album, \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock. - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States.

Selena Gomez came of age in the spotlight, and now the young actress and singer advocates for children as UNICEF's youngest goodwill ambassador. Gomez, 18, has also been involved with CNN Heroes since 2008, when she served as a presenter at \\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute.\\" She recently sat down with CNN Heroes producer Allie Torgan to talk about the Heroes campaign and her humanitarian work. Below are excerpts from that interview. Allie Torgan: Why did you decide to get involved with UNICEF? Selena Gomez: I started working with them for the Trick-or-Treat campaign [a fundraiser where children go door-to-door to collect money on Halloween], and I ended up falling in love with what they do. There's 24,000 children that die a day from preventable causes like malaria, not getting enough food, dirty water, and UNICEF's goal is to make that number zero. They asked me to be their ambassador, so I help them out as much as I can. Torgan: Tell me about your recent mission trip to Ghana. Gomez: UNICEF chose Ghana because of its high child mortality, so we got to see exactly what UNICEF is doing to provide healthy clean water, education, and protect these kids from preventable diseases. I got to see firsthand, and I got to help out myself. It was a really humbling experience for me. I remember a 14-year-old and his friends going to each village, telling everybody how they wanted an education. You think about how many kids hate school here and how much they just wish they didn't have to go to school. You know, I was one of those kids. I complained all the time about having to do homework and I wanted to go out and play, and these kids are begging for school. ... It was so powerful. It makes you more aware of how fortunate you are. There was this little kid playing with a bunch of plastic bags that he wrapped string around, and it was a soccer ball. That's all he needed. And you think about all the Game Boys and all the things that kids \\"need\\" to be entertained here. It was all about simplicity with them. I loved being around them. It got me excited to help more. Torgan: Do you think your work is having an impact with kids here in the U.S.? Gomez: I am very blessed to have a lot of fans, and basically my goal is to use my voice to educate them on all of these things. Kids want to help. You just need to tell them how. And you just need to encourage them. Torgan: How would you describe a hero? Gomez: A hero to me would be someone that truly believes in something. The passion and the drive of wanting to make the world a better place, or to help out and to contribute in some small way, that's a hero to me. Torgan: Back in 2008, you were a presenter at \\"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\\" and you helped honor Maria Ruiz, who helps children in Juarez, Mexico. What was that experience like, and what did you think of her? Gomez: She was so amazing, and she was so sweet. She takes clothes and food across the border, and you could tell that everything that she does, she does because she wants to. But then that night was about her, and I loved that. It was a very good moment. This award show is by far my favorite. It was so cool to see these people that help out and really genuinely care about everything they do. I loved it. I cried so many times, and I met some amazing people, and the whole time I was just very grateful to just be there. I'm looking forward to going again.","completion":"1.

The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images.

Here is a premise: \\"Three women are crossing a street\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The three women are best friends.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise, \\"three women are crossing a street,\\" provides limited information about the relationship between these women. It simply states that they are together at that specific moment, doing a particular activity (i.e., crossing the street). There could be any number of reasons why these women are crossing the street together, such as being strangers who happened to be at the crosswalk at the same time, coworkers going to lunch, or family members. The hypothesis, \\"the three women are best friends,\\" is a possible speculation about the nature of their relationship. However, the premise does not provide enough evidence to confirm or refute this hypothesis. The information given doesn't explicitly mention their friendship or any signs indicating their interpersonal connection. Therefore, we cannot determine the truthfulness of the hypothesis based on the premise alone. To further investigate the hypothesis and establish its validity, more context or specific details about the women's interactions and shared experiences would be needed. For example, if the women were observed engaging in deep conversation, laughing together, or doing other activities that generally suggest a close bond, this might support the hypothesis. Additionally, it is important to consider alternative explanations and hypotheses as well. For instance, the women could all be relatives, colleagues, or members of the same social group or organization, which would provide alternative explanations for their shared presence at the street crossing. In conclusion, although it is plausible that the three women are best friends, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or reject the hypothesis. Additional observations, context, and evidence would be necessary to determine the truthfulness of the hypothesis and better understand the nature of their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person that made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, and the Violin Concerto? From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels.

These plants are characterized by their tall, slender trunks, and large, fan-like leaves. They can be found in various types of habitats, including rainforests, swamps, and coastal regions. Borassodendron palms usually grow in tropical and subtropical areas where the climate is warm, humid, and receives plenty of rainfall. In their natural environments, Borassodendron species can play essential roles in the local ecosystem. Their fruits provide food for various animals, while their trunks and leaves offer shelter or nesting sites for diverse wildlife.

No Plan to Extend Health Care Enrollment Deadline or Delay Mandate WASHINGTON — Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said Wednesday that the Obama administration would not extend the deadline for people to sign up for health insurance or delay the requirement for most Americans to have coverage. And Ms. Sebelius declined to say whether the administration was still committed to its original goal of enrolling seven million people in private coverage through federal and state exchanges by March 31. Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Sebelius said categorically that the administration would not delay the “individual mandate,” under which most Americans must have insurance or pay a tax penalty. In addition, she said that officials would not extend the six-month open enrollment period, scheduled to end on March 31. Ms. Sebelius reported on Tuesday that 4.2 million people had selected health plans through the federal and state exchanges from October through February. Representative James. B. Renacci, Republican of Ohio, noted that the number of sign-ups was well short of the administration’s original goal and asked, “What do you now call success?” Ms. Sebelius declined to reaffirm the goal of seven million and said she would define success as “millions of people having affordable coverage” from private insurers and from Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act is already a success, she said, because the range of private health plans available to consumers is “more robust than ever.” However, a few Democrats expressed disappointment and dismay at the way the health law was being carried out. “So much of the original promise of the Affordable Care Act has been undermined by faulty implementation,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. In Texas, Mr. Doggett said, “more than 90 percent of the people for whom we wrote this law have not been covered.” In parts of the state, he said, it is nearly impossible for consumers to obtain “in-person assistance” in selecting a health plan. So far, according to the latest data from the federal government, 295,000 people in Texas have selected private plans through the federal marketplace. The Times would like to hear from Americans who have signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Sebelius said that state laws and other barriers had made it difficult for some Texans to take advantage of the new insurance options. State officials in Texas, which has the highest uninsured rate of any state, rejected the expansion of Medicaid and declined to establish their own health insurance marketplace. Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, noted that in a special congressional election in Florida this week, the Democratic candidate defended the health care law but said it should be “fixed.” Ms. Sebelius said she was open to possible changes, but had not sent any draft legislation to Congress. However, she said, “We have implemented a number of changes in the way the law was written to ease the transition” for consumers, insurers and employers. Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee, said that, with so many changes and delays by the administration, her constituents were “really confused.” The senior Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, said millions of Americans were benefiting from the new law and its insurance marketplaces. But, he said, “Republicans are so invested in making the Affordable Care Act a failure that they are blinded by the successes staring them in the face.” Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the committee, opened the hearing with a barrage of questions and criticism for Ms. Sebelius. “How much did the failed launch of the exchange cost taxpayers?” Mr. Camp asked. “How many people have actually paid a premium? How many previously uninsured Americans have signed up for Obamacare?” “Increasingly,” Mr. Camp said, “we must ask, ‘When is the next delay or next administrative change in the law coming?’ It seems that not a holiday goes by without a new announcement from the administration that delays some part of Obamacare.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The person in charge of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, said that the Obama administration will not change the deadline for people to sign up for health insurance or the requirement for most Americans to have it. She also didn't say if they still want to get seven million people signed up for health insurance by March 31st. So far, 4.2 million people have signed up for health plans. Some people are disappointed with how the new health care law is working, but Ms. Sebelius says it is already successful because there are many good private health plans available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The five include two police officers and three government officials who were arrested earlier this month They are facing various charges, including manslaughter and negligence. Prosecutors say the fire at the Virgen de la Asunción shelter began when one of the girls set fire to a mattress after a riot. They had been locked in a room after trying to escape and protesting against overcrowding and alleged sexual abuse by staff. Reports say the capacity of the home in San José Pinula is 400. But that many more children were living there at the time. The officials charged are senior members of social and child protection agencies. Two - Brenda Chaman Pacay and Harold Augusto Flores - are accused of manslaughter, and a third - Gloria Patricia Castro Gutiérrez - of negligence. The police officers - Luis Armando Pérez and Lucinda Marroquín - face abuse charges. The former director of the shelter, the former minister of social welfare and his deputy were charged in April. They were sacked by President Jimmy Morales after the fire on 8 March. The tragedy has put a spotlight on failings in Guatemala's child protection services. Months before the tragedy, prosecutors had recommended that the shelter, near Guatemala City, should be closed over allegations of abuse. Mr Morales also called for the shelter's closure, but many Guatemalans have called for his resignation. The shelter takes in children up to the age of 18 who have suffered abuse or have been abandoned. Local media said the shelter was also functioning as a juvenile detention centre, to which judges were sending adolescents involved in criminal cases. Summary:","completion":"This article focuses on the arrest and subsequent charging of five individuals - two police officers and three government officials - in relation to a fire that took place at the Virgen de la Asunción shelter in San José Pinula, Guatemala. The fire, which prosecutors believe started when one of the girls residing there set fire to a mattress during a riot, led to multiple charges being brought against the five individuals including manslaughter, negligence, and abuse. Amidst allegations of overcrowding, sexual misconduct by the staff, and overall failings of the child protective services, the victims had reportedly been locked in a room after attempting to protest and escape. The shelter, meant to cater to a capacity of 400, allegedly housed many more children at the time of the incident and primarily catered to those who have endured abuse or been abandoned, up to the age of 18. Alongside this, it allegedly functioned as a juvenile detention center to which judges would send adolescents implicated in criminal cases. Those charged, including Brenda Chaman Pacay, Harold Augusto Flores, Gloria Patricia Castro Gutiérrez, Luis Armando Pérez, and Lucinda Marroquín, were members of social and child protection agencies and the police force, held in high regard. Furthermore, the former shelter director, the former minister of social welfare and his deputy were previously charged and dismissed by President Jimmy Morales following the fire on March 8. Despite President Morales's call for the shelter's closure, many Guatemalans have petitioned for his resignation. Previously, prosecutors had recommended the shelter be shut down due to abuse allegations. The tragedy has subsequently cast a harsh light on the inefficacies of Guatemala's child protection services and brought urgent attention to the urgent need for reform in protection agencies and social services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. and the situation: John was studying the characteristics of tropical forests. For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways. Answer the following question: Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","completion":"Ireland would receive less rainfall compared to the tropical forests in Laos. This is because the tropical forests, such as those found in Laos, experience higher levels of insolation and rainfall due to their location near the equator and their exposure to warm, moist air from the ocean. These conditions lead to a longer growing season and greater biomass productivity, as well as greater chemical weathering rates. In contrast, temperate forests like those found in Ireland receive comparatively less rainfall and insolation due to the country's higher latitude and more variable climate influenced by the Atlantic Ocean. The temperate forests experience milder, wetter winters and cooler summers compared to tropical forests, resulting in a shorter growing season and less overall rainfall throughout the year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following passage \\"In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at Donauwörth on the 17th to find the Grande Armée in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by 75 miles (121 km) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops.

In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver. He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of Eckmühl.

Write a title for this article: PHILADELPHIA — As Denver Coach Bill Tierney slowly made his way toward his jubilant players, somebody handed him a pair of scissors, then a snipped piece of net and then the national championship trophy, which he held in his arms, reluctantly, for about five seconds. This was Tierney’s seventh go-round atop lacrosse’s coveted pedestal, and he was focused on his players, who were soaking in their first. As Tierney embraced the sophomore defenseman Christian Burgdorf, Tierney asked him how it felt. “The best,” Burgdorf said. “The best.” With an authoritative 10-5 win over Maryland at Lincoln Financial Field on Monday, Tierney and the Pioneers created a transformative moment for a sport that has been gaining westward momentum for years: Never in the 44-year history of the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s lacrosse tournament had a non-East Coast team won the title. What lacrosse’s evolution needed, perhaps, was a breakthrough win, which the trailblazing Tierney helped provide, with the Pioneers beating the defensive-minded Terrapins at their own game and extending Maryland’s title drought to 40 years. The new epicenter of lacrosse is now in a state better known for snowboarding, long home runs and Peyton Manning. But for Tierney, who won his first six national titles at Princeton, this win still felt like a long time coming. “I feel like we were carrying a burden around,” said Tierney, who joined Denver in 2009. “And now it’s off. And now we move on.” That burden was the disappointment of having reached the Final Four three times in the previous four years without advancing to the title game. Tierney relished the strides his program had made; Denver had never won an N.C.A.A. tournament game before he arrived. But he ached for another chance at a title. “It still kind of gets to you,” he said. “It’s still there.” No other coach has claimed as many rings, and no other coach has won titles with two programs. But Monday’s game also signaled to other coaches and administrators that Tierney’s stunning decision to move west was not as preposterous as it once might have appeared. “I hope it gives some athletic directors some courage and some school presidents some courage,” Tierney said. “This is a sport that’s here to stay. This is a sport that means something in our country.” Denver (17-2) never trailed after the senior attacker Wesley Berg scored three goals in the opening 10 minutes to give the team a 3-1 lead. Goalie Ryan LaPlante — wearing his customary gray sweatpants even though the temperature was in the mid-80s — made four of his game-high 11 saves in the opening quarter. After Denver slipped past top-seeded Notre Dame in overtime on Saturday, Trevor Tierney, the coach’s son and an assistant coach for the team, urged the players to remain subdued. A goalie on the title-winning 2001 Princeton team, he saw what happened the next year, when the Tigers lost in the championship game to Syracuse. Instead of celebrating, the Pioneers remained focused on completing their task. The coaching staff drew up a 12-page scouting report. The players slept late and dined at Terminal Market. “The guys were really loose yesterday,” Trevor Tierney said. “It was almost worrisome.” Trailing by 4-1 in the second quarter, Maryland settled in, scoring twice to cut Denver’s lead to 5-3. As time wound down in the half, Maryland’s Henry West had a decent look, but his shot was stymied by LaPlante, who rapped his stick against his chest as time expired. “He played great,” Maryland Coach John Tillman said of LaPlante. “I think if we had hit a couple of those and closed the gap, maybe we could have gotten some momentum.” The Terrapins led Division I in goals allowed (6.9 per game) this season, but their unfamiliarity with Denver’s attack made things difficult. The slippery Berg finished with five goals and was recognized as the tournament’s most outstanding player. The game was expected to have few and precious possessions, placing a premium on the afternoon-long battle at midfield between the face-off specialist Trevor Baptiste of Denver and Charlie Raffa of Maryland. Baptiste, a freshman who led the nation in winning percentage this season, and Raffa, a senior, ripped and plowed for each possession, a game within the game. Baptiste won 10 of 19 face-offs, including the one that tipped the balance with 32 seconds remaining, signaling to Denver’s bench that it could start celebrating. Bill Tierney will mark the achievement by hitting the road to recruit again in about a week, Trevor Tierney said. They will push deeper into places like California, Oregon and Washington, where lacrosse is still increasing in popularity at an impressive clip. They will point to Colorado, that outlier on the map of lacrosse’s winning programs, which for so long could be represented by only a handful of Eastern states. Bill Tierney was speaking about himself, about his decision to leave Princeton, but he could have been remarking about lacrosse in general when he said, “It was time for something different.” A version of this article appears in print on May 26, 2015, on page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: A Coach Reaffirms His Standing as Denver Breaks New Ground.

Question: Reed started studying protozoa and was more interested in the predatorial behaviors of protozoa, while Brad wanted to know more about other types of protozoa, suck as grazers and decomposers. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person learned less about protozoa that graze on algae? Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Reed was more focused on studying the predatory behaviors of protozoa, while Brad was more interested in learning about other types of protozoa, such as grazers and decomposers. Given that herbivorous protozoa are the ones that graze on algae, it would be accurate to say that Reed learned less about protozoa that graze on algae compared to Brad. To elaborate further, protozoa occupy various positions in the food chain and play different roles as consumers. Reed's research focused primarily on the predatory aspect of protozoa, wherein they prey on other single-celled organisms like bacteria. This predation is essential in regulating bacterial populations and maintaining a balanced ecosystem. On the other hand, Brad was interested in exploring other types of protozoa beyond the predators, which included grazers and decomposers. Grazers are herbivorous protozoa that feed directly on algae, thus making them primary consumers in the food chain. Decomposers, as the name suggests, are responsible for breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. In contrast to Reed's focus on predatory protozoa, Brad's research encompassed a wider range of protozoan roles and interactions within their environment. With his interest in grazers and decomposers, Brad would have undoubtedly learned more about protozoa that graze on algae – the herbivorous ones – as opposed to Reed, whose primary focus was on protozoan predators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"The man kicked the ball\\" can be assessed by analyzing its structural, lexical, and semantic coherence within the domain of English language. 1. Structural Coherence: The sentence follows the basic rules of English grammar and syntax, establishing a structurally coherent statement. In terms of sentence constituents, it contains a subject (\\"The man\\"), a verb (\\"kicked\\"), and an object (\\"the ball\\"), arranged in a typical subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern common to English declarative sentences. This pattern facilitates a clear understanding of the intended message. 2. Lexical Consistency: The lexical items used in the sentence are consistent within the English language. \\"Man,\\" \\"kicked,\\" and \\"ball\\" are readily recognizable English words, each with established meanings. \\"The\\" is a definite article that specifies the noun it precedes, conveying uniqueness or previously known entities (in this case, \\"the man\\" and \\"the ball\\"). \\"Kicked\\" is a transitive verb with a clear lexical meaning in the context of action. The combination of these words in the sentence showcases lexical consistency in the expression. 3. Semantic Coherence: Semantically, the sentence is coherent and meaningful. The action of a man kicking a ball is something that is easily understood and visualized by an English speaker. It presents a clear, focused, and plausible scenario rooted in everyday experiences. The relationships between the sentence constituents (i.e., subject, verb, and object) signal a logical sequence of actions that contribute to the overall comprehensibility of the message. 4. Pragmatic Aspects: Although there is limited context provided in terms of speaker intention, presupposition, or broader situational context, the sentence itself can still be regarded as having linguistic integrity due to its grammatical, lexical, and semantic coherence. However, it is important to note that further pragmatic analysis might be required to understand the speaker's meaning or intention in using this sentence within a specific communicative situation. In conclusion, the sentence \\"The man kicked the ball\\" can be considered as having linguistic integrity in terms of its adherence to the grammatical rules, lexical consistency, and semantic coherence within the framework of the English language. However, a more nuanced understanding of its pragmatic implications may require additional contextual information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: CIA interrogations report: New Congress must tackle how to get intelligence right. As I read news reports detailing the Senate Committee Report on the CIA interrogation program after the September 2001 terrorist attacks , I concluded there are several recurring problems to this latest effort to govern our national intelligence agencies . As an old man, I have had the opportunity to have first-hand exposure to how complex it is for Congress or even the White House to assert control over these vital intelligence activities . After there were revelations in the 60's that the CIA had engaged in a variety of activities that were highly questionable including efforts to kill Fidel Castro and others , the Carter administration reacted and went through the kind of political process that many are urging should be done today . In an attempt to purge the agency of its tendency to use nefarious individuals to carry out some of its covert projects, the CIA was directed to refuse to associate with any persons who could not meet the test of good character . One CIA officer told me how absurd that directive was . \\"We are trying to get people to betray their governments and to lie and cheat on our behalf. You cannot expect us to find those people in the front pew at the local churches.\\" Perhaps the directive was well-intentioned but it made no sense . Richard Helms, the CIA head from 1966 to 1973, whom I knew well and admired greatly, told me of his personal problems when he was indicted by the Carter Justice Department for perjury . In testimony he gave to the Congress, Helms denied under oath his agency had been involved in the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile, an action ordered by President Nixon . Helms told me he was following instructions he had been given repeatedly by various Senators including such powerful men as Senators Richard Russell and Walter George to the effect that if he were ever asked at an open hearing a question the answer to which \\"would put any of our people at risk\\" he should feel free to protect the secrets in whatever manner he wished . Of course Helms knew of many instances when he and others in the Agency had relied on that authority . Helms was defended by the powerful Washington lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams and the case against Helms was quickly resolved when Williams explained to the Justice Department his plan to have Helms take the stand and recite all the covert programs that had been protected by various forms of prevarications by intelligence officials . Of course no such trial in public made any sense and the danger to ongoing intelligence activities of testimony such as Williams would have had Helms provide was so great the ill- advised indictment of Helms resulted only in a slap on the wrist . Williams made a deal in which Helms pled guilty to a misdemeanor with no punishment . Later , President Ronald Reagan gave Helms the National Intelligence Medal as an obvious act of apology . Perjury is not to be condoned and lying before the Congress is criminal conduct . But the intelligence world involves subtle issues . If we want to have a major intelligence effort , there are clear costs to be accepted . One of them is that much of the necessary supervision by Congress has to be done with deft caution . It can hardly be conducted in open hearings . Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law Professor and prominent civil libertarian, contends torture to save lives should be permitted as long as there are rigorous procedural safeguards . He points out the Israelis have used torture for years with apparent success . Getting information from unwilling prisoners cannot be done without some risks to civilized process . It can be a dirty game . I once visited Vice President Walter Mondale at his White House office where he served under President Carter from 1977 to 1981 . His desk was piled high with documents he said were mainly reports from the CIA . He volunteered his frustration at the then weaknesses at the CIA . He told me he had come to regret he had been such a vigorous supporter of the gutting of that agency that followed the suggestions of the so-called Church Committee on which Mondale had served as a Senator . His comment was an isolated one and I merely listened . But the effects of the Church Committee recommendations were damaging to the CIA and the remedial work took years . Every forty years we may have to endure periodic reports like those produced under Senators Church and Feinstein that represent well intentioned reviews of the intelligence community . The suggested reforms speak of following our sense of justice and fairness and civility . The problem is obvious : Our enemies do not play fair and war is Hell . Any reforms of the intelligence universe cannot easily be effected . The idea of a transparent intelligence agency is an inherent contradiction . Moreover how can Congress talk openly of reforms without damaging our intelligence efforts? And politicians are among those least likely to be willing to accept the secrecy that is at the core of any well managed intelligence agency . Can we imagine a Congress that can keep the secrets? The new flurry of attacks on the intelligence community -- harmful and unnecessary-- will not have any more lasting impact than did the indictment of Helms or the work of the Church Committee . But there should be some quiet and thoughtful debate within our Congress about how it can supervise these vital intelligence programs . After all , our national intelligence work is existential .

Fatty acids are broken down to acetyl-CoA by means of beta oxidation inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, but also in the reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with oxaloacetate, to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the oxaloacetate molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into oxaloacetate from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.

Given the following context: Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne.

At the age of six months she was acquired, along with her sister, by John Ashley, a wealthy Massachusetts slaveholders. She became known as \\"Mumbet\\" or \\"Mum Bett.\\" For nearly 30 years Mumbet served the Ashley family. One day, Ashley's wife tried to strike Mumbet's sister with a spade. Mumbet protected her sister and took the blow instead. Furious, she left the house and refused to come back. When the Ashleys tried to make her return, Mumbet consulted a lawyer, Theodore Sedgewick. With his help, Mumbet sued for her freedom. While serving the Ashleys, Mumbet had listened to many discussions of the new Massachusetts constitution. If the constitution said that all people were free and equal, then she thought it should apply to her. Eventually, Mumbet won her freedom---- the first slave in Massachusetts to do so under the new constitution. Strangely enough, after the trial, the Ashleys asked Mumbet to come back and work for them as a paid employee. She declined and instead went to work for Segdewick. Mumbet died in 1829, but her legacy lived on in her many descendants . One of her great-grandchildren was W.E.B. Du Bois, one of the founder of the NAACP, and an important writer and spokesperson for African American civil rights. Mumbet's tombstone still stands in the Massachusetts cemetery where she was buried. It reads, in part: \\"She was born a slave and remained a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years. She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.\\" Question: What did Mumbet learn from discussions about the new consititution? Answer: A:","completion":"Mumbet learned from discussions about the new Massachusetts constitution that all people were free and equal. This inspired her to believe that the constitution should apply to her as well, which ultimately led her to sue for her freedom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Connie Ley made an unusual request in her will before she died last month in Aurora, Indiana: She asked that her German shepherd, Bela, be euthanized and buried with her. Three weeks later, however, Bela, who is 9 years old and male, is healthy and very much alive. And there's a growing movement on social media to defy his late owner's wishes and spare the animal. Ley's attorney, Doug Denmure, told CNN affiliate WCPO-TV that his late client preferred to send Bela to Best Friends Animal Society's no-kill sanctuary in southern Utah to live out the remainder of his days. But if transporting the dog across the country proved too expensive, Ley wanted a close friend to take charge of Bela and carry out her request that \\"the dog be put to sleep, cremated and that the dog's ashes be placed with her own ashes.\\" As it turned out, sending Bela to the Utah animal sanctuary was not financially feasible, Denmure told WXIX-TV, another CNN affiliate. But following a public outcry, a decision about the dog's fate has been put on hold for now, he said. Bela was with Ley when she died at home November 25. The dog is now being housed in a special kennel at PAWS of Dearborn County Humane Center in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Director Becky Foster said the center has no legal control over the dog's future and is waiting to hear from Ley's attorney. \\"He's been cared for very well,\\" Foster told CNN on Thursday. \\"We're happy to have him here as long as need be. He has toys and blankies and he's just chilling.\\" Meanwhile, animal lovers on Facebook and Twitter are urging that Bela be spared, calling Ley's decision selfish. Supporters have mounted an online petition to save the dog and are rallying around a #SaveBela hashtag. \\"Add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt Bela and give her a happy home. Please #SaveBela from her dead owner's stupidity,\\" one woman wrote. Best Friends Animal Society also has weighed in, posting a statement on its Facebook page urging fans to share #SaveBela messages. \\"We want to save Bela's life and bring him to our sanctuary, but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands,\\" said the post. \\"The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley's will and we are hopeful that she will agree.\\" Denmure maintains that everything about Ley's request is legal. \\"The dog was owned by my client and now it's part of her estate,\\" he told WCPO. \\"And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client's will and impose what they want.\\" Denmure said Ley didn't trust Bela to be around others and the 105-pound dog has a history of aggressive behavior. He told WCPO that a veterinarian recommended Bela be put down. \\"He could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers, in particular, children.\\" The case has raised ethical questions about how much control deceased people should have over the life of their pets. \\"On the whole, we don't allow people to euthanize healthy pets,\\" said Edward Queen, a professor of ethics at Emory University. On the other hand, he said, it's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized. \\"As a matter of policy, do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim?\\" he pondered. \\"Assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for, I'm not sure we want to encourage this.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"A lady named Connie Ley passed away last month and she had a German shepherd dog named Bela. Before she died, she requested in her will that her dog be euthanized, which means to put to sleep forever, and be buried with her.

Connie had wanted Bela to go to a no-kill sanctuary for dogs in Utah, but it was too expensive to send him there. So, she asked a close friend to take care of her request instead. Right now, Bela is staying at an animal shelter while people decide what to do. Many people on social media, like Facebook and Twitter, are urging that the dog should be saved and are using the hashtag #SaveBela. Even the sanctuary in Utah wants to save Bela's life, but it's up to the person Connie named in her will.

Indigenous peoples of Mexico (Spanish: pueblos indigenas de Mexico), Native Mexicans (Spanish: nativos mexicanos), or Mexican Native Americans (Spanish: nativo america mexicanos), are those who are part of communities that trace their roots back to populations and communities that existed in what is now Mexico prior to the arrival of Europeans. According to the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (Comision Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indigenas, or CDI in Spanish) and the INEGI (official census institute), in 2015, 25,694,928 people in Mexico self-identify as being indigenous of many different ethnic groups, which constitute 21.5% of Mexico's population. According to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \\"usos y costumbres\\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law. The indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatan Peninsula. According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatan, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosi and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups. What are some other statistics that are relevant to the indigenous people of Mexico?","completion":"Alright, imagine Mexico as a big neighborhood with lots of different families living in it. Some of these families have been living there for a very, very long time, even before other people came from far away to visit. These families that have been there for a very long time are called indigenous peoples. They come from many different groups, and they each have their own way of speaking, dressing, and doing things. In the whole neighborhood of Mexico, about 21.5% of all people say they are from these indigenous families. That's about 25,694,928 people! These families are growing, and more and more people are saying they are a part of these groups because they feel proud of their roots. These indigenous families usually live in smaller towns or villages. But some of them live in bigger cities too, especially in places like Mexico City, Puebla, and the Yucatan Peninsula. Different states in Mexico have more indigenous families than others. The ones with the most indigenous people are Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Campeche, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Hidalgo, Puebla, Guerrero, San Luis Potosi and Veracruz.

A. stress B. understand themselves C. pleasure D. sense of joy E. debt The best answer is Answer:","completion":"C. pleasure Opening a gift that one has carefully chosen and given to someone else during Christmas can bring an immense sense of pleasure and satisfaction to the gift giver. This pleasure stems from the joy of seeing a positive reaction from the gift recipient, the expression of gratitude, and the knowledge that one has made their loved one happy. While other options like stress (A), understanding themselves (B), a sense of joy (D), or debt (E) might be experienced during the process of buying and giving Christmas presents, the act of seeing someone open a received gift evokes a clear and undeniable sense of pleasure for the giver. The pleasure experienced while giving a gift during Christmas celebrations is due to a combination of various factors. First, gift-giving is a universally acknowledged expression of love, care, and thoughtfulness. In many cultures, including Western traditions, Christmas is an occasion to demonstrate these emotions and forge stronger bonds with one's family members and friends. Thus, when someone sees their gift being opened by the receiver, the giver feels a sense of accomplishment and contentment for successfully expressing their feelings through the gesture. Second, the happiness of the gift recipient is contagious. As humans, experiencing the joy of others can often incite exhilarating and uplifting emotions within us. Therefore, witnessing someone's delight upon opening a Christmas present can elicit deep feelings of pleasure in the giver. Additionally, Christmas is a time when altruistic behavior is encouraged, and the spirit of giving is celebrated. When someone gives a gift, they might feel a sense of personal growth, as they have acted with generosity and kindness. This feeling of self-betterment further contributes to the pleasure experienced by the gift giver. Lastly, it's important to note that humans are social creatures, and the act of giving – particularly during festive occasions such as Christmas – reinforces social connections and the sense of belonging to a community. Therefore, seeing a loved one open a gift and appreciating the effort strengthens the relationship between the giver and the receiver, ultimately bringing greater pleasure to both parties. In summary, the best answer to the question of what seeing someone open a gift after buying Christmas presents causes for the gift giver is pleasure (C). This pleasure stems from the successful expression of love and care, the contagious joy of the recipient, feelings of self-betterment through generous acts, and the reinforcement of social bonds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on this statement, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) reports directly to the President. However, the President has many other direct reports besides the Director of National Intelligence, including the Vice President and the heads of executive departments that make up the President's Cabinet, such as the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Treasury, and Attorney General, among others. Other key direct reports to the President include the White House Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, though the list goes beyond these positions as well. It is essential to consider that the president's direct reports form an extensive network of individuals responsible for essential aspects of government functioning, and all of them play a critical role in ensuring smooth governance and execution of responsibilities. These individuals report to the President on their respective policy issues to keep the President informed and facilitate decision-making on vital matters related to national security, the economy, domestic policies, and foreign affairs.

Q:Article: In May, 2014, some Chinese tourists found a Chinese-character message \\"Ding Jinhao once visited here\\" on a statue of god in a 3500-year-old Egyptian temple. An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \\"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper. With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: \\"Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad.\\" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media. On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. \\"The boy has known his mistake and cried all night. He has to be moved around because reporters rushes to his house for interviews.\\" said a reporter who talked with the parents. Question: The passage is mainly about _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\" is appropriate for what the passage is mainly about. The passage primarily discusses a particular event in which a Chinese teenager, Ding Jinhao, defaced a 3500-year-old statue in an Egyptian temple by inscribing Chinese characters on it, translating to \\"Ding Jinhao was here\\". This incident caused widespread outrage and provoked considerable backlash, not just from people in Egypt who were understandably upset about the defacement of their historical monument, but also within China and the larger global community. The incident instigated a widespread discussion on uncivilized behavior, more specifically, of Chinese tourists. The discussion was amplified by the fact that China, in recent years, have seen a significant increase in outbound tourism due to its booming economy. The Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang’s reference to the \\"uncivilized behavior of some tourists\\" further elevates this point. This incident influenced a collective introspection within China about the behavior and manners of its citizens abroad, underlining that the actions of one individual can affect a country's reputation as a whole. The ensuing social consequences for the teenager and his family, who became the targets of public shaming and harassment, were also part of the wave caused by this uncivilized behavior. This case highlighted the extent of public anger towards such actions but also raised ethical issues about how the boy's personal information was exposed and used, and the potential impact on his future development. The wave generated by the uncivilized behavior of Ding Jinhao was indeed extensive, affecting political, social, and personal spheres, domestically and internationally, and sparked a vital discussion on tourist manners, national reputation, and privacy ethics. Furthermore, this incident resulted in renewed calls for better tourist education and manners. Thus, the phrase \\"the wave caused by Chinese uncivilized behavior\\" aptly summarizes the main focus of the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Avery Ludlow (Brian Cox) is a 60-something widower who owns a small-town general store and lives with a 14-year-old mongrel dog named Red. (The dog was a gift from Ludlow's wife, who was murdered shortly afterward by their emotionally troubled son.)While taking a day off from work to go fishing, Ludlow and Red are met on the lakeshore by a deer-hunting trio of teenagers: Danny, his brother Harold, and their friend Pete (Noel Fisher, Kyle Gallner, and Shiloh Fernandez). Their conversation is at first friendly, but turns increasingly menacing as Danny - a swaggering bully - points his shotgun at Ludlow and demands money. Ludlow offers Danny the keys to his pickup truck, and says there's 20 or 30 dollars in his wallet in the glove box. Danny is disgusted at the small pickings, and on an impulse turns his shotgun toward Red, shooting him in the head. The boys walk away from the man and his dying dog, Danny and Pete laughing about it while Harold seems shaken and embarrassed.Ludlow takes his dog home and buries him. He learns Danny McCormack's identity by tracking down where he bought the shotgun. He goes to Danny's home and confronts the boy's father (Tom Sizemore), a wealthy businessman with political connections. Ludlow demands that McCormack discipline his son for what he did. McCormack summons his two sons, but they deny the incident happened. McCormack says Ludlow has the wrong culprits, and sends him away. Ludlow goes to his lawyer, who says even if the boys were tried and convicted of the crime, it is at best a 200-dollar fine and a few days in jail. The lawyer introduces Ludlow to Carrie (Kim Dickens), a TV reporter, who persuades him to let her do a feature story on the killing.What follows is an escalating cycle of hostilities between Ludlow and the McCormacks. After the TV story is aired, a rock is thrown through Ludlow's window, with a note saying he won't be on TV again. The next day Carrie's boss pulls her from the story.

Question: Given the following passage \\"Scientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university. During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\", answer the following question.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. I am facing a new situation today: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify key information from the background article The background article states that in physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. Conversely, when particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. Step 2: Apply this information to the new situation In the new situation, David is teaching school children about two particles of matter - particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, while particle B moves slower. Step 3: Compare the particles' movements to their temperatures Based on the information from the background article, the particle that moves more quickly (particle A) will have a higher temperature due to its greater kinetic energy. The particle that moves more slowly (particle B) will have a lower temperature because it has less kinetic energy. Step 4: Answer the question Given the information provided, we can confidently answer that particle B would have a lower temperature since it moves slower compared to particle A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What are the official languages of the dominican republic? Answer:","completion":"The Dominican Republic, located in the Caribbean region and sharing the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, has a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. The Dominican Republic's official language is Spanish; however, the country is home to a diverse population, which has resulted in a beautiful tapestry of languages and dialects being spoken within its borders. Spanish, the official language, is spoken by the vast majority of the population. As a former Spanish colony, the language has been deeply ingrained into the country's cultural fabric, and it is used at all levels of society, including government, education, media, and business. The Spanish spoken in the Dominican Republic is primarily influenced by Andalusian and Canarian dialects from Spain, along with African and indigenous linguistic elements. This unique blend has given rise to the Dominican Spanish, which is characterized by distinct accents, vocabulary, and expressions that can vary by region. In addition to Spanish, several other languages and dialects are spoken in the Dominican Republic, owing to the country's diverse background. These languages are not official, but still hold importance in the lives of many Dominicans and contribute to the country's multicultural heritage. Some of these languages include: 1. Haitian Creole: It is the main language spoken by the Dominican Republic's Haitian population and their descendants. Haitian Creole is a French-based Creole language with influences from West African languages, Spanish, Taino, and other Amerindian languages. Although not an official language in the Dominican Republic, it is widely spoken in communities near the border shared with Haiti and among Haitian migrants. 2. Samaná English: This is a unique variety of English spoken in the Samaná Peninsula. It developed from a group of African American freed slaves and their descendants, who migrated from the United States to the Dominican Republic in the early 19th century. This English dialect is vibrant, with lexical and grammatical elements from West African languages interwoven with American English and has managed to survive despite isolation and the predominance of Spanish. 3. Dominican Sign Language: The deaf community in the Dominican Republic uses this sign language as their primary means of communication. It evolved independently and is distinct from American Sign Language, although there have been some contacts and exchanges between the two. 4. Indigenous & Minority Languages: The Dominican Republic has a small but significant presence of indigenous peoples, primarily Taino Arawakan descendants. While the original Taino language is considered extinct, some language revitalization efforts are underway. Some Taino vocabulary has been preserved in Dominican Spanish, as well as in the names of geographic locations, plants, and animals. Additionally, some Middle Eastern immigrant communities in the country speak Arabic and other languages from that region. In summary, the Dominican Republic's linguistic landscape is diverse and vibrant, with Spanish serving as the official language. Other languages like Haitian Creole, Samaná English, Dominican Sign Language, and various indigenous and minority languages also contribute to the richness of the nation's cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What type of details about steve refenes can be gathered from the following bio?

To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation. In which location the counter gas would be ionized, location B or location C? Hint: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the gas in the Geiger counter would be ionized in location B. Since location B has low radiation, the gas would encounter some radiation that would ionize it and cause the Geiger counter to click, indicating the presence of radiation.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article in one sentence. So many social errors could be avoided if only more thought were involved. A truly gifted conversationalist will always try to filter what he says before he finally says it. While thinking about everything you're going to say may sound exhausting to some, it doesn't require a lot of brainpower. Really, all you'll usually need is a split-second to figure whether something you say might negatively affect someone around you. If you have a bad feeling about saying something, it's best to keep your mouth shut for the time being. It may help to be conscious of the way your voice is sounding when you speak. While it may be distracting to focus on yourself when you're trying to have a conversation, casually keeping track of the tone, speed and volume of your voice can go a long way towards preventing unintentional rudeness. In particular, be careful with your talking speed. Nervous or awkward people tend to accelerate their speech when they're under pressure. This only serves to add to the awkwardness. There's a lot empathy can do for you in a conversation. Being seen as polite and considerate isn't least among the benefits. Empathy is something virtually everyone has to some extent. The key to bringing it out is to invest a legitimate interest in what the other person is saying. If someone is telling you something about his life, make a concerted effort to see things from his point of view. If he recently lost his job, for example, try to empathize with how that might feel. Empathetic people are in tune with the other person's feelings and it's easier to charm them as such. Empathy works in less-than-pleasant interactions as well. It can be frustrating to talk to someone who is being aggressive or mean-spirited. While it can be easy to let loose on someone like that, you can have an easier time keeping calm by using empathy. Try to see the situation from the unpleasant person's point-of-view. In some cases, you may have a new lease on the situation by taking yourself out of your own perspective for a bit. Gossip is a quick route to rudeness. No one likes being talked about. Even if the subject in question isn't around to hear it, many people take offence to hearing people they know talked about in a negative light. If you want to avoid rudeness on your part, you should steer clear of interactions like this. Even if other people are gossiping, you should turn the other cheek. Those who are there to see you refuse the prospect will think more highly of you as a result. Modesty is a virtue for virtually all polite people. Some people are rude for the fact that they focus too much on themselves. This is most often an innocent fault, but it's one that can easily be avoided if you try to look at the conversation from both perspectives. Even if everything you're saying is gold, you'll still come across as rude if you don't think to hear the other person's side of things. As a general rule, people like to voice their opinions. They'll feel constricted if they can't get a word in. Listening is a skill, as real as any other. If you don't want to be rude, you'll need to have a fine command of listening. Active listening refers to a broad range of reactions that let the other person know you are giving him your fullest attention. This can include body language, such as nodding your head, or soft responses like repeating the gist of what the other person said can get this point across. Summary:","completion":"To avoid social errors and rudeness in conversations, practice empathy, be conscious of your tone and talking speed, avoid gossip, practice modesty, and actively listen to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Cezanne, it sells for a fabulous 515,000, the high point of the auction.

The moment she arrives at their elegant old chateau, she runs upstairs calling her father. In his bedroom on the second floor, she opens the door to an antique wardrobe and steps inside, opens a false panel at the back of the wardrobe and climbs a hidden spiral staircase to her father's secret studio in the attic.Bonnet, it turns out, is a forger of fine art...cheerful and charming, but an unrepentant scoundrel. He is putting the finishing touches on his latest project, a flawless rendition of a famous lost Van Gogh. He has even found another painting from the same period, by an unknown artist, and has brushed dirt from the back of that canvas to transfer to his forgery. \\"I doubt if even Van Gogh himself would have gone to such pains with his work,\\" he boasts. \\"He didn't have to, Papa,\\" Nicole retorts, \\"he WAS Van Gogh!\\" She tells him in a tired voice (for what must surely be the thousandth time) that it's a crime to sell fake masterpieces.

Movie title: Into the Blue 2: The Reef Context: On a motorboat traveling off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii, someone is seen dumping two large containers into the ocean and then going to meet with a few guys in business suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers to avoid detection by the police, and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.The next day, Sebastian (Chris Carmack) and his girlfriend Dani (Laura Vandervoort) are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group owns a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients (mostly mainland tourists). Sebastian doesn't want to do this line of work forever. For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure. Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei) and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe), Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to flirt with other women. While Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship, Sebastian and Dani are very much in love.While at work, they are visited by Carlton (David Anders) and Azra (Marsha Thomason), a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the San Cristobal.

So, both Sebastian and Dani willingly agree to help the couple.

Dani, Kimi, Sebastian, and Mace get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions....","completion":"In the movie \\"Into the Blue 2: The Reef,\\" various characters get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions. These competitions are a part of the beach life and recreational activities that the characters indulge in between their diving expeditions in search of the sunken Spanish ship San Cristobal and its treasure. The primary characters that get involved in beach volleyball competitions are: 1. Sebastian (played by Chris Carmack): Sebastian is one of the main protagonists of the movie. He is a passionate treasure hunter, who runs a snorkeling business with his girlfriend, Dani. The beach volleyball competition provides a break from his work and treasure-hunting pursuits. 2. Dani (played by Laura Vandervoort): Dani is Sebastian's girlfriend and the co-owner of the snorkeling business. She is highly supportive of Sebastian's quest for the San Cristobal and joins him in these recreational activities, such as beach volleyball competitions. 3. Mace (played by Michael Graziadei): Mace is a close friend of Sebastian's and an employee at the snorkeling business. He is in a tumultuous relationship with Kimi, and the beach volleyball competitions serve as a way for the two of them to bond and spend time together outside of work. 4. Kimi (played by Mircea Monroe): Kimi is Dani's best friend and Mace's girlfriend. Despite their challenging relationship, Kimi participates in the beach volleyball competitions with the others as a means of relaxation and fun. These four characters, along with others visiting the beach, participate in separate beach volleyball competitions as a form of recreation and bonding. The competitions act as moments of leisure amidst their thrilling and sometimes dangerous treasure-hunting expeditions. These activities showcase the beauty of the beach life in Honolulu, Hawaii, and play a role in developing the relationships and dynamics between the central characters in the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Many of the victims had been headed home for R & R or emergency leave when they were killed .","completion":"While both sentences share some similarities in meaning, there are subtle differences in their scopes and focus. Let's break down each sentence to better understand their meanings. 1. Many of the victims of Sunday's attack had been headed out of Iraq for R & R (Rest and Recuperation) or emergency leave. In this sentence, \\"Many of the victims\\" refers to a significant number of people who were affected by the attack. The focus of this sentence is on their intended action - that is, the victims were attempting to leave Iraq. Their goal was to go for R & R (Rest and Recuperation) or to take emergency leave. The sentence explicitly identifies Sunday's attack as the event that affected these victims and highlights their intention to leave Iraq at that specific moment - which, presumably, is the reason they became victims. 2. Many of the victims had been headed home for R & R or emergency leave when they were killed. In the second sentence, the reference to \\"Many of the victims\\" again signifies a significant number of people who were affected. This time, however, the sentence's focus is on the ultimate outcome - the fact that these people were killed. This sentence also tells us about the victims' intended action: to head home for R & R or emergency leave. Nonetheless, the sentence does not explicitly mention the event (Sunday's attack) that led to the victims' demise; it only indicates that they were killed at the moment they were trying to go home. In summary, both sentences convey that many victims were intending to leave for R & R or emergency leave. The first sentence emphasizes the event (Sunday's attack) and their intention to get out of Iraq, while the second sentence focuses on the fact that they were killed while trying to go home. The two sentences do not necessarily contradict each other, but they provide slightly different perspectives on the same general situation."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Chana Orloff ( 1888 -- 1968 ) was an Israeli Art deco and figurative art sculptor . - Art Deco, or Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. It became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for \\"Arts Décoratifs\\", from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - The International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts was a World's fair held in Paris, France, from April to October 1925. It was designed by the French government to highlight the new \\"style moderne\\" of architecture, interior decoration, furniture, glass, jewelry and other decorative arts in Europe and throughout the world. Many ideas of the international avant-garde in the fields of architecture and applied arts were presented for the first time at the Exposition. The event took place between the esplanade of Les Invalides and the entrances of the Grand Palais and Petit Palais, and on both banks of the Seine. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries; and it was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The \\"Style Moderne\\" presented at the Exposition later became known as \\"Art Deco\\", after the name of the Exposition. - Figurative art, sometimes written as figurativism, describes artworkparticularly paintings and sculpturesthat is clearly derived from real object sources, and is therefore by definition representational. \\"Figurative art\\" is often defined in contrast to abstract art: - Abstract art uses a visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person whose family had strong left-wing political commitments?, using the article: Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff.

The U.S. also negotiated quotas or volume limits on other countries, such as South Korea, Argentina, Australia and Brazil, instead of tariffs, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also told reporters Thursday by telephone. China's foreign ministry said on Friday all countries should protect the normal trade order, when asked about U.S. decision. President Donald Trump said Thursday that the days of the U.S. being taken advantage of in trade deals \\"are over'\\" in a harshly worded statement responding to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's criticism of new steel and aluminum tariffs. He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has set for deciding whether he will run for president in 2016. Rubio is scheduled to huddle with supporters in Miami Beach on Jan. 23 and 24, days that should be circled in red ink on everyone's political calendar. (Surely, the big bosses will want me to stake out that meeting in sunny Florida?) Rubio has been insisting that former Florida governor Jeb Bush's plans to enter the race have no bearing on what he will do. Maybe not. But it probably should. A couple of data points to consider from a few polls: This isn't where Rubio thought he would be two years ago when he was being cast by, well, everyone as the future of the GOP. So what must he and his donors consider as they look at his 2016 prospects? First, what's his path in this crowded field? Republican strategists look at the very full roster of possible candidates and see three camps, some slightly overlapping: the establishment camp, the tea party/libertarian camp and the evangelical camp. Although Rubio has some tea party support, his approach to foreign policy and immigration reform make him a not-perfect fit there. And he is hardly the best fit for the evangelical camp either, despite his efforts at appealing to that group. There is only one savior, and it is not me. #Jesus Which leaves the establishment camp, and the fundraising juggernauts named Bush and Romney. Imagine Rubio in conversations with possible donors. What's his best case for why he is a better investment than Bush or Romney to beat the field and eventually stand onstage with Hillary Clinton? Appeal to Hispanics? Bush has the same argument. Fresh face? Sure. But maybe a little too fresh. He has the Obama problem on that score. And his youth means he has plenty of time. This isn't his last, best chance, like a few others. The best argument to stay on the sidelines is that Rubio's best shot at becoming president, something he clearly wants to become, is his Senate seat. If he runs for president in 2016, that means giving up his launching pad. (He has said he wouldn't run for president and reelection.) It's a risky move. Why make it now? Rubio still has a long runway ahead of him. At 43, he is two decades younger than Bush. He could stay in the Senate for another term, or run for governor in 2018. In 2020 or 2024, he will still be a young man. But one with a longer resume and probably a less chock-full field to deal with. And if Rubio doesn't run for the big office in 2016, he'll be on every potential nominee's VP shortlist. Of course, all of this is subject to change, because politics.
