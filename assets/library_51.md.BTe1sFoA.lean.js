Given the following context: Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding. answer the following question: What is the name of the attack that Terry Nichols helped plan, and for which he is serving life in prison without parole?

Context: The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, “While agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy...

A dual-mass flywheel or DMF is a rotating mechanical device that is used to provide continuous energy (rotational energy) in systems where the energy source is not continuous, the same way as a conventional flywheel acts, but damping any violent variation of torque or revolutions that could cause an unwanted vibration. The vibration reduction is achieved by accumulating stored energy in the two flywheel half masses over a period of time but damped by a series of strong springs, doing that at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing that energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time. A compact dual-mass flywheel often includes the whole clutch, including the pressure plate and the friction disc. See options at the end. Can we conclude that is a flywheel part of a clutch kit? * no * yes","completion":"* yes A dual-mass flywheel (DMF) is a part of a clutch kit. In a compact DMF system, the complete clutch, including the pressure plate and the friction disc, is usually incorporated within the flywheel. This setup helps in reducing the unwanted vibrations caused by sudden changes in torque or revolutions in a mechanical system.

After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would \\"tinker\\" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony,... answer the following question: What was reissued by EMI in the 1970s?

He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\".

Improved digestion: Drinking more water can dilute stomach acids that help break down food, making it easier for the food to pass through the small intestine, where it encounters the pancreatic enzymes. This might result in an overall more efficient digestive process and indirectly reduce the workload on the pancreas. 2. Hydration and enzyme production: Proper hydration is crucial for maintaining overall bodily functions, and it includes the efficient production of hormones and enzymes by the pancreas. Although drinking more water does not directly make the pancreas work \\"softer,\\" it may help the pancreas maintain an optimal production of necessary enzymes and hormones. 3. Blood sugar regulation: When a person drinks more water, it can also affect blood sugar levels, particularly if the liquid consumed has a high sugar content. This increase in blood sugar levels could, in turn, prompt the pancreas to produce more insulin to help regulate those levels. While this may not necessarily be considered as the pancreas working \\"softer,\\" it could be another indirect effect related to liquid intake. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of drinking more liquid does not have a direct effect on the pancreas working softer. However, it can indirectly impact the digestive process and overall pancreatic function by affecting digestion, enzyme production, and blood sugar regulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're hunting on a small body of water where it's not too windy, choose a duck call that isn't too loud, or you'll scare the ducks. A double-reeded wooden call is perfect for the job. On large bodies of water or when it's windy, you need a loud duck call. An acrylic call would be more appropriate. If you only have one call, vary your calls to compensate. Remember: accuracy is the most important thing. Watch the ducks for reactions to your calls. Calls are to be employed when you've spotted a group of ducks flying overhead and you want to attract them to land as close as possible to your position. Calls are most effective when they're used sparingly, and they must be done correctly if you hope to fool the ducks. Watch the ducks for their reaction to your calls. If you see them flying over-head and change their direction to your position, don't keep skronking away at full-tilt and risk ruining your cover. Wait for them and see what they do. If you're calling more than once in 30 seconds, you're probably calling too much. If you're listening to Waylon on the portable radio super-loud, your whistles will make poor accompaniment. If you're hunting with decoys and the ducks are clearly attracted to them, don't risk ruining a good opportunity by blowing your lungs out. Ducks will often swoop around, dive, leave, come back and land several times before they decide to jump in front of your sights. Be consistent, avoid frustration, and wait. Listen to commercial CDs of duck calls. Listen and practice at home or in the car. Also spend time listening to real ducks in the wild. While you're calling, you should be actively listening to the sounds the real ducks are making so you can imitate them in response. Wooden duck calls especially will need drying out and wiping down after use, so the wood finish won't wear and crack. Unscrew the reeds and check to make sure they haven't broken or chipped, which will affect the sound of your calls. If they have, replace them. Before you remove the reeds, use a felt-tip pen to mark how far down the reeds are screwed into the call so you can replace them at the same depth. Misaligning the reeds will result in a changed tone and make it difficult to reproduce your calls. Summary:","completion":"Choose the appropriate duck call based on the size of the body of water and wind conditions. A double-reeded wooden call is suitable for small, calm areas, while an acrylic call is better for large bodies of water or windy conditions. Accuracy is crucial, so watch the reactions of the ducks to your calls and adjust accordingly. Use calls sparingly and effectively, observing the ducks' behavior and adjusting your calling frequency. Practice by listening to commercial CDs and real ducks in the wild, ensuring you can effectively imitate their sounds. Proper maintenance of your duck call is essential, including drying and wiping down wooden calls, checking the reeds for damage, and marking the reed depth before removing for accurate reassembly. Be persistent, patient, and attentive while hunting to increase your chances of success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out.

The meeting involved both the United States (represented by Colin Powell as Secretary of State) and Japan (represented by Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura). The purpose of the meeting was to engage in dialogue and discuss pressing international issues, providing an opportunity for the two nations to share their perspectives and potentially coordinate their efforts. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the items discussed at the event: 1. Iraq: At the time of this meeting, the situation in Iraq was of significant global concern. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces, the country was facing issues related to the rebuilding of its infrastructure, political stability, and security. Discussions between the United States and Japan may have revolved around Japan's help in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts, and its role in supporting the new Iraqi government. 2. Afghanistan: Similarly, the situation in Afghanistan was a critical international issue, with the country still in turmoil after being invaded by U.S. and NATO forces in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Reconstruction efforts and cooperation in combatting terrorism were likely topics of discussion between Powell and Machimura. 3. North Korea: Concerns about North Korea's nuclear program, which led to heightened tensions and multiple international crises, remained a significant topic of discussion for both the United States and Japan. North Korea was often seen as a destabilizing force in East Asia. The discussion may have included ways to work together to address North Korea's nuclear proliferation and ensure a peaceful resolution to the crisis. 4. China: As a neighboring country and growing superpower in the region, China was undeniably a topic of conversation between the representatives. The increased influence of China in the international sphere and its role in East Asia would have been discussed, as well as potential areas of cooperation or concern between the United States, Japan, and China. 5. UN Reform: Ideas around reforming the United Nations were circulating at this time, aimed at making the organization more efficient and effective in responding to global issues. The United States and Japan, as major players on the world stage, may have delved into discussing potential reforms and possible avenues to accomplish them. 6. Japan's Insistence: Based on the passage, it appears that Japan had specific concerns or demands that it wanted to emphasize during the meeting. While the details of these concerns are not provided in the passage, they likely referred to areas where Japan sought greater recognition or involvement, as well as security concerns that were important to the Japanese government and people. In conclusion, the passage is about a meeting between Secretary of State Colin Powell and Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura, during which they discussed key issues faced by the international community at that time. The main ideas were related to Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, China, UN reform, and Japan's specific concerns. These discussions served as an important channel for maintaining communication and cooperation between the United States and Japan, both of whom are influential players on the international stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Short movie review: cold , gray Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the given short movie review, it seems that the critic was thinking negatively about the movie. The terms \\"cold\\" and \\"gray\\" are usually associated with a bleak, uninviting, and somber atmosphere, which suggests that the critic did not find the movie to be enjoyable or engaging. These adjectives convey a sense of distance and detachment, implying that the movie might have failed to create a strong emotional connection with the audience or evoke a positive response. If we dive deeper into the possible meanings behind this review, the descriptor \\"cold\\" could imply several things, which might affect the critic's overall perception of the movie. For example, \\"cold\\" might indicate that the film's characters were unrelatable or underdeveloped, that the plot felt emotionally distant, or that the pacing and tone of the movie were too slow or monotonous. Moreover, it could also suggest that the film's aesthetics were uninviting or that its visual style did not resonate with the critic. Similarly, \\"gray\\" is an adjective that might denote feelings of ambiguity, monotony, or dreariness. Taking into account that this was a movie review, \\"gray\\" could indicate that the film's color palette was dull and uninspiring, or that the themes and narrative elements presented in the movie were not engaging to the critic. Additionally, \\"gray\\" might also imply a certain lack of distinction between characters, plotlines, or emotions, which could render the movie feeling somewhat muddled and nondescript. In conclusion, considering the negative connotations associated with the adjectives \\"cold\\" and \\"gray,\\" it is apparent that the critic had an unfavorable opinion of the movie. The terms reflect a perception of the film as unengaging, emotionally distant, and visually uninspired, which would not contribute to a positive movie-watching experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, sentiment analysis is not always straightforward, as the interpretation may be influenced by linguistic nuances, sarcasm, or cultural factors. In some contexts, a word like \\"dreck\\" might be used humorously or with exaggeration, potentially lessening the negativity of the sentiment. It is essential to consider the broader context in which the sentence is used to better identify the intended sentiment.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Redd Foxx was born John Elroy Sanford on December 9, 1922, in St. Louis, Missouri and raised on Chicago's South Side. His father, Fred Sanford, an electrician and auto mechanic from Hickman, Kentucky, left his family when Foxx was four years old. He was raised by his half-Seminole Indian mother, Mary Hughes from Ellisville, Mississippi, his grandmother and his minister. Foxx attended DuSable High School in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood with future Chicago mayor Harold Washington. Foxx achieved his most widespread fame starring in the television sitcom Sanford and Son, an adaptation of the BBC series Steptoe and Son. He used his starring role on Sanford and Son to help get jobs for his acquaintances such as LaWanda Page, Slappy White, Gregory Sierra, Don Bexley, Beah Richards, Stymie Beard, Leroy Daniels, Ernest Mayhand and Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita. The series premiered on the NBC television network on January 14, 1972 and was broadcast for six seasons. The final episode aired on March 25, 1977. Foxx played the role of Fred G. Sanford (\\"Fred Sanford\\" was actually Foxx's father's and brother's name), while Foxx's co-star Demond Wilson played the role of his son Lamont. In this sitcom, Fred and Lamont were owners of a junk/salvage store in Watts who dealt with many humorous situations that would arise. The series was notable for its racial humor and overt prejudices which helped redefine the genre of black situation comedy. The show also had several running gags. When angry with Lamont, Fred would often say \\"You big dummy\\" or would often fake heart attacks by putting his hand on his chest and saying (usually while looking up at the sky) \\"It's the big one, I'm coming to join ya honey/Elizabeth\\" (referring to his late wife). Fred would also complain about having \\"arthur-itis\\" to get out of working by showing Lamont his cramped hand. Foxx depicted a character in his 60s, although in real-life he was a decade younger. Demond Wilson had responded if he kept in touch with everybody from Sanford & Son; esp. the series' star, himself, after the series was canceled: \\"No. I saw Redd Foxx once before he died, circa 1983, and I never saw him again. At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn't spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd's office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I'm protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson's memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby I'm Back. My hurt was that he didn't come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that.\\" was elizabeth his wife?","completion":"Yes, in the TV show Sanford and Son, Elizabeth was Fred's late wife.

Article: There are two major parties in Britain today,the Conservative and the Labour,which have been in power by turns since 1945.The twoparty system of Britain was formed in the course of the development of the capitalist state and the political parties. To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time. In 1833,the Tory Party split into two and its name was changed to Conservative. In the 1860s the Whigs became Liberals. Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich. The working class became more and more unwilling to follow the Conservatives and the Liberals. They wanted to have their own party. So the Labour Party was formed by the trade unions. After 1922,the Labour Party gradually replaced the Liberal Party. Question: According to the passage,why was the Labour Party established in Britain? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The Labour Party was established in Britain because the working class became more and more unwilling to follow the Conservatives and the Liberals, and they wanted to have their own party. It was formed by the trade unions to represent their interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Coming off an upset win over the Green Bay Packers, the Steelers hosted the Baltimore Ravens in their second matchup of the season. There was much at stake, as the Ravens needed to win to get into the playoffs, and the Steelers needed to win in order to keep their faint playoff hopes alive as well. Jeff Reed booted 26-yard and 39-yard field goals and Billy Cundiff kicked a 27-yarder to give the Steelers a 6-3 lead as they started the second quarter. The Steelers offense would start rolling, scoring on a 4-yard run by Rashard Mendenhall. Joe Flacco responded with a 30-yard TD pass to Todd Heap. But in the final seconds of the first half, Ben Roethlisberger found Santonio Holmes for a 24-yard TD pass, and the Steelers carried a 20-10 lead with them into halftime. Baltimore controlled the third quarter. Flacco hit Heaps for a seven-yard TD pass and Cundiff kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the game. The fourth quarter saw both defenses step up. Jeff Reed kicked a 38-yard field goal with 5:25 remaining to give the Steelers a 23-20 lead. Baltimore had one more chance to score, but rookie defensive end Ziggy Hood recorded his first career sack and then recovered Flacco's fumble on a fourth and 10 play from the Steelers' 39 with 2:27 remaining. An apparent interception thrown by Roethlisberger was negated by an \\"illegal block in the back\\" penalty and the Steelers ran out the clock, securing the win.

Although they vary depending on who has written them, most essay prompts include similar information. Essay prompts can seem overwhelming at first, especially if they incorporate a lot of information, but knowing what you're looking for can help you decipher them.","completion":"The most logical next event after understanding how to read an essay prompt is the process of brainstorming and outlining the essay. This step is crucial as it helps in organizing thoughts, finding supporting evidence, and refining the arguments while ensuring that the essay's content aligns with the prompt's requirements. 1. Analyze the prompt: Once you have read and deciphered the essay prompt, it is essential to analyze its various components, including the assigned topic, any specific questions or issues to address, and the expected format, such as argumentative or narrative. Focus on the keywords and phrases in the prompt to understand the scope and expectations of the essay. 2. Brainstorm ideas: Take time to brainstorm and generate ideas relevant to the topic or question, allowing your thoughts to flow freely without limitations. Jot down every idea that comes to mind, regardless of how off-topic or random it may seem. This process will give you a diverse range of ideas to select from later. 3. Organize thoughts: Begin organizing the ideas you brainstormed by grouping them into categories or themes. This categorization can help to identify patterns and connections between your thoughts and will enable you to focus on the most relevant and compelling points. Identify the main points you want your essay to discuss. 4. Formulate a thesis statement: The thesis statement is a one or two-sentence summary of your essay's central argument, claim, or point. It serves as the backbone of your essay. The thesis statement should be clear, concise, and focused, outlining the specific issue or problem you intend to address in your essay. 5. Create an outline: After developing a thesis statement, create an outline for your essay, which will serve as a roadmap and help you structure your thoughts coherently. An outline typically includes an introduction (with the thesis statement), body paragraphs (with topic sentences and supporting arguments or evidence), and a conclusion (summing up your main points and thesis). An outline helps ensure that your essay is logically organized and flows well from one point to the next. 6. Conduct research (if necessary): Depending on the type of essay and the prompt, you may need to conduct research to find supporting evidence or examples that validate your argument. Ensure that any research conducted uses reputable sources, such as scholarly articles, books, or credible websites. 7. Write the first draft: With a clear understanding of the essay prompt and a well-organized outline, start writing your essay's first draft. It is essential to remember that the first draft does not need to be perfect; it is an opportunity to flesh out your ideas and refine your arguments. Make sure your writing is clear, concise, and directly addresses the essay prompt. 8. Revise and edit: Once you have completed your first draft, revise and edit your essay to ensure it meets the prompt requirements and is free of any errors, including grammatical, punctuation, or spelling issues. This step may involve multiple revisions to ensure the essay is polished and refined. 9. Proofread: Before submitting your essay, proofread it one final time to catch any remaining errors or inconsistencies. It may be helpful to have a friend, family member, or teacher review your essay to provide additional insights and feedback. By following these steps, you'll be well-equipped to start and complete an essay that effectively addresses the essay prompt and presents a compelling argument or narrative.

Question: What happens the night after Romulus is crowned? Movie title: The Last Legion Movie plot: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.

Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist. Heeding the subliminal warning, she changed plans and stepped out into the crawling Duval Street traffic. A purple taxi honked angrily but she just smiled as she strode across the street and stared intently at a display of cheap, tasteless T-shirts in a storefront window. Question: How long did it probably take her to get across the street? Options: - not enough information - Just a few seconds. - More than 5 minutes. - She never made it across the street.

Q: Alex talks to the store owner because they would be good for business. Given the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", is \\"quit their job\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, \\"quit their job\\" does not seem to be a valid answer to the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\" The context suggests that Alex is engaging with the store owner because they believe it would be good for business. This implies that Alex is likely motivated and proactive in their current position. Instead, a more valid response to the question might involve Alex seeking to develop or maintain a strong relationship with the store owner to foster mutual business growth. Alex could consider the following steps: 1. Building rapport: Ensuring effective communication with the store owner would be paramount. Practicing interpersonal skills such as actively listening, empathizing, and expressing genuine interest in the store owner's needs and goals could lead to a strong working relationship. 2. Identifying collaboration opportunities: Alex should explore ways in which they can work together with the store owner to drive mutual growth. Whether it be through joint promotions, product placements, or co-hosted events, finding avenues for collaboration can strengthen their partnership and create new business opportunities. 3. Sharing insights and expertise: Alex can offer their knowledge and experience to the store owner to help them improve their operations or marketing strategies. They can share industry trends, best practices, or even their own personal experiences to benefit the store owner and their business. 4. Setting up regular check-ins: By scheduling regular meetings, Alex could keep in touch with the store owner, ensuring that ongoing support and assistance are provided. These check-ins can be a platform to discuss progress updates, challenges faced, and new opportunities for collaboration. 5. Monitoring and evaluating the partnership: To measure the success of the partnership, Alex should establish metrics and KPIs to monitor progress and evaluate its impact on both parties' businesses. By doing so, necessary adjustments can be made to continuously optimize the relationship. To summarize, quitting their job does not appear to be a valid answer to what Alex would want to do next. Instead, Alex should focus on building and nurturing the relationship with the store owner to ensure mutual business benefits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Queens and The Bronx are concurrent with the counties of the same name, while Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island correspond to New York, Kings, and Richmond Counties respectively. Is it true that is brooklyn a borough of new york city?","completion":"Yes, it is true that Brooklyn is a borough of New York City. Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs that make up the city, and it is located in the southeastern part of the city. Each borough is coextensive with a respective county, the primary administrative subdivision within New York State. In the case of Brooklyn, it is coextensive with Kings County, which is the most populous county in the state and the second-most densely populated county in the United States. Brooklyn, originally settled by the Dutch in the 17th century under the name Breuckelen, has a rich and diverse history. It has a unique identity and culture and is known for its distinct neighborhoods, cultural institutions, and attractions. The borough is home to iconic sites such as Coney Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and Prospect Park. It also boasts a thriving arts scene, with numerous galleries, music venues, and theaters. Over the years, Brooklyn has seen significant population growth and development, attracting people from all over the world with its vibrant communities, job opportunities, and affordable housing options compared to Manhattan. With roughly 2.6 million residents, if Brooklyn were an independent city, it would be the fourth most populous city in the United States. Brooklyn has served as a melting pot for various ethnic and cultural groups, resulting in a diverse population that has contributed to its reputation as a cultural center. This diversity is reflected in the array of cuisines, languages spoken, and local events and festivals held throughout the year. In addition to its vibrant neighborhoods and lively cultural scene, Brooklyn is increasingly becoming an essential economic hub. The borough has experienced a surge in innovation and entrepreneurship, with the rise of startup companies, incubators, and coworking spaces. Brooklyn Navy Yard, for example, is a significant industrial complex that has transformed into a hub for manufacturing, technology, and design companies. In conclusion, Brooklyn is indeed one of the five boroughs of New York City and plays a critical role in shaping the city's identity, culture, and economy. As coextensive with Kings County, it is a vital administrative division within the state of New York, and its unique character, diverse population, and thriving business landscape contribute to the city's overall appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase? Answer the above question based on the context below: Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

You really would expect more out of this highly stylish and modern cafe located in the newest hotel in Vegas, Aria at citycenter. Cafe Vettro features high ceilings with floor to ceiling glass windows. Windows were complimented with exposed steel beams, and plenty of glass and stone decor throughout. This gorgeous cafe however, is brought down by the food which i can't speak as highly about. I came here for breakfast and ordered their 16 omelette. For double the price of an omelette (with one less ingredient choice) than that of the Grand Lux Cafe at the Venetian, I expected it to be twice as good. Unfortunately this was not the case. The omelette was lackluster to say the least.. The cheese was a single slice layed out on top which left the inside of the omelette feeling very dry and tasting rather bland. Coffee was an extra 4.50. Double the price of what you'd pay for a Venti coffee at Starbuck's. I don't mind this, but what turned me off about this was that our waitress brought me a cup, and left the thermal pot at our table. While this had a certain level of convenience, it lacked the personal touch and required attentiveness most cafes and diners offer when our waitress returns to inquire if we'd like a refill. So overall while the ambiance was easy on the eyes, my wallet had a hard time justifying the 25 price tag for a boring omelette, and a less than personal experience.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who is killed in a car crash with Cavanaugh?, using the article: News anchor Barry Baron discovers that a drug smuggling ring is operating out of the building where he works, and is chased down and eventually shot dead by the drug dealers. His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash.

However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.

Write the answer: In which town was Colonel Gaddafi killed in 2011?","completion":"Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the long-time ruler of Libya, was killed on October 20, 2011, during the Battle of Sirte. Sirte is a coastal city in Libya, situated approximately 450 kilometers (280 miles) to the east of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. Historically, Sirte has been a significant location in Libya due to its strategic position along the Mediterranean Sea. In 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, the city of Sirte became a crucial battleground between Gaddafi's loyalist forces and the National Transitional Council (NTC) backed by NATO intervention. The NTC was a coalition of anti-Gaddafi factions, which sought to overthrow Gaddafi's regime and establish a democratic government. As NATO airforces targeted Libyan military installations, NTC forces moved toward Sirte in an attempt to cut off Gaddafi's escape routes from Tripoli. Sirte, being Gaddafi's hometown, had immense symbolic significance, and was a stronghold for his remaining loyalist forces. The Battle of Sirte began in mid-September 2011, with NTC forces attacking the city from multiple directions and besieging it. Intense fighting between the two sides led to devastating destruction in the city, with civilians caught in the crossfire. After several weeks, the loyalist resistance gradually weakened, allowing NTC forces to advance further into the city. On October 20, 2011, as the NTC fighters closed in on Sirte, Gaddafi attempted to flee the city in a convoy of vehicles, but was intercepted by NATO airstrikes and ground forces. Reports suggest that Gaddafi was initially captured alive, but soon after sustained fatal injuries, either from crossfire or at the hands of NTC fighters. His death marked the end of his 42-year rule. The killing of Colonel Gaddafi in Sirte led to an end of the Libyan Civil War and the establishment of a transitional government by the NTC. However, the following years have witnessed significant political and social instability in Libya, with multiple factions vying for control of the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: After decades of debate, Brunei decided to adopt electrical vehicles and use them extensively, ultimately phasing out gasoline powered vehicles. Their neighbor Nepal decided to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively. Which country experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere? A:","completion":"A: Brunei experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. After extensive debate, Brunei decided to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. This change would have a significant impact on the levels of volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere in the country. Electric vehicles have several advantages over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, which contribute to reduced emissions and improved air quality. First, electric vehicles do not emit tailpipe pollutants, such as volatile hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These pollutants come from the exhaust of gasoline-powered vehicles and contribute to poor air quality, which can have negative consequences, including respiratory ailments and other health problems. By choosing to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles and embrace electric vehicles, Brunei is effectively eliminating a significant source of volatile hydrocarbon emissions. Second, electric vehicles have higher energy efficiency compared to gasoline-powered vehicles. As a result, the overall environmental impact of electricity generation for electric vehicles is lower compared to the extraction, refining, transport, and combustion of gasoline. Although some greenhouse gas emissions are associated with electricity production for electric vehicles, the overall emissions are still lower than those produced by gasoline-powered vehicles, further reducing the levels of volatile hydrocarbons and other pollutants in Brunei's atmosphere. In contrast, Nepal's decision to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively would mean that volatile hydrocarbon emissions would remain prevalent in their atmosphere. In addition to the direct emissions produced by gasoline vehicles, there would be an ongoing demand for the extraction and refining of fossil fuels, which also release emissions, including volatile hydrocarbons. In summary, the country that experienced fewer volatile hydrocarbons in the atmosphere is Brunei, primarily due to their decision to adopt electric vehicles and phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. This choice significantly reduces tailpipe emissions and decreases the overall environmental impact from the extraction, refining, and consumption of gasoline. On the other hand, Nepal's decision to continue using gasoline-powered vehicles extensively would maintain, or potentially increase, the levels of volatile hydrocarbons in their atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen invents \\"downsizing\\", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches (12.7 cm); he and his wife Anne-Helene become part of the first human test subjects once the process is proven safe and demonstrate it to the world. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money. Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, New Mexico, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through with the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him. One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrank further still due to divorce settlement negotiations. Paul, whose occupational therapist license had lapsed and faced a re-certification process due to Leisureland being in another state, now works as a customer service representative for Lands' End.

How do I create a GUI using c in visual studio?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning. They each address a different programming language and task. Let's analyze both questions: 1. How do I use a Python module with Visual Studio? This question relates to the Python programming language and asks for guidance on using a Python module within the context of the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). Here is a detailed answer for this question: To use a Python module with Visual Studio, follow these steps: 1. Install the Python workload in Visual Studio: If you haven't already, make sure that you have the Python workload installed in Visual Studio. This can be done during the installation process or added later on by modifying the installation via the Visual Studio Installer. 2. Create or open a Python project: Create a new Python project in Visual Studio or open an existing one. 3. Install the desired Python module: You can install the module either through pip (a package installer for Python) or by adding it directly to your project. To install a module using pip, open the Python Environments window in Visual Studio by right-clicking the Python Environment node in the Solution Explorer and selecting \\"View All Python Environments.\\" Then, click on the desired environment, select the \\"Packages\\" tab, and search for the module you want to install. Once you find it, click \\"Install Package.\\" 4. Import the module in your Python script: In your Python script, you can now import the installed module by adding an import statement to the top of your file. For example, if you installed the \\"requests\\" module, you would import it like this: \`\`\`python import requests \`\`\` 5. Use the module functionality: Once the module has been imported, you can use its functionality in your Python script according to the module's documentation. For example, if you were using the \\"requests\\" module, you could make an HTTP request like this: \`\`\`python response = requests.get(\\"https://www.example.com\\") print(response.text) \`\`\` 2. How do I create a GUI using C in Visual Studio? This question focuses on the C programming language and asks for guidance on creating a graphical user interface (GUI) within the context of the Visual Studio IDE. Here is a detailed answer for this question: To create a GUI using C in Visual Studio, you can use a framework such as the Windows API or GTK+. In this example, we'll discuss using the Windows API: 1. Install the Desktop development with C++ workload in Visual Studio: Ensure that you have the Desktop development with C++ workload installed in Visual Studio. This can be done during the installation process or added later on by modifying the installation via the Visual Studio Installer. 2. Create a new C project: Create a new \\"Win32 Project\\" in Visual Studio. On the \\"Application Settings\\" page of the \\"Win32 Application Wizard\\", select \\"Windows application\\" and check the \\"Empty project\\" option. 3. Add a C source file: In your project, add a new C source file (e.g., \\"main.c\\"), in which you'll write the GUI code. 4. Include the necessary Windows API headers: At the beginning of your C source file, include the required Windows API headers, such as: \`\`\`c #include <Windows.h> \`\`\` 5. Write the GUI code: Create the main function and define the window class, window message loop, and window procedure. For example: \`\`\`c LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProcedure(HWND, UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM); int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow) { // Define the Window Class WNDCLASS wc = {0}; wc.lpszClassName = TEXT(\\"MyWindowClass\\"); wc.lpfnWndProc = WindowProcedure; wc.hInstance = hInstance; // Register the Window Class if (!RegisterClass(&wc)) { MessageBox(NULL, TEXT(\\"Failed to register window class.\\"), TEXT(\\"Error\\"), MB_ICONERROR); return 1; } // Create the Window HWND hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT(\\"MyWindowClass\\"), TEXT(\\"My Window\\"), WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW | WS_VISIBLE, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, 400, 300, NULL, NULL, hInstance, NULL); // Run the Message Loop MSG msg = {0}; while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) { TranslateMessage(&msg); DispatchMessage(&msg); } return 0; } LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProcedure(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { switch (uMsg) { case WM_DESTROY: PostQuitMessage(0); break; default: return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam); } return 0; } \`\`\` 6. Compile and run your application: Compile and run your application to see the created GUI window. You can further customize and develop your GUI using the extensive functionalities provided by the Windows API. In conclusion, the two questions focus on different tasks in two different programming languages, involving distinct processes to achieve the desired outcomes."},{"prompt":"This article: Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works.

Now Opening | An Imeldific Show Carol Rosegg Jaygee Macapugay will belt out “Martial Law … With a Smile” at tonight’s opening of “Imelda, A New Musical.” Everything about Imelda Marcos flies on rumor. From her “affair” with the assiduously tanned actor George Hamilton to the construction workers supposedly encased in concrete at the Manila Film Center on her orders, the Steel Butterfly has battled her fair share of gossip. Tonight, “Imelda, A New Musical” opens at the Julia Miles Theatre, complete with its own Marcos mini-drama. As the Pan Asian Repertory Theater’s singing and dancing story of the beloved, beloathed and BeDazzled fallen Philippine first lady’s life makes its East Coast debut, word is that the Muse of Manila (an honorific bestowed on Imelda after she successfully protested her third-place finish at the Miss Manila contest) is most concerned about what the lead looks like. Apparently the 5-foot-2 star of the Los Angeles production was deemed too short by the proud 5-foot-7 beauty queen, who sent one of her Blue Ladies to scope out the musical. (“She was wonderful, very put-together, very elegant and very over-the-top,” says costume designer Ivy Chou of the mole. “You could spot her a mile away.”) Well, that’s the dish anyway. Perhaps the chatter made its mark again. The New York premiere has taken it up a notch with the 5-foot-6 “Miss Saigon” and “Aida” vet Jaygee Macapugay as Imelda. And Chou has made sure she is properly swathed in Imeldific (a self-coined adjective that Meldy used to mean “ostentatious extravagance”) wear: “There was a general consensus that she should be over-the-top and glitzy regardless of what camp you’re from.” The production, which uses 17 high-energy songs to span the 1940s to the 1980s, features pastel and sepia-toned looks that reflect the faded streets of Manila and gain intensity as the show progresses. Pearls give way to rhinestones, crystals and a giant chandelier necklace; a simple ’40s frock is tossed aside for a royal purple butterfly-sleeve terno dress embellished with rows of beaded fringe; gold leather pants and a tube top; and a “Hollywood” Filipino gown donated to the show by the wife of the former Canadian consul general. Of course, there are shoes. And a song about them, “3,000 Pairs of Shoes” — though Imelda insists there were only 1,060. (“Why the thrills for my espadrilles? What boring chat. I will tell my story, all without this Imelda Marcos shoe mystique. Love and youth, tragedy and truth, laughs, romance and all that. Talk of shoes, what a pain. I’m here to entertain!”) Some 80 pairs grace the stage, with Imelda slipping into vintage and dance footwear like blue beaded mules, snakeskin T-straps and silver glitter Very Fine Dancesport Shoes. But all the flair won’t be on stage. Butterfly sleeves and barongs are bound to make an appearance in the crowd. The Philippine consul general, Cecilia Rebong, and Lea Salonga are expected to attend the show. Alas, the diva herself will not be there. Imelda, now 80, politely declined an invitation to the musical. But we could always say she threw a fit and refused to come. “Imelda, A New Musical” is playing at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, through Oct. 18. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"\\"Imelda, A New Musical\\" is a show about the life of Imelda Marcos, the former Philippine first lady, and it includes songs and outfits that represent her life from the 1940s to the 1980s.

Information: - Axion estin ( Greek : , Slavonic : ó é , Dostóino yes ) , or It is Truly Meet , is a megalynarion and a theotokion , i.e. a magnification of and a Hymn to Mary which is chanted in the Divine Services of the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches . It is a troparion and a sticheron composed in honor of the Theotokos ( i.e. the Virgin Mary ) . The same name also refers to a style of icon of the Theotokos . - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes. - The Eastern Orthodox Church, also known as the Orthodox Church, or officially as the Orthodox Catholic Church, is the second largest Christian church and one of the oldest current religious institutions in the world. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that it is the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church established by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission to the apostles. It practices what it understands to be the original Christian faith and maintains the sacred tradition passed down from the apostles. - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots. - The Megalynarion (Greek , \\"magnification\\", \\"that which magnifies\\"; also called \\"Velichaniye\\" in Church Slavonic) is a special hymn used in the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches that follow the Byzantine Rite. Depending on the local liturgical tradition, this hymn can be one of several. - A troparion (Greek , plural: troparia, ; Church Slavonic: , \\"tropar\\") in Byzantine music and in the religious music of Eastern Orthodox Christianity is a short hymn of one stanza, or organised in more complex forms as series of stanzas. - Byzantine music, in a narrow sense, is the music of the Byzantine Empire. Originally it consisted of songs and hymns composed to Greek texts used for courtly ceremonials, during festivals, or as paraliturgical and liturgical music. The ecclesiastical forms of Byzantine music are the best known forms today, because different Orthodox traditions still identify with the heritage of Byzantine music, when their cantors sing monodic chant out of the traditional chant books like sticherarion which in fact consisted of five books, and the heirmologion. Byzantine music did not disappear after the fall of Constantinople. Its traditions continued under the Patriarchate of Constantinople which was annexed by the Islamic Ottoman ruler Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, and granted administrative responsibilities over all Orthodox Christians. During the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, burgeoning splinter nations in the Balkans declared autonomy or \\"autocephaly\\" against the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The new self-declared patriarchates were independent nations defined by their religion. In this context, Christian religious chant practiced in the Ottoman empire, Bulgaria and Greece among other nations, was based on the historical roots of the art tracing back to the Byzantine Empire, while the music of the Patriarchate created during the Ottoman period was often regarded as \\"post-Byzantine.\\" This explains why Byzantine music refers to several Orthodox Christian chant traditions of the Mediterranean and of the Caucasus practiced in recent history and even today, and this article cannot be limited to the music culture of the Byzantine past.

Let's solve this math problem together, step by step. The problem is: -464 = -6 * w - 386 First, we need to get rid of the '-386' on this side to find out what 'w' is. We do this by adding 386 to both sides of the equation: -464 + 386 = -6 * w - 386 + 386 Now, if you add -464 and 386 together, you get: -78 = -6 * w Now we want to find out what 'w' is by removing the '-6'. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. Like this: -78 / -6 = (-6 * w) / -6 Now, if you divide -78 by -6, you get: 13 = w So our answer is w = 13!

When I talk about 'the film' I am talking about parts 1 & 2 together when watched one after the other, as they should be. Thank you Jon Anderson, Steven Soderbergh & Benicio Del Toro. This film is a refreshing, bold, gritty and true film. And, it hearkens a new style of film making. No Faux drama. No Swelling sound track. Not Faux Documentary style. Just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts. I have been reading Jon Anderson's \\"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\\" and recently finished Fidel's Auto biography, and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly. But I have to say that it is Jon Anderson's exhaustive, penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone. Anderson was consultant on this film (or these 2 films). What makes this film a true thing is that it is clean. No swelling music or slow-motion photography to heighten drama, and even more importantly; no fake documentary shaky camera. Just square shots and straight forward shooting style. The type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle. Benicio Del Toro should be given full honors for this, I never doubted him as Che throughout the film... not once. He did a wonderful job and I will respect him for ever for this. Some people complain that the film only deals with 2 slices of his life and not the whole. But I think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film: it doesn't try to be everything. It doesn't try to 'tell the story'. A person's life is too multifaceted to try and tell in 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 hours. This is one of the subtle beauties of this film, it resists that temptation, and stays focused on the intent of letting us GET A FEEL FOR CHE, HIS DEVELOPING MILITARISTIC MIND AND THE FORCES AROUND HIM. It focuses on 3 slices of time: The Battle to over throw Batista, Che's U.N. speech and the Gorilla preparations in Bolivia. \\"Motorcycle Diaries\\" already told his young man side, and I applaud S. Soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead. I keep referring to Jon Anderson's book and the film stays true. The only weak link for me are the casting (not the performance) of Matt Damon. In a film so loaded with true to life performances, an American, (Matt Damon) playing a Bolivian is a clunky stretch - he does well, but after so much care in the casting, this was an over-site. Small and completely forgiven. The reality that the rest of the casting gives you, and most notably Benicio Del Toro's amazing job, put's this film at the top of my list. The fact that this film went almost straight to video say's something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the 'revolutionized Cuba' to become what it might have, are still at work keeping it's story quiet. If not out of clandestine muffling, then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic. This is a must see film, and Jon Anderson's \\"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\\" is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international / political financial chess moves of the 40's, 50's & 60's that placed unfair pressure on our South American neighbors, and the effects it fostered.","completion":"b. positive"},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Embittered, she taught Mickey to be street smart so he will never be taken advantage of like her. Fuzzy strongly disapproves of how she is raising her son.

When Letty's lawyer, Adolphe, learns that Mal is the wealthy president of Amalgamated Dairies (out checking every aspect of his large business), he talks Letty into seizing the opportunity to make some money. They get Mickey to lie about the extent of his injuries. However, during the trial, Mal's attorney (Paul Harvey) produces films showing Mickey fully recovered. The irate judge has Mickey taken from Letty and put in an institution for boys. Mal and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns) have no children. Mal offers to adopt Mickey, with Letty's approval, so she can see her son more frequently. Mickey thrives on Mal's country estate and the loving parenting he receives.

He loved his shoes more than she loved her sandals, because the","completion":"shoes were not only a testament to his impeccable sense of style, but also a symbol of his journey through life. Each pair of shoes he owned seemed to hold memories and emotions, almost as if they were living beings. The scuff-marks, creases, and even the distinct smell of the well-worn leather all told a story. Perhaps that’s why he found it difficult to discard them even when they were beyond repair. In comparison, her love for sandals seemed to be based on a certain practicality and ease of use, rather than emotions and memories. Sure, she adored the way they displayed her manicured toes and slender ankles, and how they perfectly complemented her breezy sundresses and swimsuits during the hot summer months. But, when the cold weather approached, and her feet desperately sought the warm confines of socks and boots, those sandals were long forgotten, tucked away in the depths of the shoe rack. Although both of them cherished their respective footwear, the depth of sentiment that existed between him and his shoes was something she couldn't quite comprehend. To her, the mere act of slipping her feet into the sandals was a fleeting moment of bliss, one that could easily be replaced by the feel of another pair. It was a transient affection, a summer fling easily discarded as soon as the season changed. But for him, each pair held a particular significance, whether it was the wingtips he wore to his sister’s wedding, the sneakers he couldn’t bring himself to throw away after running his first marathon, or the fashionably distressed leather loafers he splurged on during a moment of artistic inspiration. So many key moments in his life had been punctuated by the act of choosing and wearing those shoes, and in a way, they had become an integral part of his identity. The difference in the way they each viewed their footwear preferences often led to playful debates between the two. She would tease him about his sentimental attachment to his shoes, joking that he should be more like her and free himself from such emotional baggage. He would counter by pointing out her fickleness, wondering aloud how she could change her tastes with the seasons, leaving behind one pair for another without a second thought. They may not have fully understood each other’s perspective, but in the end, these differences were what made their relationship special. This harmony in their contrast brought balance to their love. It was an unspoken acceptance of their contrasting quirks, creating an intricate dance that wove the fabric of their life together ever so tightly. In the grander scheme of things, it wasn't about the shoes or the sandals, but about the love they had for each other and how they found solace and comfort in their bond, a bond that not even the most delicate of sandals or the most expensive pair of shoes could compare to. Together, they walked through life hand in hand, their feet clad in the footwear that spoke of their individuality but also bound them together in the beautiful steps they danced to the rhythm of their love."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - The liver removes toxins from the blood - Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.

These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Vitis vinifera (common grape vine) is a species of \\"Vitis\\", native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern Germany and east to northern Iran. There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of \\"Vitis vinifera\\" grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production. - Rockpile AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Sonoma County , California , northwest of the town of Healdsburg . Established on February 28 , 2002 , Rockpile AVA was Sonoma County 's twelfth designated wine appellation . The wine region consists of approximately 15,400 acres ( 62 km2 ) in northwestern Sonoma County . All of the AVA has an elevation in excess of 800 feet ( 244 m ) above sea level . Eleven vineyards are currently located within the AVA and there are approximately 160 acres ( 1 km2 ) of planted wine grapes . - Vitis labrusca (fox grape) is a species of grapevines belonging to the \\"Vitis\\" genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and are the source of many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape \\"Vitis vinifera\\" are its \\"slip-skin\\" that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European \\"vinifera\\" is the characteristic \\"foxy\\" musk of \\"V. labrusca\\", best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term \\"foxy\\" became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"If the statement \\"my pancreas doesn't work\\" occurs, it means that there is a malfunction in the pancreas, which will have a direct impact on specific steps of the process, and indirectly affect other components of the process as well. The pancreas plays a crucial role in the digestive process, specifically in the production and release of digestive enzymes and hormones. One of the key functions of the pancreas is producing insulin, a hormone that helps regulate glucose (sugar) levels in the blood. If your pancreas doesn't work, insulin production will be impaired, affecting the body's ability to process glucose properly. In this situation, the following perturbations will occur: 1. Directly impacting a step of the process: - Impaired production of digestive enzymes, including trypsin and chymotrypsin, which are essential for proper protein digestion. This will lead to difficulty in breaking down and absorbing nutrients from consumed proteins. - Insulin production will be affected, leading to an inability to effectively move glucose from the blood into cells, causing high blood sugar levels, commonly known as hyperglycemia. This condition can have various health implications if left untreated. 2. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: - Without the appropriate insulin levels, the enzymes in the pancreas may not be produced at the right time or in the correct amount. This may lead to further disruptions in the digestive process. - High blood sugar levels can also cause other health issues, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and increased risk for diabetes-related complications. In summary, if \\"my pancreas doesn't work,\\" it will directly impact steps of the process related to enzyme and insulin production, leading to disruptions in the digestion and glucose regulation.

We evaluated the mechanisms of thrombocytopenia and procoagulant changes in relation with clinical variables in a cohort of patients with acute hantavirus disease. Blood samples of 33 prospectively recruited, consecutive, hospitalized patients with acute Puumala virus-induced hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) were collected acutely and at the recovery visit (control). Serum thrombopoietin (TPO) and activity of plasma microparticles (MPs) from various cell sources were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods. The results were related to data on platelet indices and functions, coagulation variables, and clinical disease. Serum TPO was nearly 4-fold higher acutely compared with the control (median 207 pg/mL, range 56-1258 pg/mL vs. median 58 pg/mL, range 11-241 pg/mL, P < 0.001) and coincided with high mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction (IPF%). Prothrombin fragments and D-dimer were high acutely compared with the control (F1 + 2 median 704 pmol/L, range 284-1875 pmol/ L vs. median 249 pmol/L, range 118-556 pmol/L, P < 0.001; D-dimer median 2.8 mg/L, range 0.6-34.0 mg/L vs. median 0.4 mg/L, range 0.2-1.1 mg/L, P < 0.001), and associated with low platelet count and severe acute kidney injury (AKI). MPs' procoagulant activity was high acutely only among patients with mild AKI (plasma creatinine below the median at the time of the measurement). Upregulated TPO together with high MPV and IPF% confirm active thrombopoiesis, but do not predict severity of HFRS. Simultaneously, elevated prothrombin fragments and D-dimer suggest increased consumption of platelets in patients with severe AKI. Activity of platelet-derived MPs in HFRS should be studied with flow cytometry in a larger cohort of patients.

It's essential to stay connected and accessible to citizens, sharing updates and responding to their concerns. 6. Get-out-the-vote efforts: Before the election, Jordan and their campaign team should focus on motivating citizens to actually cast their votes. This can involve organizing rides to polling stations, sending reminders, or even hosting voting information sessions to educate citizens on the voting process. By executing these steps, Jordan can increase their chances of winning a seat on the city council and serving the community that they have encouraged to vote."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 0 = 44*w - 43*w + 10 for w.","completion":"To solve the given mathematical equation 0 = 44*w - 43*w + 10 for w, we must follow the proper algebraic steps to isolate the variable w. Here is a step-by-step solution: Step 1: First, we simplify the expression on the right-hand side of the equation by combining the like terms (the terms containing the variable w in this case). 0 = (44w - 43w) + 10 Step 2: Subtract 43w from 44w: 0 = 1w + 10 Now, we have a simplified expression: 0 = w + 10 Step 3: To isolate the variable w, we must eliminate the constant term (10) from the right side of the equation. As the constant is being added to the variable, we perform the inverse operation, which is subtraction, on both sides of the equation. 0 - 10 = w + 10 - 10 Step 4: Simplify both sides of the equation: -10 = w So, the solution to the given mathematical equation 0 = 44w - 43w + 10 is w = -10."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Philipp Grubauer to start, Martin Erat a healthy scratch against Lightning Philipp Grubauer will make his 10th start in 14 games Thursday in Tampa. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) TAMPA – Coach Adam Oates will go back to rookie netminder Philipp Grubauer as the Capitals kick off this critical stretch of the schedule Thursday against the Lightning. It will be Grubauer’s 10th start in the past 14 games as his strong play continues to complicate Washington’s depth chart in net. But with the Capitals having fallen out of a playoff position, they need wins. “He’s come up and from the first game he’s played great. Given us a little bit of spark. He’s earned an opportunity to play games and I’m playing him,” Oates said. “A little bit of a dilemma right now with three guys. My attitude is it’s a long year and everyone’s going to get plenty of opportunities to play and when a guy’s playing pretty good I’ve got to play him.” Grubauer stopped 32 of the 34 shots he faced in a relief outing against the Lightning back on Dec. 10 as the Capitals rallied for a 6-5 shootout win. Oates said the decision on which goaltender will start at home Friday against Toronto will depend, at least in part, on how Thursday’s contest plays out. >> Martin Erat will sit out as a healthy scratch after appearing in 16 straight games while Aaron Volpatti will be back in the lineup as fourth-line left wing. The last time Erat was made a healthy scratch, a three-game stretch from Nov. 23-29, the veteran winger went public with his demand that the Capitals trade him. Erat’s situation hasn’t changed since then; he still wants to be moved to another club but given his limited value – 15 assists and no goals in 39 games this season and requesting a trade for the second time in eight months – it’s unclear how strong of a market there is for the 32-year-old. Asked why he was scratching Erat, Oates was short. “Coach’s decision,” he said. >> Rookie defenseman Connor Carrick will make his first appearance with the Capitals since Oct. 5 after being summoned from AHL Hershey a day earlier. Carrick, 19, hasn’t played a game in North America at either level since Nov. 23 because of an upper-body injury but his strong performance for the United States in the 2014 World Junior Championships prompted the Capitals to bring him back into the mix. “Watching him in the juniors I thought he played very well,” said Oates, acknowledging that Carrick’s skating ability is an asset against the Lightning. “I know [General Manager] George [McPhee] got an email from the coach [Don Lucia] and talked to the coach. They thought especially the last few games that he played great and it was very high tempo. Like to see what he can do.” Steve Oleksy will sit out as a healthy scratch against Tampa Bay to make room for Carrick in the lineup. While he hasn’t seen consistent game action since late November, Carrick said the World Junior tournament helped him get back into the rhythm of competition after sitting out for several weeks with the injury. “I was a little banged up so I got to get three exhibition games, throw away games that didn’t really count for much. Good to get back into the flow of it,” Carrick said. “International hockey’s a lot different but it’s good experience and I think it helps my development. It’s a good experience to have.” >> Here are the projected lineups for both teams. Capitals Laich-Backstrom-Brouwer Fehr-Grabovski-Ovechkin Chimera-Johansson-Ward Volpatti-Beagle-Wilson Lightning Martin St. Louis-Tyler Johnson-Ondrej Palat Alex Killorn-Valtteri Filppula-Teddy Purcell Nikita Kucherov-Nate Thompson-B.J.

Is the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side.\\" true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side\\" can be considered true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door,\\" given that the description of the man's clothing matches in both cases. To break it down further, both descriptions refer to a man who is passing a door. Furthermore, they both state that the man is wearing white and black clothing. Now, let's analyze each part of the two descriptions: 1. The man passing the door: This statement matches the second description, which mentions that the man is passing the door. 2. Wearing a white shirt: The second description mentions that the man is wearing white and black. The first description specifies that the white garment is a shirt, which doesn't contradict the second description since it doesn't provide specific details about which garments are white or black. 3. Black running pants: The first description mentions black running pants, while the second description simply states that the man is wearing black. However, these statements don't contradict each other, as wearing black running pants still falls within the range of wearing black. 4. With white stripes down the side: The first description specifies that there are white stripes on the side of the black running pants. This detail is not mentioned in the second description, but it also doesn't present a contradiction. The man could still be wearing black and white clothes since the white stripes are just an additional detail. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the premise \\"The man passing the door is wearing a white shirt and black running pants with white stripes down the side\\" can be considered true if \\"The man wearing white and black is passing the door.\\" The specific details provided in the first description align with the more general description provided in the second statement, and there are no contradictions between them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The review contains several negative phrases and elements that indicate the critic's unfavorable opinion. Let us break down the review to further understand the critic's perspective: 1. \\"a remake by the numbers\\": This phrase implies that the movie is a formulaic and uninspired remake, lacking originality and creativity. The critic seems to suggest that the film relies on conventional or predictable elements to achieve its goals. 2. \\"linking a halfwit plot\\": By describing the plot as \\"halfwit,\\" the critic conveys that the storyline is simplistic, poorly thought out, and potentially lacking in depth or intelligence. This indicates dissatisfaction with the narrative aspect of the movie. 3. \\"a series of standup routines\\": The mention of \\"standup routines\\" denotes that the critic views the film as more of a compilation of comedic skits rather than a cohesive, well-executed movie with a solid throughline. This reference highlights the disjointed nature of the film, which the critic perceives as a negative aspect. 4. \\"wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie\\": Here, the critic acknowledges the potential of the lead actors (Wilson and Murphy) to be entertaining in a more ambitious film. However, by using the phrase \\"could have been,\\" the critic laments that their talent was not properly utilized in this particular movie. This sentiment reinforces the negative opinion of the film. In conclusion, the critic's review clearly reflects a negative viewpoint towards the movie, highlighting several issues such as the formulaic nature of the remake, a poorly-developed plot, a disjointed structure, and the underutilization of the actors' comedic abilities."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Q: Passage: Comprehensive schools have been accused of grade inflation after a study revealed that Gymnasium senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves at the very bottom of their class and had an average grade of \\"Five\\", which means \\"Failed\\". Gesamtschule senior students of average mathematical ability found themselves in the upper half of their class and had an average grade of \\"Three Plus\\". When a central Abitur examination was established in the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, it was revealed that Gesamtschule students did worse than could be predicted by their grades or class rank. Barbara Sommer (Christian Democratic Union), Education Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, commented that: Looking at the performance gap between comprehensives and the Gymnasium [at the Abitur central examination] [...] it is difficult to understand why the Social Democratic Party of Germany wants to do away with the Gymnasium. [...] The comprehensives do not help students achieve [...] I am sick and tired of the comprehensive schools blaming their problems on the social class origins of their students. What kind of attitude is this to blame their own students? She also called the Abitur awarded by the Gymnasium the true Abitur and the Abitur awarded by the Gesamtschule \\"Abitur light\\". As a reaction, Sigrid Beer (Alliance '90/The Greens) stated that comprehensives were structurally discriminated against by the government, which favoured the Gymnasiums. She also said that many of the students awarded the Abitur by the comprehensives came from \\"underprivileged groups\\" and sneering at their performance was a \\"piece of impudence\\".

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Movie plot: The picture begins with Moriarty and Holmes verbally sparring on the steps outside the Old Bailey where Moriarty has just been acquitted on a charge of murder due to lack of evidence. Holmes remarks, \\"You've a magnificent brain, Moriarty. I admire it. I admire it so much I'd like to present it, pickled in alcohol, to the London Medical Society\\". \\"It would make an impressive exhibit\\", replies Moriarty. Later Holmes and Watson are visited at 221B Baker Street by Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino). She tells him that her brother Lloyd has received a strange note - a drawing of a man with an albatross hanging around his neck - identical to one received by her father just before his brutal murder ten years before. Holmes deduces that the note is a warning and rushes to find Lloyd Brandon. However he is too late, as Lloyd has been murdered by being strangled and having his skull crushed. Holmes investigates and attends a garden party, disguised as a music-hall entertainer, where he correctly believes an attempt will be made on Ann's life. Hearing her cries from a nearby park he captures her assailant, who turns out to be Gabriel Mateo, out for revenge on the Brandons for the murder of his father by Ann's father in a dispute over ownership of their South American mine. His murder weapon was a bolas. Mateo also reveals that it was Moriarty who urged him to seek revenge. Holmes realises that Moriarty is using the case as a distraction from his real crime, a crime that will stir the British Empire - an attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. Holmes rushes to the Tower of London to prevent the crime, and during a struggle Moriarty falls, presumably to his death.

Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

These winds drive ocean currents and upwelling, which in turn bring nutrients to the surface and promote the growth of phytoplankton blooms. Step 3: Evaluate which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing Based on the information provided and the knowledge about monsoonal wind forcing, we can infer that the Indian Ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing because it hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue. Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue. I am facing a new situation today: Mike likes to visit places. This winter he is visiting Greenland. First, he visited Lake A, which is very small. Then he visited Lake B, which is huge. While visiting Lake B he went to a local pub. There he heard other tourists talking about two nearby glaciers, glacier C and glacier D. They said that glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier, but glacier D didn't have any snowfall. Mike is getting ready to visit those glaciers. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which glacier would have thinner ice? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to determine which of the two glaciers, C or D, would have thinner ice. From the information given in the background article, we know that: 1. Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. 2. Compression of snow squeezes out air bubbles and increases the ice density, making the ice appear blue. In the new situation, Mike has learned that: 1. Glacier C recently had a snowfall, and the snow became part of the glacier. 2. Glacier D did not have any snowfall recently. Given this information, we can reason that: 1. Glacier C, which had recent snowfall, would have experienced an influx of snow that adds to the glacier, increasing the compression process that occurs in the ice. 2. Glacier D, without any recent snowfall, has not experienced a new influx of snow, which would mean there is less material contributing to the compression process of the ice. Therefore, based on the information available, we can conclude that Glacier D would have thinner ice, as it did not experience any recent snowfall to further compress the ice and increase the ice density."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Will the ocean water near The Minninnippi or The Cedar have less oxygen? Two rivers, The Minninnippi and The Cedar, flow into the same ocean.

As a result, Nelson kept Craig in the basement, perhaps as a form of punishment or as a way to exert control over Craig. This conveys that it was Nelson who was fortunate enough to catch someone, in this case, Craig, in an unauthorized area or engaging in some sort of inappropriate or unwanted behavior. Option B, \\"Craig was fortunate enough to catch someone where they shouldn't be,\\" would not make sense in this context, as it would imply that Craig was the one who caught someone, which would contradict the first part of the sentence where it says that Nelson kept Craig in the basement. Overall, choice A fits the context of the sentence and provides a logical explanation as to why Nelson kept Craig in the basement.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: The perimeter pieces are the 4 pieces of metal that form the rectangle for the trailer’s base. For this trailer, use 2 length pieces 6 feet (1.8 m) long and 2 width pieces 4 feet (1.2 m) long. Either buy 4 pieces cut to this length, or buy a longer piece and cut it to size yourself. For this trailer, you’ll need 20 feet (6.1 m), or 240 inches (610 cm), of steel total for the base. Buy enough to complete the job. If you’re building your trailer to different dimensions, then adjust this step to meet your needs. Use a protractor and measure a 45-degree angle into both sides of each perimeter piece. Make sure the angles on each base piece are facing the same direction. Then use a power saw or miter saw and cut the angle into each piece. Miter saws are best to use here because you can adjust the saw to the angle you want to cut. This ensures you get a proper, 45-degree angle. Most power saws can cut metal, but be sure to use a blade designed for metal. Always wear goggles and gloves when cutting metal. A welding mask would be even better, because cutting metal produces sparks. Once the angles are cut, lay out the trailer perimeter. Work on a flat surface, like your driveway or garage floor. Lay out one of the 6 ft (1.8 m) pieces. Then fit a 4 ft (1.2 m) piece into each corner. Lay down the last 6 ft (1.8 m) piece to complete the rectangle. Push the pieces together so there is as little space between them as possible. If you aren’t sure if you’re working on a flat surface, put a level on the floor and check. the perimeter pieces together. With the perimeter formed, fasten the pieces together. Use a blowtorch or similar welding tool and weld along the corners of the rectangle. Weld all the areas you can reach first. Then let the metal cool down and flip it over so you can reach the bottom. Make sure there are no openings or holes in your weld spots. This keeps water out and prevents rusting. You can rent welding equipment from hardware stores, or buy it if you prefer. Wear a welding mask, thick gloves, and a leather apron while you weld. Never touch metal right after you welded it. Wait for everything to cool down first. Use the same type of steel beams you used for the perimeter. Measure the width between the 2 longer sections of the perimeter. Then cut a piece of steel to that length. Fit it in between the length pieces to make sure it fits snuggly. Don’t worry if it’s a tight fit or if you have to press the piece in. It should fit tight so it welds better. Measure the trailer lengthwise and find the halfway point. Mark this off with chalk. Then fit the support beam into this spot and weld it in place. Summary:","completion":"We need to make a rectangle shape for the base of a trailer using 4 metal pieces: 2 long ones and 2 short ones. To do this, we cut the metal pieces with a special saw, making sure the angles are right. Next, we put the pieces together like a puzzle on a flat surface and connect them by melting the metal at the corners. Remember to be safe by wearing special clothing and waiting for the metal to cool down before touching it. Lastly, we add a support beam in the middle of the trailer to make it stronger."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The food we eat seems to have profound effects on our health.

They believed Pollard was with her 33-year-old girlfriend Dayna Kenney, who works as her personal security guard. At large: Stripper Kiaira Pollard, left, is on the run with her lesbian lover Dayna Kenney, right, after the children she left home alone were killed in a fire. But she surrendered to police on Wednesday with her attorney who said she is \\"anguished by the loss of her children\\".

Pollard became a fugitive on Tuesday, a day after police filed charges against her in connection with the June 30 tragedy. She handed herself in at 3.45pm on Wednesday. Pollard's attorney, Fred Rabner, said: 'This is a tragedy for all involved.' He added that his client had been too distraught to provide many facts about the case. Both boys were killed when the fire took hold of the flat in North Versailles. Brothers in arms: The boys were never far apart. When Pollard eventually arrived from work on the fateful night she told officers a babysitter must have left the children home alone. Pollard then frantically tried to call the sitter to no avail. Witnesses said when she arrived she shouted: 'That's my apartment! My babies! Where's the babysitter?' Police later checked Pollard's record and found she never made a call. Talented: KiDonn was a straight-A student. They were first at the scene but could not get through the locked front steel door, which fire fighters had to break down. Neighbours, interviewed at the time, said Pollard was an attentive mother who would never leave her boys at home on their own. But police thought otherwise charging her with homicide, endangering the welfare of. children and tampering with a smoke detector. A maintenance man told officers the smoke detector was missing during an annual inspection two days before. the fire but he had replaced it.

Before she handed herself in Allegheny County Police Lieutenant Andrew Schurman said Kenney and Pollard 'travel as a pair'. He added: 'She's (Pollard's) girlfriend, and they share a residence.' Investigators believe the blaze started accidentally at 2.30am next to an air conditioner in the apartment. A friend of Pollard's told police she drove her to work at 10 or 11pm the night before the fire and didn't see a babysitter. Pollard refused to give detectives contact information for the babysitter when they requested it on several occasions after the fire. The boys' funeral took place amid emotional scenes earlier this month. Pollard sobbed and leaned on others as she walked toward the lone white casket holding her sons. Relatives cried out when the casket was closed. KiDonn was expected to join a programme for gifted pupils. KrisDon was said to be fond of Power Rangers and was known as 'Fatty'.

Wordsworth's poetry focused on the beauty of nature, the spiritual quality of the natural world, the connection between humans and nature, and an emphasis on the individual's emotional and imaginative response to life. John \\"Walking\\" Stewart was a philosopher and traveler, known for walking tirelessly across various countries. He had an extensive influence on William Wordsworth's thought and poetry, primarily because of his philosophical ideas that merged science, religion, and ethics. Stewart believed that the universe was a 'plenum' filled with a subtle, universal substance that connected all living beings and endowed them with a moral quality. This view had a profound effect on Wordsworth's perception of nature and the moral significance of individual experiences and emotions.

He is being held on 75 million bail as a flight risk. Essa left the country and went to Beirut after being questioned by police. He was arrested in Cyprus and extradited last week, nearly 4 years after wife's death. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: \\"Yazeed Essa Pleads Not Guilty: Held on 75 Million Bail on Charges of Wife's Cyanide Murder\\" Article: Dr. Yazeed Essa, accused of his wife's cyanide poisoning, pled not guilty in court this week. He is currently being held on a staggering 75 million bail following concerns of him posing a flight risk. Essa becomes the focal point of a complex international chase after reportedly leaving the country subsequent to police interrogations. An initial step in creating this report is to present clear and concise information about the case. Key facts and current developments should be examined to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the events at hand. Thus, the introductory part of the article focuses on Dr. Essa's plea and his current circumstance, painting an overall picture of the situation. Four years ago, Essa's wife tragically passed away - a death that has now led to cyanide poisoning allegations against her husband. Police began their investigations by questioning Essa, after which he abruptly left the United States, reportedly heading to Beirut, Lebanon. Notably, considering the severity of his wife’s death and the ongoing investigation, this abrupt departure from the country raised suspicions about his involvement in the crime. This piece of information is significant as it creates a timeline and outlines the primary reasons pointing to Essa as a suspect. The case took a distinct international turn when Essa was arrested in Cyprus, marking him an international flight risk. This came after a near four-year manhunt, putting Essa back in the hands of U.S. jurisdiction where he was extradited last week. Including this piece of information is crucial as it emphasizes the international efforts that went into capturing Essa and highlights the gravity of the charges against him. Essa’s return to U.S. soil coincides with the onset of his trial. Held on a 75 million bail, the court justified such a high amount citing Essa as a significant flight risk. This shows the court's determination to keep Essa within their jurisdiction and underlines their precautionary measures against a potential escape attempt. In conclusion, Dr. Essa's plea of not guilty in the face of such damning evidence lays the groundwork for a compelling court case. His past actions of leaving the country after his wife's questionable death speaks volumes about his potential involvement. This case captivates attention with its international implications, high-stakes bail, and the chilling allegations lain against Essa. The case continues, and the world keenly watches as the legal system wrangles with Dr. Yazeed Essa’s plea of not guilty in a high-profile case of potential cyanide murder. In concluding the article, it's necessary to tie all the main points together. The case's international implications, the high-stake bail, and the chilling allegations against Essa are highlighted. Furthermore, a sense of anticipation for the ongoing trial is created to maintain reader interest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They say money was taken from their contactless payment cards – even when they did not try to use them – at stores including Marks & Spencer. The latest incidents come after similar complaints from shoppers at other stores and outlets. Shoppers at Marks and Spencer's Chichester branch were charged twice for items. The store takes more than 250,000 contactless card payments each week. Pret A Manger is said to be investigating claims by a customer who card was charged more than 11 inches from the reader. Shoppers say the M&S Smile cards. were charged without their permission while they were paying with a. standard bank card or cash. The. system, which can be used for goods worth up to £20, is supposed to. work only when the cards are placed within two inches of special. terminals at the checkout. But. customers who got in touch with the Money Box show on Radio 4 said they. were charged when the plastic was in their purse and well away from the. readers – meaning they unwittingly paid twice. And. sandwich chain Pret A Manger is said to be investigating similar claims. by a customer whose card was more than 11inches from a reader. A. victim of the M&S error, identified only as Rosemary, told Money. Box her Smile card was activated about a foot away from the reader at a. store in Chichester, West Sussex – even though she was paying with her. Lloyds debit card instead. She said: ‘I put my card into the reader and the assistant was asking whether or not I wanted cash back. ‘Before. I could answer, the transaction came up as complete and the till issued. a receipt, so I hadn’t put in a PIN at all at that stage. I. queried it with an assistant and she looked rather puzzled and looked. at the receipt and compared it to my card and realised that the numbers. didn’t tally.’ The number on the receipt belonged to the Smile card, which had been in her purse. She was given a full refund. Another. shopper, Paula, said she put her NatWest card into the terminal at a. London M&S store, only to find her contactless card was also charged. – even though it was in her purse. She was given her money back when she returned to the store with a bank statement. The errors have raised fears that other shoppers may have been double charged without their knowledge. M&S takes more than 250,000 contactless payments a week from the system, introduced last year, which it uses in all 644 of its UK stores. The retailer admitted receiving five complaints and said refunds were issued where double payments had been made. A spokesman said the system was ‘robust and fit for purpose’ but wanted to hear from any customer who had experienced the error. The system uses a weak radio signal to read data from the card’s chip. Visa Europe, which supplies the technology, said reports of involuntary payments were ‘extremely rare’ and it was working with M&S to examine the problem. The UK Cards Association, which represents debit and credit card firms, said: ‘We do think there is a bit more we can do in educating cardholders to tell them not to put their wallet down in this quite narrow field when they pay. There is perhaps more shops can do in terms of cashiers knowing there are two forms of payment.’","completion":"A new generation of debit cards may be hitting shoppers with phantom charges, according to recent complaints.

It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation . - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources. - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include: - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation. - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention. - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal. - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics. - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan. - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\" - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\" What entity does 'similarity ' has the relation 'facet of' with? A:","completion":"Similarity has the relation 'facet of' with cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and perception. In the context of cognitive psychology and cognitive science, similarity is considered as a mental process that influences how individuals group, compare, and categorize different stimuli, representations, or concepts. Within the realm of perception, similarity plays an important role in how people process and organize the sensory information they receive from the environment, such as grouping similar colors, shapes, or textures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

Former British surgeon Andrew Wakefield became famous in 1998 with his publication Of his research paper which claimed that the vaccine MMR was linked with which human condition ? What is the answer?","completion":"Andrew Wakefield, a former British surgeon and medical researcher, gained notoriety in 1998 with the publication of a research paper that claimed a link between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the development of autism in children. Wakefield's study, published in the prestigious medical journal The Lancet, suggested that the MMR vaccine, commonly administered to young children, was associated with the onset of autism and inflammatory bowel disease. The human condition mentioned in his paper is autism, a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a person's communication, social interaction, and cognitive functioning. Autism is characterized by a wide range of symptoms and behaviors, which can range from mild to severe. People with the disorder may experience difficulties with communication, forming relationships, and adapting to new situations and environments. Wakefield's paper received significant media attention at the time, leading to widespread public concern about the safety of the MMR vaccine and a substantial decline in vaccination rates in the United Kingdom and other countries. The controversy ignited an ongoing debate about vaccination safety and parental choice. However, after further investigation, Wakefield's research was discredited, and the alleged link between the MMR vaccine and autism was debunked. Numerous studies conducted following Wakefield's paper found no evidence supporting his claims. In fact, the scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism. In 2004, an investigative journalist revealed that Wakefield had significant conflicts of interest and had been funded by lawyers seeking to build a case against the vaccine manufacturers, casting doubt on the credibility of his findings. Wakefield's research methods were also found to be flawed and unethical, as the study consisted of only 12 children, which is not a large enough sample size to draw meaningful conclusions, and some parents of the children involved reported that data from their children were misrepresented. In 2010, The Lancet retracted Wakefield's paper, citing biases in patient selection and inadequate ethical approval for the study. The British General Medical Council revoked Wakefield's medical license, deeming him \\"dishonest, irresponsible, and showed callous disregard for the distress and pain of children.\\" Wakefield's study has been recognized as one of the most significant cases of scientific fraud. In summary, the human condition that former surgeon Andrew Wakefield claimed to be linked with the MMR vaccine is autism. However, his research paper has been discredited, and the scientific consensus is that there is no link between vaccines and autism. His study is now considered an example of scientific misconduct, and public health organizations continue to emphasize the importance of vaccination to protect children from preventable diseases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: Graves disease is a thyroid gland that overproduces thyroid hormone. Given the two facts above, what increases the rate of metabolism in cells? Choose from: (A). heat energy; (B). heating liquids; (C). Smoking; (D). adding heat; (E). cigarettes; (F). smoking cigarettes; (G). Graves disease; (H). Dehydration;","completion":"(G). Graves disease Given the two facts provided, it can be deduced that thyroid hormones are responsible for increasing the rate of metabolism in cells throughout the body. Fact 1 states that thyroid hormones have this effect, and Fact 2 informs us that Graves disease causes the thyroid gland to overproduce these hormones. Consequently, individuals with Graves disease are likely to experience an increased rate of metabolism. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder wherein the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones play a crucial role in managing various bodily functions, including metabolism and the utilization of energy. When the thyroid gland is over-functioning, as in Graves disease, it can lead to a condition known as hyperthyroidism, characterized by symptoms like weight loss, rapid heartbeat, nervousness, irritability, and heat intolerance.

Background: Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski (February 19, 1918 - October 30, 2009) was an American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator. He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1938 to 1940 and with the Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks in 1942. Evashevski served as the head football coach at Hamilton College in 1941, Washington State University from 1950 to 1951, and the University of Iowa from 1952 to 1960, compiling a career record of 68-35-6. Evashevski's 1958 Iowa team went 8-1-1, winning the Big Ten Conference title and defeating the California Golden Bears in the 1959 Rose Bowl. Context: \\"People in the Midwest are my people and I wanted to be back among them...And, of course, I don't have to tell you what I think of Big Ten football. It's the best in the country.\\" With those words, Evashevski left the Palouse in eastern Washington to become the University of Iowa's 19th head football coach. Evashevski nearly took the head coaching job at Indiana University, but Fritz Crisler urged him to consider Iowa. He felt that it would be easier to attain statewide support at Iowa than in Indiana, where Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame shared the spotlight. Evashevski was familiar with Iowa City from his stint with the Naval Pre-Flight School. Crisler was the man who recommended Evashevski to Iowa's athletic director, Paul Brechler. Crisler did warn Brechler, however, that Evashevski was \\"a tough, stubborn Polack, and you might have to put the reins on him.\\" In 1952, Iowa football had only had three winning seasons in the previous 16 years. Iowa had also gone without a Big Ten Conference title for three decades. A United Press International story named three football programs in 1952 with new coaches that would struggle to ever be competitive: Iowa, Indiana, and Pittsburgh. Iowa's first two opponents in 1952 were Pittsburgh and Indiana, and Iowa lost to both, starting the year 0-2. But Evashevski knew the Hawkeye program could be resurrected. When he came to Iowa, Evashevski was asked by a writer, \\"Do you think Iowa could ever really have a consistently winning team?\\" Evashevski snapped, \\"Why in the hell do you think I took the job?\\" Afterwards, a photographer noted, \\"I think that man truly believes he's the savior of Iowa football.\\" Question: what made him a good coach?. Whats the answer?","completion":"What made Forest \\"Evy\\" Evashevski a good coach was his belief in himself and his ability to turn the football program around. He was confident, determined, and passionate about the sport. He also had a strong background in playing and coaching football, which helped him understand how to build a winning team. Additionally, he was able to connect with the people in the Midwest and gain their support, as he considered them \\"his people.\\" All of these factors combined made him a good coach who could lead his team to success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - The liver takes in blood from the rest of the body - The liver uses enzymes to clean the blood - The cleaned blood is expelled - The liver creates bile from the items filtered - The liver takes energy and stores it as glycogen - The bile is sent to the intestines. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You go to more A A meetings happens, how will it affect A person consumes more alcohol over time than they should. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis question proposes a scenario in which a person attends more Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings while simultaneously consuming more alcohol over time than they should. The question asks whether this proposed perturbation has an effect (direct or indirect) on the liver's blood processing as described in the given sequence. Attending more AA meetings is intended to help an individual reduce their alcohol consumption. However, if the person continues to consume excessive alcohol despite attending more AA meetings, the direct impact on the liver's blood processing process will mostly come from the increased alcohol intake, rather than the increased attendance at AA meetings. Excessive alcohol consumption affects the liver in several ways: 1. Enzyme Production: The liver is responsible for producing enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, that break down alcohol in the blood. When a person consumes alcohol, these enzymes get to work detoxifying and breaking down the alcohol into less harmful substances. However, excessive alcohol intake over an extended period can lead to an increase in enzyme production, which may lead to oxidative stress and liver cell damage. 2. Fat Accumulation: The liver also plays a role in breaking down and metabolizing fats. When a person consumes too much alcohol, it can interfere with the liver's ability to metabolize fats, which could lead to a buildup of fat within the liver cells (a condition called fatty liver disease). 3. Scar Tissue: Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver cells, which in turn could result in the formation of scar tissue. This is called liver fibrosis. Over time, as more scar tissue accumulates, it may lead to cirrhosis, a severe form of liver scarring that impairs the liver's ability to function properly. 4. Reduced ability to process blood: As the liver becomes damaged from excessive alcohol intake, its ability to cleanse the blood, produce bile, store glycogen, and perform other essential functions may be impaired. This could eventually lead to liver failure if the damage is not addressed. In summary, while attending more AA meetings may not have a direct effect on the liver blood processing process, the increased alcohol consumption associated with it has a significant impact. This perturbation is detrimental to the liver's function and overall health. Therefore, it is essential for the individual to seek professional help and support in reducing their alcohol consumption to prevent further liver damage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship. Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey. Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India. The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs. The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost 150. In the second, 1,500. \\"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \\" Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to 1,500. \\"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \\" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night. The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year. \\"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest. The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after. And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers. \\"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when... Question: What do the two experiments have in common? ( ) - They got similar findings. - They were carried out in the rural areas. - They were carried out by economists only. - They chose two groups of people with different income.

Scott), a composer living in New York, New York, moves cross-country to Washington state following the deaths of his wife and daughter in a traffic accident while on a winter vacation in upstate New York. In suburban Seattle, John rents a large, old and eerie Victorian-era mansion and begins piecing his life back together. However, John soon discovers that he has unexpected and unwelcome company in his new home: the unhappy ghost of a murdered young boy. The ghost makes its presence felt by various phenomena such as shattering windows, abruptly opening and shutting doors, and manifesting itself dramatically during a seance. John investigates the identity of the dead child and finds that the mystery is linked to a powerful local family, the heir of which is a wealthy United States senator, Joseph Carmichael. John subsequently discovers that the real Joseph Carmichael (who was born in 1900) was murdered in 1906 by his father, Richard. Joseph was a crippled, sickly child, and in the event of his death before his 21st birthday, the family fortune (which in 1905, he inherited from his late maternal grandfather) would pass to charity. Desperate to keep control of the fortune, Joseph's father drowned young Joseph in the bathtub, secretly replaced him with a healthy orphan, and took the orphan to Europe in the guise of seeking a treatment or cure. He returned several years later with the impostor, now grown and \\"cured\\" of his illness, and continued as if nothing had happened. Now, the ghost of the real Joseph haunts the house, making great efforts to persuade John to investigate his murder, and give him some form of justice. John's investigation leads him to a property that was once owned by the Carmichael family, and after convincing Mrs. Gray (the owner of the property and whose daughter has seen Joseph's ghost), John discovers the skeletal remains of Joseph in a well underneath the house, as well as his birth medal.

A:","completion":"No, the statement provided does not directly describe Galileo Galilei's personality. Instead, it depicts specific events and reactions from his life. Interpretation of one's personality should be generally comprehensive and cover their characteristics or traits such as being determined, curious, confrontational, etc. To proceed with this task, we first need to understand what personality refers to, which is an individual's unique patterns of thought, feelings, and behavior that are persistent over time. The statement provided describes an event where Galileo defended his views, which may imply perseverance and being true to his science in face of opposition (courage). It also suggests that he might have been confrontational, if not also strategic or manipulative (as inferred from the indirect attack). Still, this single instance should not be generalized as his overall personality as it is not a holistic representation. If more information about Galileo is provided or available, especially concerning his traits, behaviors in different situations, reactions etc. over a period of time, we would be in a better position to comment on his personality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Hammer-ons and pull-offs are two essential techniques to use if you're soloing on guitar. With a hammer-on, you basically tap the string with your finger on a higher fret to play another note without strumming. A pull-off is the reverse, when you remove a finger on a higher fret so that the string plays a lower note. When done correctly, the 2 notes slur together, creating a smoother sound. And since you don't have to strum each note separately, you can play much faster. Combine the techniques and go back and forth between 2 notes for several beats to create a sort of trill in your solo. This works well at the end of phrases. It's commonly understood that lead guitarists play single notes rather than chords – but there's no rule that says you can never play a chord just because you're the lead guitarist. Use chords to add body to root notes in your solo or emphasize a particular phrase. For example, if you used whole notes to build the basic outline of the structure of your solo, you could play some or all of those notes as chords, then fill in with single notes in between. To bend a string, fret it with 2 fingers and pull it across the fingerboard. As the string gets tighter, the pitch will go up. Pull from your wrist to bend the string, using your fingers as levers. This puts less pressure on your fingers and wrist by distributing the effort. Don't try to bend a string if it's not in tune. You could break the string. If you've never bent strings before, it's a technique that will take some practice to get right. Play the note you want to bend, then the note you want to bend the string to. That way you'll know when you've bent it far enough. Vibrato is a technique similar to string bending, except that you gently move the string up and down for a slight variation in pitch. Lock your fretting finger against the neck of your guitar to get a good pivot point, then wobble that finger up and down after strumming the note. Vibrato is more difficult on the outside strings, since you don't want to pull the strings off the side of the neck. Experiment with your vibrato, doing it at different speeds and bending the string at different distances. A small, slow vibrato is typically more appropriate for ballads while bending the string further and faster works well with rock songs. Listen to guitarists you admire and watch their solo technique. If you see something you like, practice it and try to emulate it. The same goes for motifs or riffs that capture your attention. Simply copying others won't make you a great guitarist. Once you've learned how to emulate someone else's idea, play around with it and try to make it your own. All guitarists have influences, but the greatest have a signature style that builds on their influences rather than mimicking them.","completion":"This article teaches different techniques to make your guitar solo sound better, such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, using chords, bending strings, vibrato, and learning from other guitarists to develop your own style."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and answer the question.

Given the question: Information: - \\"These Eyes\\" is a song by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist Randy Bachman and lead singer Burton Cummings and originally included on the band's 1969 album \\"Wheatfield Soul\\". It was first released as a single (backed by \\"Lightfoot\\"), in their native Canada, where its chart success (#7), along with the influence of CKLW-AM Windsor's radio station music director Rosalie Trombley, helped land them a U.S. distribution deal with RCA Records. It was then released in the U.S. In March 1969, and became a breakthrough success for the group, as it would be their first single to reach the top ten on the \\"Billboard\\" Pop Singles chart, peaking at number six, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies. While it was actually the 18th single released by the band, it was the first from the quartet of Cummings, Bachman, Jim Kale, and Garry Peterson as produced by Jack Richardson. - Share the Land is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band The Guess Who. After the departure of Randy Bachman, the band brought in two guitarists, Kurt Winter and Greg Leskiw. - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. - BachmanTurner Overdrive is a Canadian rock group from Winnipeg, Manitoba, that had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (ten in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \\"gearheads\\" (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \\"Let It Ride\\", \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\", \\"Takin' Care of Business\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Roll On Down the Highway\\", still receive play on classic-rock stations. - Power pop is a popular musical genre that draws its inspiration from 1960s British and American rock music. It typically incorporates a combination of musical devices such as strong melodies, clear vocals and crisp vocal harmonies, economical arrangements and prominent guitar riffs. Instrumental solos are usually kept to a minimum, and blues elements are largely downplayed. - \`\` Star Baby '' is a 1974 hit song by The Guess Who . It was written by Burton Cummings who also provided the lead vocals . It is classified in the genre of Power pop and was included on the group 's LP entitled , Road Food as well as The Guess Who - Greatest Hits in 1999 and The Guess Who - Anthology in 2003 . \`\` Star Baby '' reached # 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and # 30 on the Cash Box Top 100 . In Canada , the song spent three weeks at # 9 . The song is ranked as the 92nd biggest Canadian hit of 1974 . Although The Guess Who had a dozen higher - charting songs in the U.S. , \`\` Star Baby '' remained on the chart longer than any of their other hits . It stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 for 19 weeks which was 4 weeks longer than their number one hit \`\` American Woman '' . Chicago radio superstation WLS , which gave the song much airplay for years , ranked \`\` Star Baby '' as the 37th most popular hit of 1974 . It reached as high as # 3 for two weeks . - The Guess Who is a Canadian rock band, formed in Winnipeg in 1965. Initially gaining recognition in Canada, the group found international success from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s with many hit singles, including \\"No Time\\", \\"American Woman\\", \\"Laughing\\", \\"These Eyes\\", \\"Undun\\" and \\"Share the Land\\". The band has continued to perform and record to the present day; and at various times has included many well-known musicians, including Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman (of BachmanTurner Overdrive). Formed as a garage rock band, their musical style encompassed the pop rock and psychedelic rock genres. - Road Food is the thirteenth studio album by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who and the last to feature Kurt Winter and Don McDougall on guitars.

Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient. The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.Soil salination is the accumulation of free salts to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage. Paragraph: The city of Reslie is known for its grilled cheese sandwiches. People come from all over the world to taste their sandwiches. The mayor of Reslie, while having a meeting about how to spend the excess funds from tourism this year, was told that the city is experiencing soil piping. The neighboring city, Tichago, consumes many of Reslie's grilled cheese sandwiches. The mayor of Tichago has just received a phone call from the mayor of Reslie asking if Tichago is also having soil piping. Tichago's mayor replies that no, they are not. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Reslie need to replace their levees sooner or later than Tichago Answer:","completion":"Reslie will need to replace their levees sooner than Tichago since Reslie is experiencing soil piping, which can cause levee and dam failure. Tichago has not reported any soil piping issues."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: How do you remember the way to your house?

When New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg instructed five hospitals to evacuate their patients from Hurricane Irene's path, one replied it couldn't follow his order. Administrators from New York University-Langone Medical Center explained that six patients in the intensive care unit were so sick that moving them might kill them, and so the mayor's office gave permission to keep them in the hospital throughout the storm. It then fell to Elaine Rowinski, nurse manager of the intensive care unit, to find seven nurses willing to stay at the hospital, right in the hurricane's predicted path and just 100 yards from the East River, which many feared would overflow. It turned out she had nothing to worry about. \\"I could have had 20 nurses if I'd needed them,\\" she said. \\"That's how many called me up to volunteer.\\" Rowinski stayed at the hospital all weekend as the doctors and nurses who also stayed listened to the wind and the rain through the boarded-up windows. \\"I had no qualms about staying, no fears at all,\\" she said. \\"We train for these disasters.\\" Brainstorming with her staff, Rowinski came up with a list of what they might need during the storm. The nurses kept flashlights by each bedside and plugged machines into the red outlets on the wall, which connect to the generators on top of the building, in case they lost power from Con Edison. They also kept a three-day supply of medicine next to each patient's bed in the event they needed to evacuate quickly. About 200 staff members stayed at NYU, including engineers, security guards, housekeepers, blood bank staff, and two doctors. Four family members stayed all weekend with the patients. Some of the patients had neurological diseases, while others had respiratory problems or infectious diseases. Many were on life support, but those that were conscious were told Friday they might have to be evacuated. \\"They were so relieved when they found out they could stay,\\" Rowinski said. As for Rowinski, she finally went home Monday afternoon after nearly three days straight at the hospital. While she was working, her husband had to evacuate their house in Oceanside, on Long Island. \\"He told me he kept a picture of me by the dog so he'd remember me,\\" she said with a laugh.

About 200 staff members remained at the hospital, and four family members stayed with their critically ill relatives.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person the Kinks third album was named after? In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. Answer:","completion":"Anning"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can't believe that I've written 399 reviews already. To celebrate the 400th review, I saved it for one of the best meals/experience I ever had. Its no wonder the man is named Chef of the Century. His namesake restaurant incorporates attention to food and service like no other restaurant I've been to. After reading reviews from fellow yelpers, I knew I had to call a week ahead to ask for a limo reservation. On the night of our reservation, a gold limo came to pick us up at the Mandalay Bay. It drove us to the MGM and dropped us off right in front of the secret entrance to the MGM residences in the back of the hotel. We got a quick glimpse of the place as we walked through it. The garden courtyard, looked like an outdoor garden, was actually indoors. Our hostess told us a night in one of these rooms start at 10K. I guess I'll just stick with the free walkthrough of the place instead. The walkthrough eventually leads us back to the general public casino of the MGM, right next to Joel Robuchon and L'Atelier. Our hostess took our coats and brought stools for all the ladies' purses. Our servers quickly brought us menus and took our drink orders. Once all our orders were taken, the magic began! First up was the butter and olive oil cart. Prepared tableside, the server scrapes two layers of butter and sprinkles fleur de sel on it carefully. He explained that the butter was from Britain. Next he pours olive oil from spain into small bowls. Next up was the bread cart! I think I ate about 6 or 7 different kinds of bread. I already told myself not to eat too much in order to save room for the rest of the meal, but the bread was just so irresistible! My faves were the Milk bread, Basil bread, Bacon bread, Croissant and the Cheese brioche (in no particular order). The first time they bring the bread cart around to take everyone's order, they'll actually bring the bread back to the kitchen to warm it up. Afterwards, they just bring an assorted tray around to see if anyone wants more bread. The ones on the tray don't get warmed up! They came by 4 times to offer us more bread throughout the meal. Our amuse bouche for the night was beets soup with marscapone cheese. I don't like beets, but even I found this to be quite delicious! The presentation and choice of serving ware was spot on. For the appetizer, I had the Lobster with truffle. It came with three huge pieces of perfectly cooked lobster, topped with three big pieces of winter truffles. The sauce complimented the lobster perfectly without overpowering the flavor of the truffles. The next appetizer I had was the Crispy soft boiled egg with truffles. The egg was perfect, with yolk slowly oozing out as you cut into it! For my entree, I had the chicken with foie gras. This dish required an extra supplement, which I think is totally worth it since California no longer has foie gras available. The chicken and foie gras come served in a big pot, and is presented to you tableside as the server carefully plates the contents onto a plate for you. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the foie gras was so rich. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit salty for my taste. For dessert, I had the Herb sorbet with sabayon. This was the perfect palate cleanser. So refreshing yet the perfect sweet ending to the meal. One of my friends ordered the sugar sphere with orange mousse. This was an amazing presentation. The clear and shiny sphere of sugar was filled with orange mousse. It was really too beautiful to crack open to eat! And of course the best part of the meal, the dessert cart, comes to finish off our experience here. The cart has over 40 things. By the time the server went through everything on the cart, I already forgot what were the items he mentioned in the beginning. But he was so patient with us and answered our questions as we pointed and asked him what certain items were again and again. The cart has small candies and chocolates, to french macarons, to lollipops and marshmallows, to even small desserts (creme brulee, panna cotta). I felt like a little kid in a candy store! My favorite items were the yuzu truffle, the blueberry cheesecake bite, and the pineapple pop. Before our meal came to an end, the server brought all the ladies at the table a gift bag. It came with a loaf of cake and a glossy picture book of the dishes at the restaurant (some of them were the ones we ate). When we were about ready to go, we let the hostess know for her to get the limo ready. Once the limo arrived, she walked us back through the MGM residences to our limo which took us back to the Mandalay Bay. Overall, this place is worth every single penny. The experience as a whole was flawless. Service was spot on, food was beyond expectations, and presentation of everything was a masterpiece. Every dish looked too beautiful to eat!

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. I am facing a new situation today: Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beaker will have a slower rate of reaction? Answer:","completion":"Beaker A will have a slower rate of reaction, as it is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature. Lower temperatures result in reactant particles having less energy and moving slower, leading to fewer and less forceful collisions, and thus, a slower rate of reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal Nanking massacre. As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their convent at a Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. Here, John Miller (Bale), an American mortician on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls. He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party.

Tags blocks bram12 bricks building gravity physics tetris tower Add punctuation","completion":"Tags: blocks, bram12, bricks, building, gravity, physics, Tetris, tower. The fascinating combination of physics, building, and skill that can be found in blocks, bricks, and Tetris games has captivated the minds of millions. The elements of gravity and tower building are essential for stability and success, whether in a physical construction or a virtual world. Let's delve into the intricacies of these components and how they all work together to create a challenging and enjoyable experience in building and video games. At the core of many building games such as Tetris is the concept of gravity, which follows the fundamental principle that objects are drawn toward the center of the Earth. The force exerted by gravity on objects is integral in determining their overall stability. In the context of Tetris, gravity also significantly affects gameplay, with its force determining the speed at which blocks descend. The versatile element of bricks is integral to both building and Tetris. Bricks, made of materials such as concrete, clay, or even virtual polygons, are the building blocks used to construct structures. In Tetris, these bricks are represented by the Tetriminos, which are the different shapes and pieces that players must stack neatly in a limited space. Bricks and Tetriminos follow similar principles of interlocking, with each piece needing to fit securely and precisely to create a stable structure. When focusing on tower-building or physics-based games, constructing a stable and enduring structure is the primary objective. To do this, factors such as gravity, weight distribution, and balance must be considered. Tetris, in particular, provides a challenge in this aspect, as failing to maintain stability results in a cluttered game board or, in the case of physical structures, a collapsed tower. The bram12 tag is quite ambiguous, but one potential interpretation could refer to the culmination of the various elements explored so far. An amalgamation of blocks, bricks, Tetriminos, and physics principles into a single game or structure would place strong emphasis on gravity, stacking, and block manipulation as the primary facets of gameplay. In conclusion, the intricate relationship between blocks, bricks, building, gravity, and physics makes for an incredibly engaging experience. Tower building and Tetris games test users' spatial awareness, quick thinking, and strategy, all while adhering to the rules of physics. These components all work together harmoniously to present challenges that captivate casual and advanced gamers or builders alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me.I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water.Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned. Answer:","completion":"This review would decrease the chances of me buying the product. Step 1: Analyze the content of the review. The review talks about the shaver failing to work in a shower, resulting in water damage to the interior and electronics. The user mentioned that the manual did not warn against using it in the shower. Step 2: Consider the reliability of the source. The review seems genuine as it is based on the user's personal experience with the product and the manufacturer's response when they sought repair assistance. Step 3: Evaluate the significance of the issue mentioned. Usage of a shaver in a shower is a common practice and knowing that this particular product is not fit for that purpose raises concerns about its durability and design. Step 4: Consider the impact of the manufacturer's response. The manufacturer's refusal to accept responsibility for the water damage or fix the issue without charging the customer might indicate poor customer service, which is another negative aspect to consider. Step 5: Make a decision based on the information. Based on the user's negative experience with both the product and the manufacturer's response, the likelihood of buying this shaver decreases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Better senses have a positive impact on an animal 's survival, and animals behave in a variety of ways which enhance their chances of survival and reproduction. Given these facts, animals with better what have a positive chance of reproduction among the following options: - hormones - senses - glycogen - traits - pigeons - standards - morals - ideas The answer to this question is:","completion":"senses and traits. Here's why: 1. Senses: Animals with better senses typically have higher survival rates and, thus, more chances of reproduction as they can better detect predators and find food and mates in their environment. These include senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. For example, an eagle has sharp vision that enables it to spot prey from high above the ground, or a wolf has a strong sense of smell to locate its pack and prey. 2. Traits: Traits refer to certain behaviors or physical characteristics that enhance an animal's ability to survive and reproduce. These are often the result of adaptation to specific environmental conditions. For instance, camouflage is a common survival trait in many species - the chameleon changes its color to blend with the surroundings to conceal itself from predators. Animals with advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce and pass these beneficial traits to the next generations; this process is known as natural selection. Hormones and glycogen play vital roles in the functioning of the body, but in itself, 'better' hormones or glycogen would not necessarily increase chances of reproduction. Pigeons, standards, morals, and ideas are irrelevant to the context of the question as they are not biological factors that could directly improve an animal's chances of survival and reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts. A:","completion":"In the given article, Lumpus is scared after Lazlo goes missing primarily due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, rather than concern for Lazlo's well-being. The story involves Lazlo, Raj, Clam, and their experiences with Edward, the camp bully. Lumpus, the camp leader, is dissatisfied with the behavior of the three new scouts, and as a result, he is anxious about how their actions will be perceived by Commander Hoo-Ha. When Lazlo leaves the camp to help an animal in distress, he comes across a bear named Fluffy, who becomes grateful to Lazlo for removing a pinecone stuck in its nose. Lazlo hides Fluffy in his cabin, and when Edward informs Lumpus that Lazlo is missing, they try to confront him. However, they are instead met by Fluffy, who attacks them to protect Lazlo. This causes everyone, including Lumpus, to hide in Lumpus' cabin. Later on, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp, and when his torn Bean Scout cap is found in a gory mess the following day, the other campers assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. This further intensifies Lumpus' fear, as he is now faced with not only the potential wrath of Commander Hoo-Ha but also the possible tragic outcome for Lazlo. Edward then fabricates a story about how he supposedly scared off Fluffy with his \\"skills,\\" pretending to be the hero who saved the camp from the bear. This deception only adds to Lumpus' worry and confusion about the situation. The subsequent series of scenes illustrates Lumpus grappling with Lazlo's disappearance and Edward's lies. Lumpus' fear for Lazlo is mainly driven by his anxiety about how Commander Hoo-Ha will react to the incident, suggesting that his primary concern is for his own position and the potential consequences that could arise from Lazlo's absence, rather than genuine worry for Lazlo's well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Casting directors are usually tired, overworked, and have seen many other actors before you. Stand out by being energetic and friendly. Greet the casting director by introducing yourself. Shake their hand, if offered. The casting director may ask you to state your full name into the camera and turn to one side to see how you appear on camera. As you perform the script, make sure you pronounce your words clearly and loudly. Do not mumble or speak too low, as this will negatively impact your audition. Speak slowly and take your time. Use a positive, upbeat tone. As you will have the script memorized, look up at the casting director and make eye contact as you perform. Most casting directors are looking for actors who can be natural on camera, especially for television commercials. Try not to appear too staged in your audition. Project sincerity and honesty when you perform. Act like yourself. You may find your first read is much stiffer and staged than your second read. Try to relax, take deep breaths, and act more natural on your second read, if you are asked for one. After you do a first read, the casting director may ask you to improvise or give variety. Change up how you approach the script. Alter your voice and your body language. Do a different character or persona when you perform the script. Most casting directors will ask you to do this so it is smart to have a few alternative interpretations of the script on hand for the audition. The casting director may give you suggestions on how to perform the script or adjustments you can make on your second read. Always follow their instruction. Respond positively to their feedback and use it to make your performance better. Being able to take feedback from the casting director and run with it will show them that you are adaptable. It will also make it clear that you want the part and are willing to act as required to get it. At the end of the audition, you should thank the casting director, smile, and tell them you look forward to hearing from them. Leave the room on a positive note to increase your chances of getting the job. Then, wait for a callback from the casting director. You will usually get a callback within one week of the audition. Summary:","completion":"When you go to an audition, remember to smile, be polite, and bring energy.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

Answer the following question: how many seasons did michael jordan play in the nba?","completion":"Michael Jordan, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, played a total of 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). His illustrious career was divided into three distinct phases. The first phase of Jordan's NBA career was with the Chicago Bulls, which spanned 13 seasons. He began his professional basketball journey when the Chicago Bulls selected him as the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan played for the Bulls from the 1984-85 season to the 1992-93 season, before temporarily retiring from basketball for the first time. This phase is often referred to as his prime years, during which he helped the Bulls win their first-ever NBA Championship and create a modern basketball dynasty. The team won three consecutive championships, known as a \\"three-peat,\\" from 1991 to 1993. In October 1993, Jordan decided to retire and pursue a career in baseball, citing a loss of desire to play basketball and the tragic murder of his father earlier that year. Jordan signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox and spent the 1994 season playing baseball. The second phase began when Jordan returned to the NBA and rejoined the Chicago Bulls during the 1994-95 season. He announced his return with a simple yet powerful statement: \\"I'm back.\\" Even though he had been away from basketball for over a year, Jordan's skills and impact on the Bulls were undeniable. He led them to another three-peat from 1996 to 1998, bringing the Bulls' total championship count to six during Jordan's tenure. After claiming his sixth and final NBA title, Jordan retired from the league once more in January 1999. The third and final phase of Jordan's career occurred when he came out of retirement for a second time to play for the Washington Wizards. He signed with the team in September 2001 and played for two seasons, from 2001-2002 to 2002-2003. While his statistics during this period were still respectable, he was no longer the dominant force he had been during his glory days in Chicago. Ultimately, Jordan retired for the last time in April 2003. In summary, Michael Jordan played a total of 15 seasons in the NBA, with 13 seasons for the Chicago Bulls (1984-1993, 1995-1998) and 2 seasons for the Washington Wizards (2001-2003). His legendary contributions to the sport of basketball remain unmatched, and his influence continues to be felt on and off the court."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - The guanaco (\\"Lama guanicoe\\"), a camelid native to South America, stands between at the shoulder and weighs . Its color varies very little (unlike the domestic llama), ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath. Guanacos have grey faces and small, straight ears. - Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos. - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicuña and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña , not the guanaco . - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance. - The vicuña (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms. - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world.

This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

Article: Corn snakes spend a lot of time hiding in the wild, so your corn snake will need places to hide to make them feel safe. You can turn anything into a hiding spot as long as your corn snake can hide completely so it’s not seen. It should be large enough for your snake to get inside and move around, but snug so the snake can touch the sides and feel secure. Hiding spots are essential to your snake’s health. Make sure the material the hide is made out of is easily cleaned and replaced. For example, you can make hides out of drip trays, litter boxes, or plastic tubs. Place one hide on the warm side and another on the cool side. You can even place a hide in the middle. This allows them to be secure on either side. Corn snakes are partially arboreal snakes, which means they spend time in trees and like to climb. You can provide artificial plants and climbing branches in the vivarium. This will provide stimulation, comfort, and more hiding places. This is great for enrichment. Artificial plants, leafed vines, and other artificial foliage can be placed anywhere throughout the vivarium. Try to provide more than one plant. This will give your snake a range of spots to climb and relax. Make a climbing branch or buy one from your local pet store. They can be placed wherever you like but make sure the snake can climb on it, it can handle the snake’s weight, and it’s small enough for the snake to curl around. You should always provide your pet snake with a water bowl filled with fresh, bottled water. They should be able to drink whenever they want. You can buy any type of water bowl as long as it will fit in the cage. The snake should be able to get their entire body inside the bowl to soak. Do not use tap water as it contains chlorine and fluoride which are toxic to your snake. Water softeners add too much sodium to the water, and distilled water removes nutrients your snake needs, so give your snake spring water. However, tap water can be used if left out for 24 hours. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany do not have chlorine in their tap water so tap water from these places is safe. Reptisafe is a great way to surest water. It’s cheap, convenient, and adds beneficial things to the water. Clean the bowl once each week, and clean and disinfect it immediately if the snake messes in it. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: To ensure the health and well-being of corn snakes in captivity, it is essential to provide adequate hiding spots, climbing opportunities, and proper hydration.

Please answer the following question: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"The Modi Government banned the 500 and 1000 rupee notes in a surprise move on November 8, 2016. This decision, known as demonetization, had several objectives behind it: 1. Combatting corruption: Banning high-denomination notes was an attempt to target the black money in circulation. Black money refers to income generated through illegal activities or undeclared income that is not taxed. High-denomination notes, such as the 500 and 1000 rupee notes, were commonly used to store and exchange black money, so by banning these notes, the government aimed to reduce corruption and recover undeclared income. 2. Curtailing counterfeit currency: Counterfeit currency has been a persistent problem in India, affecting the credibility and stability of the economy. Banning the 500 and 1000 rupee notes and replacing them with new designs made it harder for counterfeiters to replicate the currency, thereby curbing the circulation of fake notes and strengthening the economy. 3. Encouraging digitalization: The government wanted to promote digital transactions and a cashless economy, which can enhance transparency and reduce tax evasion. The demonetization announcement created a temporary shortage of cash, encouraging people to switch to digital payment methods, such as mobile wallets and digital banking. 4. Tackling terrorism financing: Banning high-denomination notes was also aimed at disrupting the financing channels for terrorism and other illegal activities, which often rely on cash transactions to avoid detection by authorities. However, the sudden nature of this decision led to acute cash shortages and significant economic disruption. Informal sectors and small businesses, which heavily relied on cash transactions, were particularly affected, and many people faced difficulties in exchanging their old notes for new ones. Despite these challenges, the Reserve Bank of India eventually replaced the discontinued 500 and 1000 rupee notes with new 500 and 2000 rupee notes featuring enhanced security features, design improvements, and cleaner manufacturing processes. Regarding the two questions posed: \\"Why has the Modi Government banned the 500 and 1000 rupee notes?\\" and \\"Why is 500 and 1000 rupee notes discontinued?\\", it can be inferred that these two questions are, in fact, paraphrases of each other. Both inquire about the reasons behind the discontinuation of 500 and 1000 rupee notes by the Modi Government. While there might be slight differences in phrasing and the focus of the questions, their core essence remains the same – understanding the rationale behind the decision to ban these high-denomination notes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite attempting to stop the robbery, Dooley and Kane find themselves outmatched by the thieves and their use of machine guns. Based on this plot, a potential question to generate could be: How do Frank Dooley and Norman Kane work together to expose the true identity of the armed robbers, uncovering the connection between the security guard's union and the criminal activity occurring at Carlex Pharmaceutical Company's warehouse? This question addresses the central conflict of the movie plot while also creating room for discussing the protagonists' teamwork, their character development, and the potential motives behind the involvement of Klepper, Lazarus, and the union in the criminal activities at the warehouse.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In the past few decades, Japanese cuisine has acquired global appeal. Japanese restaurants have sprung up almost all over the world. In Kyoto, the Heihachi Tea House boasts a 430-year-old tradition that the owners have kept all in the family. The tea house has been operated by twenty generations of the Sonobe family. The Heihachi Tea House, in the northern part of Kyoto, is one of the city's oldest business establishments. It is said to have opened in 1576. The present owner, Sonobe Heihachi, who is also the chef, represents the 20th generation of the Sonobe family to oversee the tea house. Sonobe Heihachi, restaurant owner, said, \\"During the middle of the Edo era, from 1603 to 1868, it became customary for commoners to dine in mat rooms. The Heihachi Tea House specialized in a dish comprised of rice with barley . It then became an inn and a little later, a restaurant.\\" Like every other chef, Sonobe Heihachi's day often begins at the market where he personally selects ingredients that will be served to his customers. The restaurant specializes in a style of cuisine known as Kaiseki Ryori--possibly the ultimate in Japanese cooking. It offers both fresh and ocean fishes on its menu, including bream and eels. The owner's son Sonobe Shingo is also an accomplished chef. His skills include the elaborate cutting of a \\"daikon\\" radish into strips. Later they will be shredded into thin strands to form part of the garnish for sashimi. Sonobe Shingo admits that when it comes to the small details of running the business, father and son have different ways of thinking. Sometimes they clash. But they share a passion for what they do and continue to preserve an innovative and deeply rooted culinary tradition. Question: We can infer from this passage that Shingo differs with his father _ .

Gill's journey began in rural Ohio, where he spent his childhood before pursuing higher education. His commitment to academia led him to the University of Michigan Law School, an esteemed institution that honed his skills in the legal profession. Armed with his degree, Gill made a conscientious decision to apply his expertise in law through political and public service. Gill's political career was marked by his affiliation with the Republican Party, a testament to his belief in strong federal governance, economic development, and a commitment to civil rights. He initially followed in the footsteps of Lorenzo Danford, the congressman whom he eventually succeeded in office. Their shared party affiliation and political direction illustrate the strong traditions within the Republican Party and the district they represented. J.J. Gill's tenure in the United States House of Representatives started on December 4, 1899, when he assumed office as the representative of Ohio's 16th District. Throughout his term, Gill consistently advocated for the interests of his constituents, ensuring that their needs were met and their voices heard on the national stage. However, Gill's time in the office was relatively short-lived. His term ended abruptly on October 31, 1903, paving the way for Capell L.

Try to remember that there is nothing to be embarrassed about, and if it is lipedema, the earlier you catch the disorder, the more treatable it will be. The first answer is incorrect because, although lipedema might require additional examinations, a gastroenterologist is not the right specialist to diagnose lipedema. Lipedema is a fat disorder, and a gastroenterologist deals with disorders related to the digestive system. The third answer is wrong because it implies that if there are changes in one's general health, they might not need further treatment for lipedema. This does not make sense as changes in health may indicate the necessity for further diagnostic or treatment steps, not avoid them. The fourth answer is incorrect because it discusses kidney problems, which are not relevant to lipedema.

Before you begin placing the newspaper in the paste, and onto the balloon, you should create a space where you can work. Paper mâché can get messy, so simply lay down a plastic table cloth or some old newspaper on the floor or on the table, so that any excess will drip onto the plastic or paper instead of on the table or carpet. Dip one strip of newspaper at a time into the paper mache paste and then lay it flat across the surface of the balloon. Repeat with your other strips, laying them onto the balloon both vertically and horizontally until it is completely covered in newspaper. When done, the balloon should be covered by roughly five coats of newspaper. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/ff/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/ff/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg/aid4280445-v4-728px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-11Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Cover the entire balloon except for a small patch near the knotted end. You will need this space to remain open so that you can get the balloon out of the structure later. Set the paper mache structure aside in a dry, draft free area. Allow it to dry undisturbed for about 24 hours, or until the surface is still and completely dry to the touch. The paste needs to be completely dry before you continue past this step. Your climate will change the rate at which the paste dries. If you live in dry conditions, the paste will dry quicker. If you live in notably humid conditions, the paste might need more than 24 hours to dry. Use a pin to pop the balloon through the gap you left at the base of the paper mâché. After popping the balloon, carefully pull it out through the hole. Use scissors to cut off the bottom of the structure, then cut away a circular section for your face to show through. Work from the bottom or open end of the structure. Cut off enough of the bottom for your neck and head to fit through. {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d6/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg/v4-460px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/d/d6/Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg/aid4280445-v4-728px-Make-a-Space-Helmet-Step-14Bullet1.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Still working from the bottom end, cut a rectangle in the front of the structure.

Question: Aside from being defined as a meeting hall, what other definition does falekaupule have? Is Falekaupule is also used as the name of the council of elders – the traditional decision making body on each island. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the answer you provided is a good starting point for the question. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, you can expand on the concept and cultural significance of Falekaupule. Here's a more in-depth response: Falekaupule, aside from being defined as a meeting hall, is also commonly known as the name of the council of elders on each island in Tuvalu, an island nation in the South Pacific. The term can be broken down into two parts: \\"fale,\\" which means house or building, and \\"kaupule,\\" referring to a group of traditional chiefs or elders who make decisions affecting the community. Therefore, Falekaupule more broadly symbolizes traditional leadership and governance in Tuvalu. In the cultural context of Tuvalu, the Falekaupule assumes an important role in preserving the islands' unique customs and social order. The council consists of traditional leaders from each family, district, or island depending on the local structure. While the members who make up the Falekaupule may vary between islands, their main responsibility remains the same: to provide guidance, maintain order, and make decisions concerning their community. The Falekaupule is far more than just a council of elders. It represents a significant link to the ancient Polynesian way of life. Decisions made by the Falekaupule are guided by the principles of consensus and reciprocity, reflecting the values of cooperation and coexistence inherent in Tuvaluan society. The Falekaupule serves as a mediator, resolving disputes and fostering harmony within the community. The traditional leaders also play an essential role in ensuring the continuity of cultural knowledge, rituals, and traditions, passing this wisdom from one generation to the next. Moreover, the physical space of the Falekaupule meeting hall holds essential cultural and symbolic importance. The traditional architecture of the building reflects the expertise of the Tuvaluan people in using locally sourced materials, such as coconut fronds, pandanus leaves, and timber, to create a sturdy and functional space. The open design of the structure facilitates communal gatherings, promotes inclusiveness and provides a venue for cultural ceremonies and events. Consequently, Falekaupule is not only a center of decision-making and governance but also a vital space for preserving and celebrating the cultural heritage of Tuvalu. In conclusion, Falekaupule carries multiple layers of meaning. While primarily referring to the council of elders and the meeting hall, it also embodies the traditional leadership and governance system in Tuvalu. Furthermore, the Falekaupule symbolizes the people's strong connection to their cultural heritage and their commitment to preserving ancient traditions and knowledge for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If ice is preventing the release of your parking brake, warming up the car can help melt the ice and free the brake. Start the car and leave it running for at least 10 minutes before attempting to release the parking brake. Options are: (1). Inspect the parking brake and cable for ice. The parking brake is connected to the brake shoe on one of your tires by a thin black cable. (2). Another option if the parking brake has a cold setting is to use a loose pull-down button. This will help to keep the parking brake loosened and cool down the car until the vehicle completely warms up again. (3). Before attempting to release the parking brake, prop open the hood of the car with one hand and tilt the lower right rear tire forward slightly to allow the room to release more of the ice.

This fits the context of the paragraph, as it helps the reader understand how to allocate time and effort to different types of decisions. (I) is incorrect, as it talks about an unavoidable response, which is not related to the importance or scale of the decision. (III) is incorrect, as it is discussing various categories but not providing a clear connection to making a quick decision or the scale of the decision.

The statement \\"hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before\\" suggests that the characters within the movie do not seem to be believable or convincing to the reviewer, potentially due to poor character development, story inconsistencies, or weak acting. This can lead to a criticism and reflect negatively on the viewer's overall experience.

A group of residents has come forward claiming that they have experienced abusive treatment at the hands of a clique of body corporate and community members. This article will delve into the claims, the whistleblowers leading the charge against the group, and their efforts to create awareness about the concerning situation. Abuse, Harassment, and Bullying Allegations Several Aveo retirement residents have bravely spoken out about the alleged maltreatment they have received from a clique of their fellow community members. Accusations of abuse, harassment, and bullying are now being openly discussed, causing significant concern and unrest within the close-knit retirement community. Those affected have claimed that the purported harassers are members of the body corporate and have been exploiting their positions to engage in this unacceptable behavior. Illegal Alcohol Production and Sale Adding fuel to the fire are allegations of illegal activities taking place within the Aveo community. It has been reported that a still is in operation, and that senior citizens are producing and selling bottles of alcohol to other residents. Each bottle is sold for 10, generating additional income for the involved individuals. The illegality of this operation has raised grave concerns regarding the conduct of certain residents who are participating in and profiting from these activities. The Whistleblowers: Jon and June Withers At the forefront of the fight against the abusive group are Aveo residents Jon Withers and his wife, June. The couple has taken it upon themselves to publicly call out the problematic behavior of the clique and encourage other affected residents to do the same. Their determination to confront this issue head-on is commendable and has led to the creation of a platform for their fellow community members. Creating Awareness: Facebook Page In their quest for justice and awareness, Jon and June have created a Facebook page dedicated to giving voice to other residents who may be suffering in silence. This platform has ensured that concerns are openly discussed, and serves as a support system for those who wish to share their experiences with others in similar situations. The Facebook page has already garnered significant attention, as more residents are beginning to speak up and strengthen the call for action to remedy the disquieting atmosphere within the Aveo retirement community. Conclusion The appalling allegations of abuse, harassment, bullying, and illegal activities within the Aveo retirement community are undoubtedly causing apprehension and unease among its residents. The courage and determination of Jon and June Withers, as well as the other whistleblowers, have brought these disturbing claims to light. Their efforts to create a safe and open platform for affected residents to voice their concerns is an essential step towards addressing this disturbing situation.

Could anyone on the palace wall have seen her walk over the Petit-Pont? Not Amalric. He was still in the south, the King having just appointed him seneschal for Beziers and the surrounding country. But he had so many agents in Paris and allies at court. Except for Agnes, all the servants in the Gobignon town house were loyal to him. His aunt, Queen Blanche, was forever praising him to all who would listen. If Nicolette were involved in scandal, the White Queen would be furious, and would see to it that word reached Amalric. And if indeed he found out about her meeting the troubadour? Just a message, a song, let alone a meeting like this one, could mean death for her and Orlando. I should turn around right now, cross this bridge, and run back to the palace. The streets of the Latin Quarter were crawling with ruffians and criminals - it was insane for her to be walking here alone after sunset. The sight of the small knife she carried under her cloak might deter an attacker, but then she would be discovered. If I screamed for help, the whole palace would find out. Blanche would demand to know why I was here. No, she thought, her blood turning to ice, she would know why. But those eyes of his? to look into them again, was that not worth any risk? She stood, vacillating, in the shadows by a wooden house that overhung the Rue Saint-Jacques. I must see Orlando, she thought. Over a year now, and I have not been able to forget him. She longed just to be alone with him and have him take her in his arms. When the White Queen finds out that Nicolette left, she is: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Excited B.

The drink comes from the corn, and we need to follow some super cool steps to make it just right! Are you ready? Let's begin! First, we will \\"strain the corn mash.\\" Imagine you just helped your mom make some delicious corn soup, and now you want just the liquid part, without the solid corn pieces. To do this, you take a strainer or a big net and pour the corn soup through it. The liquid will pass through the strainer, and the corn pieces stay on top, so you have separated them! That's the same thing as \\"straining the corn mash.\\" Pretty cool and easy, right? Next, we will \\"aerate the wort.\\" Oh, that's a fancy word! Let's break it down. \\"Aerate\\" means to mix air into something. When you blow bubbles into your chocolate milk with a straw, you are aerating it! \\"Wort\\" is another name for the liquid part of our corn soup we just strained. So, to \\"aerate the wort,\\" we need to mix air into our corn liquid. We can do this by stirring it really fast or shaking it in a jar - now it's filled with tiny bubbles so that our drink will taste even better! Finally, we'll \\"take a specific gravity reading.\\" Hmmm, now that sounds really scientific, but don't worry, it's still fun! \\"Specific gravity\\" is just a fancy way to measure how thick or thin our corn drink is. We want our drink to be just perfect, not too watery or too thick. To do this, we use a special tool called a \\"hydrometer.\\" The hydrometer looks like a small, thin toy boat with numbers on the side. When we put it in our corn liquid, it will float and show us a number. The number will tell us if our drink is just right! Wow, we did it! We strained the corn mash, aerated the wort, and took a specific gravity reading, all to make our perfect corn mash drink. Now we know how to make something super yummy and fun!

The nearby Hawthorne Army Depot is the primary economic base of the town. Hypothesis: Hawthorne is the biggest city in Mineral County.","completion":"No, the hypothesis that \\"Hawthorne is the biggest city in Mineral County\\" cannot be definitively drawn from the provided context. From the information provided, we know that Hawthorne is a census-designated place (CDP) in Mineral County, Nevada, and that it is the county seat of Mineral County. However, being a county seat does not necessarily imply that it is the biggest city in the county based on area or population. A county seat is the administrative center or capital of a county where the government offices are located. While it can be one of the larger or the largest city in the county, this is not a consistent rule and can vary widely depending on the location. As for size, no information about the size or area of Hawthorne relative to other cities in Mineral County is provided. The size of a city can be measured in various dimensions such as geographical area, population, etc. Regarding population, while the context does provide some information about the population of Hawthorne, it does not provide any information about the populations of other cities in Mineral County for comparison. From the data given, we have learned that the population of Hawthorne has decreased from 3,311 in 2000 to 3,269 in 2010. However, without knowing the populations of other cities in Mineral County during those years (either for the same years or on a comparative trajectory), we cannot conclude whether Hawthorne has the highest population and thus whether it is the \\"biggest\\" in that respect. Therefore, the context does not provide sufficient information to conclude that Hawthorne is the largest city in Mineral County, by either geographical area or population. Further data would be needed about other cities in the county for a comprehensive comparison before coming to such a determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided supposes that more waste decomposition occurs, and we are asked to analyze how this would affect less methane production. To address this hypothesis, let's first revisit the processes mentioned: 1. People breathe and expel carbon dioxide. 2. Engines produce carbon dioxide. 3. Living things produce waste. 4. Waste decomposes. 5. Decomposition produces methane. 6. Water evaporates. 7. Water vapor joins the atmosphere. 8. Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis and its potential effects on the process: If there is an increase in waste decomposition, that would mean there is a higher amount of waste available for the decomposition process to occur. As a result, this increase in waste decomposition would directly lead to more methane production (process #5), not less methane production as supposed. Since the perturbation hypothesis states that more waste decomposes, it is not consistent with the proposed effect of less methane production. Instead, it would have the opposite effect, causing an increase in methane production. This increase in methane production will have the following direct and indirect effects on the other processes: 1. Direct effect: A higher concentration of methane will be released into the atmosphere (process #8), contributing to the overall levels of greenhouse gases present. 2. Indirect effects: The rise in methane concentration may impact the carbon dioxide levels (processes #1 and #2) and water vapor content in the atmosphere (processes #6 and #7) due to interactions among the greenhouse gases. This could influence climate and weather patterns, as well as increase global warming potential. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis of more waste decomposition has a direct effect on increased methane production (contrary to the proposed effect of less methane production). This directly impacts the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and indirectly affects the overall balance of carbon dioxide and water vapor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Story highlights Daughter of slain groundskeeper \\"is not expected to survive,\\" school leader says Police had contact with gunman when he was a juvenile in 2006 Gunman and a relative were enrolled in college in 2010 Gunman kills SUV driver near campus and then a woman near school library The gunman's rampage began at a home in this beachfront city, where two were found dead inside. Then he carjacked a woman and fired at a public bus. It all ended when police shot him dead at Santa Monica College as students studied for finals, a mile from the house. His blood trail, however, left four people dead Friday in Santa Monica, which abuts Los Angeles and is renowned for its liberal openness. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that the gunman had suffered mental health issues. A couple of years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official. It's not clear whether the state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released. Authorities have found no link to domestic or international terror, the official added. The gunman has been identified, but his name won't be released until authorities reach his family members, who are believed to be outside the United States, city Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said Saturday. The gunman and a family member had been enrolled in the college as recently as 2010. The gunman, 23, would have turned 24 on Saturday, Seabrooks said. Police had contact with the gunman in 2006, but because he was a juvenile then, authorities couldn't release further information Saturday, Seabrooks said. One of the four persons killed in Friday's shooting rampage was shot outside the library of Santa Monica College, college Police Chief Albert Vasquez said. Another victim shot dead was identified as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, who resided in one of Los Angeles' west neighborhoods near Santa Monica, authorities said. He was the driver of an SUV who was gunned down on the campus, police said. Franco was with his youngest daughter, Marcela, who was going to buy textbooks for her studies at California State University, Dominguez Hills, Santa Monica College President Chui Tsang said in a statement Saturday. The daughter, 26, was shot and is in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center \\"and is not expected to survive,\\" said Tsang. Alfred Creollo, a relative who lives in the same building as the family, said that Carlos Franco had worked as a groundskeeper and been with Santa Monica College for 30 years -- though he wasn't working the day of the shooting. This isn't the first tragedy to hit the family, Tsang notes: Carlos Franco's son died two summers ago in a car accident. \\"He was a dedicated husband, dedicated to his family, he was a good person,\\" Creollo said. \\"We lived here together for 30 years. It was just a devastating blow to hear what happened to him.\\" The three other victims have not yet been identified. The two-year college remained closed Saturday as police combed the crime scene for clues to the rampage, which began shortly before noon at an acquaintance's house in one of Santa Monica's breezy neighborhoods. The gunman, shot by police, died of multiple gunshot wounds, the Santa Monica police chief said. Investigators are still trying to determine the motive in the shootings that left five people wounded, Seabrooks told reporters Saturday. A woman is in grave condition and her prognosis is not good, Seabrooks said. The gunman had addresses connected to the house where the rampage began and to a residence in Los Angeles' Palms neighborhood, Seabrooks said. The shooting spree at several locations in Santa Monica lasted 13 minutes, though the house was apparently set afire before the shooting began, police said. Given that gunman was wearing a ballistic vest and heavily armed, \\"I would say it's premeditated,\\" said Seabrooks, who estimated that the shooter had some 1,300 rounds of ammunition during the spree. Dressed in black and toting an assault-style rifle, the man's apparently random gunfire became the nation's latest disturbing killing spree, ending with his death in the college library and leaving this tourist beachfront city reeling with shock. A neighbor's account Jerry Cunningham stepped onto her porch when she heard the shots. She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house, which was also on fire. The neighborhood, regarded as working class, sits beside Interstate 10 -- \\"the last affordable area in Santa Monica,\\" with houses under 1 million, said nearby resident Carmen Franco, 47, who's not related to the killed victim. \\"Nobody can afford to buy now here in Santa Monica,\\" where houses are easily seven figures, she added. The area's only trailer park is on the other side of the highway. Investigators believe the gunman knew the dead people in the house, but police were unsure of the connection. The fire began in the front room of the 1,000-square-foot house, and the two bodies were found in a back room, Fire Chief Scott Ferguson said. No accelerant was found, he added. Cunningham then observed the gunman force at gunpoint a woman to stop her car. Another car approached. The gunman waved it by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman \\"fired three shots directly into her and the car,\\" Cunningham said. The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said. That driver was hospitalized and is in stable condition, authorities said. The gunman then got into the first car and forced the woman to drive off with him, police said. During their ride, 911 calls poured in, keeping police on the gunman's path, said Sgt. Richard Lewis, a spokesman for the Santa Monica police. As the car headed toward the campus of the community college, where 30,000 students are registered, he opened fire on a passing bus, slightly wounding three people, Lewis said. He was carrying an \\"AR-15 style rifle,\\" pistols and \\"more clips for the rifle,\\" Lewis said. Police have described the shooter as a 25- to 30-year-old man who was dressed in black and wearing a tactical vest. As the car pulled onto the campus, the man fired into Franco's red SUV, killing him and critically wounding his passenger, police said. Franco's vehicle crashed after the shooting, Lewis said. The gunman then abandoned the hijacked vehicle -- leaving the driver unhurt -- and fled on foot, shooting at police, Lewis said. On campus College employee Joe Orcutt saw the firefight between the man and officers and took off running, but ran the wrong way and found himself facing the gunman. \\"He looked over at me, and I looked at him,\\" Orcutt said. \\"He just panned his gun and trained it on me, and I just jumped behind the building and he shot at me.\\" The gunman was \\"very calm, not running around.\\" He was just \\"looking around for targets very casually,\\" he said. \\"He just looked like he was standing there posing for the cover of an ammo magazine or something. It was bizarre.\\" Inside a classroom Jasmine Franco, 22, was in a classroom at Santa Monica College -- next to the library -- waiting for her English class to start at noon on Thursday. Little did she know that the gunman began his rampage at a house near to where she and her mother, Carmen, live. Jasmine Franco's friend had left the room to fill his water bottle and she was sitting alone when she first became aware something was wrong. \\"You could hear rumbling, a lot of rumbling, it sounded like an earthquake or something,\\" she said, referring to the sounds of gunfire mixed with the footfalls of people running. But her 11 classmates and the teacher appeared oblivious, and continued their banter until her friend burst back in. \\"His whole face was red and his veins were coming out of his neck, he was trying to calm himself,\\" Franco said. \\"I'm entirely serious,\\" she said he told them. \\"There's a shooter on campus.\\" He told the class he had heard a gun unload. \\"He said it just sprayed and unloaded tons of rounds.\\" Not knowing what to do, \\"We just sat there.\\" The teacher left the classroom to see what he could learn and, moments later, ran back inside. \\"He says, 'They just unloaded a magazine.' He said there was a lot of bullets.\\" At that moment, the door to the hallway locked shut -- automatically -- with a click, she said. Outside the classroom, she could see dozens of people fleeing on the cement. \\"We could see people running with their backpacks,\\" Franco said. \\"No screaming, just running. We could just hear feet and running.\\" Inside the library As the killer ran, he fatally shot a woman, then burst into the campus library, said Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks. Another woman -- who asked not to be identified -- said she was in the building when she heard a gunshot. She took off. In a hallway, she saw a dark-haired man in black combat boots who she initially thought was a police officer, but quickly realized was the shooter. The man was walking quietly and casually. She and a colleague ran; gunshots rang out. Priscilla Morales said that, when she and her friends looked out a library window and saw people running, they grabbed their belongings and prepared to leave, too, but didn't get far. \\"As we open the door, we hear three gunshots,\\" she said. So they closed the door and hid. \\"I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die,\\" she said. \\"Drop it!\\" she heard police say, then heard gunshots and a man's screams. The officers had shot the gunman, Lewis said. Police said that, with the exception of his first two victims in the off-campus house, all of the other victims appear to have been chosen at random. \\"My heart goes out to the families of the victims of these tragic shootings in Santa Monica, and I am praying for the recovery of those who were injured,\\" said U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California. At the time of the shootings, President Barack Obama was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser a 10-minute drive from the campus, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported. His schedule was not affected. Back in the classroom Franco's classroom ended up waiting three hours before police arrived. During that time, some students followed events on Twitter, but the reports of people being shot and a house burned down seemed unconnected and far-fetched. \\"Everything's hearsay,\\" Franco said. \\"People tell you one thing, but you have no clue what's happening. You just don't know anything. The best thing to do is not worry about it. Sit down.\\" People kept opening the classroom door, which infuriated Franco. \\"You're not supposed to open the door,\\" she said. \\"I'm just like, 'No, we're not going to do that.'\\" Though they could see police from classroom windows, \\"no one came to check on us\\" for more than two hours, she said. Tan-uniformed officers with big guns finally arrived and escorted students out with their hands on their heads for security -- \\"like inmates,\\" Franco said. Officers shouted \\"Go! Go! Go!\\" But at least the class was safe. Franco called her mother, who also drove home some classmates whose cars were inaccessible behind yellow police tape. \\"I went home and fell asleep,\\" Franco said. ||||| The gunman who went on a chaotic rampage killing four people before being fatally shot by police at a college campus planned the attack and was capable of firing 1,300 rounds of ammunition, the police chief said Saturday.

(Associated Press) \\"Any time someone puts on a vest, of some sort, comes out with a bag full of loaded magazines, has an extra receiver, has a handgun and has a semi-automatic rifle, carjacks folks, goes to a college, kills more people and has to be neutralized at the hands of the police, I would say that that's premeditated,\\" Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said. The killer would have turned 24 on Saturday, but Seabrooks wouldn't identify him because his next of kin was out of the country. Police had an encounter with him seven years ago, but she wouldn't elaborate because he was a juvenile at the time. The chief spoke near a display of weapons and ammo recovered from Santa Monica College where the killings ended Friday when police gunned the suspect down in the library, where students were studying for finals. Among the items on display were surveillance photos of a man in black entering the library with an assault-style rifle by his side. The gunman fatally shot one woman in the head outside the library before entering the building and opening fire as students ran for cover. Students fled into what Seabrooks called a \\"safe room\\" in the library and barricaded the door for safety. \\"They stacked items found in the safe room against the door, hunkered down and avoided shots fired through the drywall at them while they were in that room,\\" she said. The violence, which lasted a little more than 10 minutes, started about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away when the gunman began shooting at a house, and it caught on fire. Two bodies were later found inside. Two officials told The Associated Press that the killings began as a domestic violence incident and the victims in the home were the gunman's father and brother. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the case. As flames rose from the house, the man, wearing what appeared to be a ballistic jacket, shot a woman passing by in a car and carjacked another woman at gunpoint. He directed her to drive to the college campus, having her stop so he could shoot along the way, police said. He fired on a city bus where three women were left with minor injuries. One had shrapnel-type injuries and the two others had injuries not related to gunfire. They were treated at a hospital and released. The gunman also fired on police cars, bystanders and pedestrians, police said. From there, the chaos shifted to the college, a two-year school with about 34,000 students located among homes and strip malls more than a mile (1.6 kilometers) inland from the city's famous pier, promenade and expansive, sandy beaches. In a faculty parking lot on the edge of campus, he fired on two people in a red Ford Explorer that crashed through a block wall. The driver was killed, police said, and a passenger was in critical condition after undergoing surgery at UCLA Medical Center, doctors said. On Saturday, authorities identified the driver as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, of West Los Angeles, who worked at the school. College employee Joe Orcutt was in the lot and said the gunman looked calm and composed as he fired at him. Orcutt jumped out of the way. \\"He's just standing there, like he's modeling for some ammo magazine,\\" Orcutt said, \\"seeing who he could shoot, one bullet at a time, like target practice.\\" __ Associated Press writers Greg Risling and Sarah Parvini contributed to this story. Tami Abdollah can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/latams ||||| The gunman accused of killing four people in a Santa Monica shooting rampage Friday was apparently angry over his parents' divorce and had some mental health issues in the past, a law enforcement source told The Times. The suspect was identified by five law enforcement sources in Washington and Los Angeles as John Zawahri, in his 20s. Other sources with knowledge of the investigation said detectives believe the shooting was sparked by a family dispute of some kind but emphasized that the investigation was still in its early stages. The suspect's past mental health issues occurred when he was juvenile, the law enforcement source said, but no further details were offered. The sources all spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing. These sources said the alleged gunman's first victims were his father and brother, whose bodies were found in a burning home. One thing the investigators were trying to figure out is why the suspect wanted to be driven to Santa Monica College, where he was ultimately killed by police. Police have stressed that the rampage was not a \\"school shooting\\" and that the violence occurred in many places and happened to end on the campus. But a woman who was carjacked by the alleged gunman said he specifically asked to be taken to the college. \\"You're going to drive me to Santa Monica College and let me out,\\" Laura Sisk, 41, of Culver City recalled the suspect saying in an interview with The Times. As of Saturday morning, law enforcement sources said they did not believe the college was the target. Police were expected to hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Saturday. The first signs of trouble came about 11:50 a.m. Friday, when gunshots rang out in the vicinity of Kansas and Yorkshire avenues, in a quiet neighborhood near the 10 Freeway. Jerry Cunningham-Rathner had just watched her son walk out the front door of her home a few minutes earlier when she heard the shots. She rushed outside, fearing he had been hit. Instead, looking across the street, she saw a house engulfed in flames. A man standing in front of the house was dressed all in black, with an ammunition belt around his waist and a large rifle in his hands, she said. \\"He looked like a SWAT officer,\\" she said. Firefighters later found the bodies of two men inside the house. Police sources said the men were Samir Zawahri, 55, the owner of the house and the father of the alleged gunman, and one of his adult sons. Cunningham-Rathner looked on in horror as two cars approached. She said the man pointed his weapon at the first, a Mazda hatchback, and yelled at the driver to stop. Cunningham-Rathner said he motioned for the woman driving the second car to keep moving. When she hesitated, the man opened fire on her silver Infiniti, wounding the driver slightly. Sisk, the driver in the first car, froze, she said. She knew President Obama was in town for an event a few miles away and thought momentarily the man might be a Secret Service agent. She quickly realized that wasn't the case. She begged him to take the car instead. \\"No. You're driving,\\" he said. Before getting into the passenger's seat next to Sisk, witnesses said, the gunman fired several shots around the neighborhood with what authorities later said was an \\"AR-15-style\\" semiautomatic rifle. |||||Summary:","completion":"A gunman in Santa Monica, California went on a shooting rampage in 2013, killing four people and injuring others before being shot dead by police at a college campus. The attacker, John Zawahri, had a history of mental health issues and was reportedly angry over his parents' divorce. The shooting rampage began at his family home where his father and brother were killed. Zawahri then carjacked a woman, forcing her to drive him towards Santa Monica College, shooting at people along the way. Wearing a ballistic vest and heavily armed, investigators believe the attack was premeditated. After Zawahri was shot by police in the college library, authorities found no link to domestic or international terror."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: An early form of a game in which a ball was kicked around a field is recorded in 1004 B.C. Japan. Some sports historians believe that the game of soccer began in England in the third century, however. They say that early English warriors kicked around the head of a killed enemy. This may or may not be true, but it is certain that soccer is an ancient sport. Without doubt, the English played soccer during the times of King Edward I in the 1300s. In fact, the king passed a law against playing it. The law said, \\"There is great noise ... caused by kicking large balls from which many ghosts may appear.\\" Anyone caught playing soccer at that time was put into prison. Two hundred years later, Queen Elizabeth I still had people put into prison for playing this \\" _ \\" sport. Although there were such laws, soccer grew more popular. In 1681 it became an official sport in England. By the 1800s, people throughout the country played soccer. By the 18th century, upper-class boys played it at schools. Its popularity grew among all English people. At a meeting held in an English school in 1843, the first rules were suggested. In 1863 the heads of English soccer teams met in London to agree on some official rules. They organized an English football association . By 1871 all of the English clubs were following these rules. Today all soccer teams play by them. Soccer is called \\"football\\" everywhere but in the United States. The game is played mostly with feet. No players except the goalie ( ) may touch the ball with their hands. They may control the ball with any part of the body except their hands. Soccer is by far the world's most popular sport. Every four years, nearly every country in the world tlghts for the World Cup. Tens of billions of soccer fans from around the world watch the World Cup on television.

Second question: What is the most interesting thing to do in life? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What is the most important thing to do in life? The most important thing to do in life varies from person to person, as different people have different values, beliefs, and priorities. However, some general concepts can apply to most individuals. The following aspects encompass a few of the essential things people could focus on to lead a fulfilling life: 1. Pursuing personal growth: Striving towards self-improvement and constant learning helps you evolve as a person, expand your horizons, and achieve a higher level of satisfaction with your life. 2. Building and maintaining meaningful relationships: Human beings are social creatures by nature, and cultivating strong bonds with family members, friends, and significant others provides immense emotional support and happiness. Nurturing meaningful relationships also contributes to a strong social network and sense of belonging. 3. Career and passion: Engaging in a career or pursuing a passion that aligns with your interests, strengths, and values is essential for personal and professional fulfillment. A career or the pursuit of passion can provide meaningful work, financial stability, and a sense of purpose. 4. Maintaining health and wellbeing: Ensuring your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing is a crucial aspect of life. Engaging in regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and self-care practices like meditation and mindfulness keep you in optimal health and help you navigate life's challenges with more ease. 5. Helping others: Contributing positively to the lives of others by volunteering, giving back to your community, or simply showing kindness to those around you fosters empathy, gratitude, and personal fulfillment. Second question: What is the most interesting thing to do in life? As for the most interesting thing to do in life, this is also a highly subjective matter. People have diverse tastes, preferences, and interests. Some may find traveling and exploring new cultures to be the most exciting thing, while others may get a thrill from pursuing an avant-garde artistic career or engaging in adrenaline-pumping sports. Ultimately, the most interesting thing to do in life would be something that genuinely piques your curiosity, provides a sense of adventure, and keeps you passionately engaged. In comparing these two questions, they are not asking the same thing but rather inquire about different aspects of life. The first question seeks to identify the most critical factors that can lead to a purposeful and fulfilling life, while the second question focuses on activities that would spark excitement and make life more engaging and enjoyable. While there may be some intersections, it is important to remember that each person's answer to these questions will be highly personalized based on their values, priorities, and passions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There would not be much difference in the pronunciation, since both English and Finnish share similar phonetic characteristics. Still, you may notice a slight difference in the way a native speaker of each language, English or Finnish, would pronounce the name, primarily due to accents and phonetic tendencies. In Finnish, the 'i' would sound similar to the i in English (as in \\"bit\\" or \\"sit\\"), the first 't' would be a little more emphasized (similar to how \\"t\\" sound is pronounced in \\"stop\\" or \\"tap\\"), and so on.

Abstract: We used Doppler echocardiography to quantitate the changes in intracardiac blood flow velocities and right and left ventricular stroke volumes in 80 normal human fetuses from 19 to 40 weeks gestation. Blood flow velocity spectra across the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, and mitral valves were digitized to obtain peak velocities (m/sec) and flow velocity integrals. Aortic and pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from two-dimensional echocardiographic images and cross-sectional area was calculated assuming a circular orifice. Ventricular stroke volume was calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of a great vessel and the flow velocity integral through that vessel. The pulmonary arterial and aortic diameters increased linearly with gestational age (r = .82, r = .84), and pulmonary arterial diameter consistently exceeded aortic diameter. There was a positive relationship between stroke volume and gestational age: stroke volume increased exponentially from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 7.6 ml at 40 weeks for the right ventricle (r = .87) and from 0.7 ml at 20 weeks to 5.2 ml at 40 weeks for the left ventricle (r = .91). Similar results were obtained for right and left ventricular and combined cardiac outputs. In 44% of the fetuses it was possible to quantitate both right and left ventricular stroke volumes. There was a close correlation between right and left ventricular stroke volumes in these fetuses (r = .96) and right ventricular stroke volume exceeded left ventricular stroke volume by 28%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Question Does the following mesh terms have a suitable mesh term for the abstract? 1)Blood Flow Velocity 2)Comparative Study 3)Echocardiography 4)Fetal Heart 5)Gestational Age 6)Heart Ventricle 7)Human 8)Prospective Studies 9)Reference Values 10)Stroke Volume 11)Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S..","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Klaus both occurred in 1990 as part of the 1990 Atlantic Hurricane Season. Tropical Storm Marco developed from a tropical wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea in early October 1990. The system quickly intensified into a tropical storm and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), before it made landfall along the western Florida Panhandle. Shortly after, when Tropical Storm Marco combined with a cold front, it produced heavy rainfall in Georgia and South and North Carolina. The rain was much needed due to drought conditions that were present in this area. The flooding was significant, but it also filled reservoirs that had been at record low levels due to an ongoing drought. Despite generally positive effects in these areas, the storm also caused some damage like flooded homes and roads, and two fatalities were reported. Meanwhile, Hurricane Klaus was a minimal Atlantic hurricane that formed in the mid-Atlantic, which later brought heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles in October 1990. While not directly impacting the United States, its remnants, combined with those of Tropical Storm Marco, resulted in additional rainfall over the southeastern part of the country. Thus the rainfall from this combined system caused widespread effects in many regions. The severity and impact of these two systems highlighted the significant potential of tropical and subtropical systems to bring about extreme weather conditions, even far from the coast and after official dissipation.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, Chris Corner and Joe Walsh are both guitarists, although they come from different musical backgrounds and have distinctive styles. Chris Corner is an English musician, songwriter, and producer, best known as the founding member of the electronica and trip-hop bands Sneaker Pimps and IAMX. Born on January 23, 1974, in Middlesbrough, England, Corner started his musical journey at a young age, learning to play guitar as well as keyboards. In the 1990s, Corner formed the group Sneaker Pimps, which gained widespread recognition with their debut album, \\"Becoming X.\\" As the guitarist and supporting vocalist for the band, Corner contributed to their signature sound, combining elements of trip-hop, electronica, and alternative rock. After three albums with Sneaker Pimps, he went on to create IAMX, where he further honed his skills as a guitarist, blending them with electronic beats and unique vocal styles. Joe Walsh, on the other hand, is an American musician, singer, and songwriter, recognized as a legendary rock and roll guitarist. Born on November 20, 1947, in Wichita, Kansas, Walsh started his career in the late 1960s as a member of the bands James Gang and Barnstorm. However, it was his tenure with the iconic American rock band Eagles that catapulted him to fame, joining the group as the lead guitarist in 1975.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Heterodoxa fatuhivae\\" belongs to the category of \\"Plant\\". This is because Heterodoxa fatuhivae is a species within the botanical world. In taxonomy, every organism is classified under a hierarchical system that begins from the broadest classification - the Kingdom, down to the narrowest - the Species. As such, Heterodoxa fatuhivae references a distinct species within the vast domain of plant life. However, it’s also important to remember that the specific characterizations of the species such as its physical attributes, geographical distribution, and other unique features would vary. The plant kingdom is incredibly diverse and contains life forms that range from tiny mosses to towering trees and from aquatic plants to desert cacti. While Heterodoxa fatuhivae is less likely to be recognized by the average person compared to well-known species like roses or oak trees, it nevertheless plays its part in contributing to the richness of plant diversity and adds to the complexity of the World's ecosystems. Every plant has a scientific name that follows the binomial nomenclature system – a two-part name where the first part represents the genus and the second part signifies the species. In this particular case, Heterodoxa is the genus and fatuhivae represents the species. This naming convention, developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, is used globally to ensure clear and unambiguous communication about the identity of plant species. This nomenclature helps avoid confusion that can arise due to the presence of multiple common names for the same plant across different regions and languages. In conclusion, \\"Heterodoxa fatuhivae\\" as a title refers to a plant species within the botanical world, thereby fitting into the \\"Plant\\" category. More specifics about its character, habitat, and other detailed features would require careful investigation and research in botany and related fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project. Guess a valid title for it!

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. Terra is another name for which planet in our solar system?","completion":"Terra is another name for Earth, which is the third planet in our solar system. Earth is a unique planet that stands out among the celestial bodies owing to its distinctive features, making it the only known planet with life as we know it. Earth is mainly composed of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, sulfur, nickel, calcium, and aluminum. The planet is divided into several layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is quite dense and consists primarily of solid iron and nickel. The outer core is a fluid layer composed of the same elements and surrounds the inner core. Above the outer core, we find the thick mantle layer mainly composed of solid rocks, and finally, the crust forms Earth's surface. One of the defining characteristics of our planet is the presence of liquid water on its surface. Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and ice caps constituting the hydrosphere. Water features prominently in sustaining life on Earth, supporting the development and maintenance of a vast array of ecosystems. The atmosphere of Earth is also crucial for life maintenance. It is a thin layer of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, that envelop the planet. The atmosphere is primarily responsible for regulating temperature, preventing extreme heat during daytime and extreme cold at nighttime, by creating a greenhouse effect. Additionally, it provides protection from harmful solar radiation and space debris, such as meteoroids. Earth's biosphere, which encompasses all ecosystems and living organisms that reside within them, extends from the depths of the planet's oceans to high up in the atmosphere. Life on Earth is diverse, ranging from microscopic organisms to large, complex creatures, all interconnected through intricate ecological relationships. The Earth orbits the Sun taking about 365.25 days to complete a full orbit, giving rise to our calendar year. The planet's rotational axis is tilted at about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane, resulting in the phenomenon of seasons. Depending on the time of year and the position of Earth in its orbit, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight, creating the changes in climate and temperature that we experience as seasonal variations. In conclusion, Terra, or Earth, is the third planet in our solar system and the only known celestial body that harbors life. Its unique features – such as the presence of liquid water, a suitable atmosphere, and a diverse biosphere – make it a remarkable object of study and fascination for scientists, researchers, and the general public alike. Earth's role as our home and the source of all known life gives it an unparalleled significance in the study and understanding of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: 1). check for eavesdropper. 2). watch his back. 3). hurt Austin. Answer:","completion":"3). hurt Austin. Step 1: Analyze the context Austin has confessed his love to Sasha's wife, which is a personal matter involving Sasha's closest relationship and could be seen as a possible betrayal of friendship or trust. Step 2: Interpret Sasha's likely emotional state Given the context, Sasha is likely to feel angry or betrayed by Austin due to the confession of love to his wife. Step 3: Determine possible reactions for Sasha Considering Sasha's emotional state, he is more likely to react negatively, wanting to confront or punish Austin for his actions. Step 4: Compare each choice according to the context and Sasha's emotional state 1) Checking for eavesdroppers does not address the root of the issue, as the confession has already been overheard. 2) Watching his back might imply that Sasha feels threatened by Austin, but it doesn't fully convey the anger or betrayal that Sasha might feel. 3) Hurting Austin demonstrates a more fitting response for someone feeling angry or betrayed, as it implies a form of retaliation for Austin's actions.

Windows tried to cut down on costs by putting new software on a old computer, but the OPTIONS: (a). software size exceeded capacity.; (b). computer size exceeded capacity.; Answer:","completion":"(a). software size exceeded capacity. Windows tried to cut down on costs by putting new software on an old computer, but the software size exceeded capacity. This decision to save on expenditure initially seemed like a clever move, as it allowed the company to repurpose an outdated device which would have been otherwise cast away. However, it became apparent rather quickly that the plan had some unforeseen consequences. The new software was notably more advanced and resource-demanding than the old system that was initially installed on the computer. As a result, the computer lacked the necessary storage space, processing power, and memory to manage the increased workload effectively. This led to sluggish performance and frequent crashes, which not only slowed down productivity but also frustrated employees who had to constantly battle with the unresponsive system. To exacerbate the situation, the computer's hardware components started to struggle under the pressure. The new software put a significant strain on the old computer's processors and memory, generating increased heat and causing the cooling system to work harder than before. This situation put the various internal components at risk of damage, further reducing the overall lifespan of the device. Moreover, the new software was not fully compatible with the older generation hardware, causing compatibility issues between the system and peripheral devices like printers and scanners. As a result, employees faced difficulties in executing their day-to-day tasks, leading to lowered efficiency and even loss of important work. Recognizing the mounting issues, the company had to reevaluate its cost-cutting strategy. The initial savings achieved by utilizing an older computer were soon overshadowed by the detrimental impact it had on productivity and employee morale. In the end, it became evident that investing in a new computer – one capable of supporting the software and its requirements – would have been a more prudent decision. The management team learned a valuable lesson from this experience: cutting costs does not always equate to long-term gains. In order to maintain an efficient workspace and foster business growth, it is crucial to strike a balance between reducing expenditure and investing in the necessary tools and resources required for optimal performance. In this particular case, the consequences of choosing an outdated computer as a means to save money were both time-consuming and costly, ultimately negating any initial advantage gained by the strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Evanescence () is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1995 by singer/pianist Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide and helped the band win two Grammy Awards out of seven nominations. A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold more than one million copies worldwide. On April 27, 2015, it was announced that the band would perform at Japan's Ozzfest on November 21, 2015, as the second headline act, making it the band's first live performance since their hiatus. Prior to Ozzfest, Evanescence would play three shows in the United States. On August 7, 2015, Lee announced that long-time guitarist Terry Balsamo had departed the band. His position was filled by German singer and guitarist Jen Majura, bassist for folk metal band Equilibrium. In an October 2015 interview, Lee stated that the band would continue to tour in 2016, but that when it came to recording new music, she was focusing on recording a solo album rather than a new Evanescence album. In late 2016, the band toured select cities in the United States, choosing alternative rock band Veridia as their opener. On September 13, 2016, the band announced a vinyl box set titled The Ultimate Collection that includes all of their albums (including Origin) and a new version of \\"Even in Death\\", a song which first appeared on Origin. The set was released on December 9, 2016. During an interview with Loudwire, Lee stated \\"there is Evanescence in the future\\" and that there had been work on another pre-Fallen song which would be released later. On February 18, 2017, a compilation album titled Lost Whispers was made available for streaming and downloading on Spotify, iTunes and Anghami. It contained the rerecorded \\"Even in Death\\", previously released B-sides, the four deluxe edition bonus tracks to Evanescence, and the new song \\"Lost Whispers\\". On March 20, 2017, Lee spoke to AOL Build about her solo single, \\"Speak to Me\\"; during the interview, she spoke of \\"a new album\\" in the works by Evanescence, saying \\"We're working on something. [...] It's not just a straightforward 'next Evanescence album',\\" implying a stylistic change. In a March 23 interview with Metal Hammer, Lee stated that \\"It's something unique, something complex, something a little bit beyond that - and it's definitely new territory for all of us.\\" The album was intended for release later in 2017. In a Facebook post, Lee revealed that the new album is titled Synthesis. According to Lee, the album will be an orchestral piece that contains instruments such as brass and other orchestral elements. She also revealed that David Campbell, who worked on all of the band's previous albums, would return to compose for the new project.

It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other. Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind. In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze. Desperately shaking her head \\"no\\", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring. Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely.

Humor has been evaluated by many great minds such as Thomas Hobbes, who, in \\"On Nature\\", disliked humor, \\"Laughter is nothing else but sudden glory arising from sudden thought of feeling far better than others.\\" He thought humor to be a negative quality of human narrow-mindedness. However, Mordechai Gordon, Ph. D of Education, insists, \\"Humor allows us to view the world from an angle that is amusing rather than serious.\\" I agree with Gordon. Learning to look at the world through humor is important. In the United States, every four years an election occurs. Without humor as a way to express their feelings, how else would Americans keep from clawing their eyes out and going the way of lemming? Television shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" have become important parts of American culture. They are mothering the masses by metaphorically airplane-ing politics into our mouths. They make politics fun. Of course, politics is only one type of humor. Social humor helps people through the twists and turns of the human condition. American pop culture promotes an unhealthy self- image. On the topic of self-image, Hari Kondabolu stands out. He has a joke about the popular musical group \\"The Pussycat Dolls\\", describing their hit song \\"Don't Cha\\" as a negative representation of women. He points out an obvious offence in American culture. A study from Loyola University of Maryland has shown that humor is one determining factor for selecting a mating partner. Amongst other things, mates look for an outstanding funny bone in a potential partner. Of course, humor is not always used for good purposes. Humor can be linked to vulgarity and racism, but, like everything else, it has potential to unite human beings by allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our failures and our connection with one another.

Question: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. Manny and Annie were two foodie friends. Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not. Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to analyze the information provided about the two friends and their milk consumption habits. Step 1: Identify the drinking habits of Manny and Annie. - Manny drinks organic milk only. - Annie drinks all types of milk (organic and non-organic). Step 2: Consider the information about antibiotic usage in organic and non-organic milk production. - Antibiotics are not used as a preventative measure in organic milk production. - Fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens are found on organic farms. - Efficacy of antibiotics is higher when required in organic practices. Step 3: Determine which friend is more likely to consume milk from cows treated with antibiotics. - Since Manny only consumes organic milk, it is less likely that he drinks milk from cows treated with antibiotics. - Annie consumes both organic and non-organic milk. Non-organic milk production may involve the use of antibiotics, so there's a higher chance that she drinks milk from cows treated with antibiotics. Answer: Manny, the health-conscious friend who only drinks organic milk, drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics than Annie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","completion":"Given the information in the paragraph, it appears that Low lake had more dissolved nutrients. This is because the paragraph mentions that High lake had very few nutrients due to its layers of stratified water, whereas Low lake was abundant and a prolific fishing spot. Here are the steps for determining this: 1. The paragraph mentions that High lake has layers of stratified water, which means it has layers of water with different properties. 2. The stratification results from the mixing of fresh and salt water, creating separate layers that do not fully mix. 3. Because of this stratification, the nutrients in High lake are less available to the organisms living in the water, making the lake poor in nutrients. 4. In contrast, Low lake is described as abundant and a prolific fishing spot, implying that Low lake has a richer and more diverse ecosystem than High lake. 5. Since a rich and diverse ecosystem is usually supported by more dissolved nutrients in the water, it can be concluded that Low lake has more dissolved nutrients compared to High lake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

With text messaging, social media, and video chatting, technology can allow long distance couples to feel closer to one another, even when they are far apart. There are apps for smartphones that allow you and your partner to touch your thumbs to the same spot on the screen and your phone will emit a vibration. Video chatting services like Skype and FaceTime allow for those in long distance relationships to have face-to-face conversations rather than just talking on the phone. Download a video chatting service and get a webcam! Most new laptops come with web-cameras built in. It's safe to say that most people use text messaging very often in their everyday lives. Use it as a way of sending messages and photos to your significant other while you are apart. It will help you feel more connected and more like you are a part of each other's day-to-day lives. If you go to college far away from one another and decide to maintain a long distance relationship, make sure you are both clear on what you expect from one another. Be open and honest about your needs and where you want the relationship to go. Don't be afraid to tell your significant other if your needs aren't being met, or if you think you both should work towards making some changes. A long distance relationship, particularly one that is made more difficult by the stresses and responsibilities that come along with college life, is an entirely different entity than the average, geographically close relationship. As college students, you are more than likely living on a small budget. With tuition, rent, food, and transportation costs, college is an expensive time in anyone's life. So, budgeting for trips to visit your significant other might seem like a difficult task. Book airline tickets well in advance. A few months to about 8 weeks before is a good window for purchasing. You can even create a price alert on some travel websites and get an e-mail or text alert when plane tickets for your route go down. Try planning a trip to a third location—rather than you going to see them or them coming to see you, plan to meet in the middle, or meet up in some other fun, interesting location. Not only will it keep things interesting, but the effort will feel more balanced on both sides. Consider taking a bus. It isn't as time efficient, but new express bus services in the US can take you pretty long distances for a low fee. Summary:","completion":"Long distance relationships have become significantly easier to maintain with the influx of technology that allows couples to stay connected despite the distance. Text messaging, social media, and video chatting platforms such as Skype and Facetime enable couples to engage in regular face-to-face conversations, allowing them to feel a stronger connection. Additionally, smartphone apps can help create physical connections, such as emitting vibrations when partners touch the same spot on their screens. For college students in long distance relationships, it is crucial to establish clear expectations, communicate openly, and address any unmet needs or required changes. Balancing the demands of college life and maintaining a long distance relationship may pose challenges, but it can be managed effectively. Financial constraints from tuition, rent, food, and transportation can make budgeting for visits difficult, especially for college students. To ease the burden, booking flights well in advance or using online travel websites for best deals can help in cutting costs. Alternatively, couples can plan to meet in a third location or consider taking more budget-friendly modes of transportation, like express buses, for longer visits. By making the effort to stay connected, and planning visits effectively, couples in long distance relationships can overcome challenges and maintain strong connections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this article, we'll explore the key techniques to apply during the glide swing, providing you with insights to help you achieve peak performance. Step 1: Engage Your Abdominal Core at the Peak of the Glide Swing To perform a glide swing effectively, it is essential to activate the abdominal core muscles during the peak of the swing. Scooping your stomach – drawing the navel towards the spine while engaging your lower abdominal muscles – increases your grip strength and decreases the risk of shoulder injury. This subtle internal motion also contributes to more fluid overall movement, resulting in a smooth and powerful swing. Step 2: Lift Your Feet Toward the Bar Once you have engaged your abdominal core, lift your feet towards the bar as you swing. As your legs begin to move upwards, your body will naturally align with the bar. This upward motion not only adds momentum to your swing but also enables you to maintain proper positioning throughout. Step 3: Bring the Tip of Your Toes to the Bar The final step in executing an exceptional glide swing is ensuring that the tips of your toes touch the bar. By maintaining the ideal distance between your toes and the bar, you can avoid over-extension or collapsing, creating a harmonious balance that is crucial to achieving peak performance. As you progress in your practice, you can experiment with different foot positions, such as pointing or flexing your toes, to diversify your skills and optimize your glide swing. Conclusion: Mastering the art of the glide swing requires dedication, practice, and attention to detail. By focusing on scooping your stomach at the peak of the swing, lifting your feet towards the bar, and bringing the tip of your toes to the bar, you can enhance your performance and build a solid foundation for more advanced aerial feats. With a strong core and precise technique, the sky's the limit for your bar and aerial skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we'll follow these steps: Step 1: Understand the relationship between frequency and energy. As stated in the passage, higher-frequency waves have more energy. This means that as the frequency of the waves increases, so does the energy. Conversely, if the frequency decreases, the energy also decreases. Step 2: Apply this relationship to the scenario. Mona is decreasing the frequency of the microwaves she is generating while defrosting her meat. Step 3: Determine the effect of the frequency change on energy generation. Since we know that decreasing the frequency results in a decrease in energy, we can conclude that the amount of energy Mona is generating will decrease.

Given the below context: Although John Foster Dulles, the United States Secretary of State recommended on 24 October for the United Nations Security Council to convene to discuss the situation in Hungary, little immediate action was taken to introduce a resolution, in part because other world events unfolded the day after the peaceful interlude started, when allied collusion started the Suez Crisis. The problem was not that Suez distracted U.S. attention from Hungary but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President Richard Nixon later explained, \\"We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] Nasser\\".The United States response was reliant on the CIA to covertly effect change, with both covert agents and Radio Free Europe. However, their Hungarian operations collapsed rapidly and they could not locate any of the weapon caches hidden across Europe, nor be sure to whom they'd send arms. The agency's main source of information were the newspapers and a State Department employee in Budapest called Geza Katona. By 28 October, on the same night that the new Nagy government came to power, RFE was ramping up its broadcasts—encouraging armed struggle, advising on how to combat tanks and signing off with \\"Freedom or Death!\\"—on the orders of Frank Wisner. When Nagy did come to power, CIA director Allen Dulles advised the White House that Cardinal Mindszenty would be a better leader (due to Nagy's communist past); he had CIA radio broadcasts run propaganda against Nagy, calling him a traitor who'd invited Soviet troops in. Transmissions continued to broadcast armed response while the CIA mistakenly believed that the Hungarian army was switching sides and the rebels were gaining arms.

Q:Information: - Anampses is a genus of wrasses native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans . - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. They are typically small fish, most of them less than long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to . They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera \\"Bodianus\\", \\"Epibulus\\",\\"Cirrhilabrus\\", \\"Oxycheilinus\\", and \\"Paracheilinus\\" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral \\"Heliofungia actiniformis\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party.

The Castro brothers were instrumental in the Cuban Revolution, which brought socialism and communism to the Caribbean nation. Fidel Castro served as both prime minister and president of Cuba, holding various leadership roles from 1959 until he became ill in 2006. His brother, Raul Castro, took over as president after Fidel stepped down, leading the country until his resignation in 2018. Under their rule, Cuba became one of the few remaining communist countries in the world, and the Castro name became synonymous with leadership in Cuba. Miguel Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, was elected as Cuba's new president in 2018, marking the first time in 60 years that a non-Castro family member held the position.

If your porcelain grill grates are really dirty, use a professional grill cleaner for a deep clean. Read the label on professional cleaners to ensure they are safe for use on porcelain grill grates. Most manufacturers will state if they are safe for use on porcelain grates. You can buy a professional grill cleaner online or at your local hardware store. Most grill cleaners come in a spray bottle for easy application. Let the grill cool down or apply the cleaner when it has been shut off overnight. Spray the cleaner all over the grates and let it sit. Then, use a clean grill brush to gently remove any dirt or food debris on the grates. If the grates are really dirty, you may have to do a few passes with the grill brush. If there is a lot of deep grime caked onto the grates, you can also try spraying the grill cleaner and leaving it on overnight. Then, clean it off with the grill brush the following day. Wipe down the grill grates with a clean soft cloth or paper towels. This will ensure there is no excess cleaner on the grill grates so your food doesn’t end up tasting like cleaner when you grill it.

Information: - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores). - Slovenia, officially the Republic of Slovenia (Slovene: , abbr.: \\"RS\\"), is a nation state in southern Central Europe, located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Dragotin Cvetko ( 19 September 1911 -- 2 September 1993 ) was a Slovenian composer and musicologist . - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments. - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. What is the relationship between 'dragotin cvetko' and 'slovene'? Answer:","completion":"Dragotin Cvetko was a Slovenian composer and musicologist. The relationship between Dragotin Cvetko and 'Slovene' is that he was a person from Slovenia, a nation in southern Central Europe where people speak the Slovene language.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Information: - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court. - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation. Representatives are elected to two-year terms with no term limits. The Kentucky House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Frankfort. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky. - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts).

In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year . He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party 's nominee for governor in 1836 . He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature , which acted on only part of it .

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Claim: Those who have more owe more to the state What evidence supports this claim?","completion":"The claim that those who have more owe more to the state is supported by several lines of evidence and philosophical arguments. These can be categorized into the following sub-topics: the progressive taxation system, the relationship between wealth and public goods, the role of wealth redistribution in combating income inequality, and the moral and social responsibility of the wealthy. 1. Progressive Taxation System: The progressive taxation system is a key aspect of modern economic policy that supports the idea that those with more resources should contribute more to the state. A progressive tax system imposes higher tax rates on individuals with higher incomes, as opposed to a flat tax system where everyone pays a fixed percentage regardless of their income level. This is based on the principle of marginal utility, which states that individuals with higher incomes experience diminishing returns on the value they derive from additional income. Therefore, they are better positioned to contribute more to the state without experiencing significant reductions in their well-being. 2. Relationship between wealth and public goods: Another element supporting this claim is the relationship between wealth accumulation and the consumption and provision of public goods. Public goods are services and amenities provided by the government that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and national defense. The wealthy indirectly benefit from these services in various ways, such as an educated and skilled workforce, a healthy population, and secure and well-functioning transportation. In this perspective, those who have accumulated more wealth have reaped the benefits from the public goods provided by the state and therefore have an obligation to contribute more to the state for the continued provision and improvement of these services. 3. Wealth Redistribution and Income Inequality: One of the primary justifications for arguing that those with more resources owe more to the state is to combat the rising levels of income inequality seen in many countries. Wealth redistribution, through mechanisms such as progressive taxation and welfare programs, aims to narrow the income gap between the rich and the poor. Extreme income inequality can lead to social unrest, limit access to essential resources, and hinder economic growth. By compelling those with more wealth to contribute more to the state, governments can use those resources to fund initiatives that support disadvantaged populations and promote economic growth and social stability. 4. Moral and Social Responsibility: The moral and social responsibility argument posits that individuals with greater resources are in a unique position to contribute to the well-being of the broader society. This line of reasoning invokes the idea of \\"noblesse oblige\\" which is the ethic that those with wealth, power, and influence have a responsibility to use their resources not just for their benefit but also to support others who are less fortunate. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that for the continued functioning of a just society, the wealthy should contribute more to the state, which can then use those resources to improve the overall welfare of the community. In conclusion, various lines of evidence support the claim that those who have more owe more to the state. Key support comes from progressive taxation systems, the relationship between wealth accumulation and public goods, the role of wealth redistribution in addressing income inequality, and the moral and social responsibility arguments. Together, these different viewpoints offer a persuasive case for why individuals with greater resources should contribute more to the state for the benefit of the collective well-being of the society."},{"prompt":"Q:What type of details about ulf ekberg can be gathered from the following bio?

Yes, we can conclude that \\"Tommy's subscription would be out in thirty days.\\" In the given statement, we can infer that Tommy is currently a member of a club and has one month left before his subscription expires. When she says \\"in one short month,\\" it implies that there are thirty days remaining (considering the average length of a month).

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\" Answer:","completion":"The full name of Pullen's brother-in-law whose work he hoped \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated\\" is William Burges."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How does the vampire used to make the filmmaker believe Nick die? Aspiring filmmaker Sean is working as a freelance driver to make ends meet. He's assigned to deliver an expensive Mercedes-Benz from Los Angeles all the way to its owner in Miami, which will also allow him to attend the wedding of his sister. He's given strict instructions not to damage the vehicle or pick up any hitchhikers. Sean is driving cross country when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a vampire hunter hunting a group of vampires led by one of the Forsaken--a group of knights who made a pact with the fallen angel Abaddon to live forever. Two of the Forsaken are located in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and infected by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire virus is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism; killing a Forsaken kills his entire bloodline and reverses the condition of anyone infected. Nick believes that if he kills Kit, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a diner, who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight. Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean from turning. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath. Kit catches up to them and lays siege to the gas station. The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the article, the vampire that makes Sean, the filmmaker, believe in Nick's story is Teddy. Nick demonstrates the truth of his claims by killing this vampire, Teddy, through exposure to sunlight. The vampire's death leaves no doubt in Sean's mind that Nick is genuinely hunting vampires and that the threat is real, which leads to their continued journey together in their quest to kill the Forsaken and reverse the vampirism infection in Nick and Sean."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Unfortunately, my experience fell woefully short of my expectations, leaving me feeling both disappointed and disillusioned. Upon entering the venue, I noticed the decor was an odd mix of outdated and uninspired. The chairs and tables, seemingly from a bygone era, were showing signs of wear and neglect. The walls were simple and bland, decorated only with a seemingly random assortment of pictures. Despite the overall cleanliness, the atmosphere lacked any sense of a cohesive theme or design. Service, regrettably, was also a drawback for this place. The staff, although courteous and polite, seemed overwhelmed and poorly trained. Wait times for everything, from ordering to receiving our food, were unreasonably long. This led to noticeable frustration among the diners, as nearby tables voiced similar complaints about delays. Now, I could overlook those shortcomings if the food turned out to be spectacular. Sadly, it was mediocre at best. My order consisted of a widely-touted local dish as my main course, along with a side salad and an appetizer. The salad, while fresh, was reminiscent of something I could purchase pre-made at any grocery store. The appetizer shared a similar fate, with lackluster flavor and unoriginal presentation. The main course, the one thing I was truly looking forward to trying, was simply underwhelming. The dish, with its bland sauce and overcooked meat, lacked the authentic flavors and vibrant tastes I had been promised. As for pricing, I am not one to balk at high prices when the experience justifies such costs. In this case, however, the combination of subpar service, forgettable food, and a drab atmosphere was not worth the premium prices I was charged. It pains me to write such a negative review, especially when I know times are tough for local establishments.

The evidence provided in the premise states: \\"Just east of the intersection, in Saladin Street, is the entrance to the eerie Tombs of the Kings.\\" This statement establishes the location of the Tombs of the Kings within Saladin Street and provides a spatial reference for better comprehension. The Tombs of the Kings, as mentioned in the premise, are the first-century tomb of Queen Helena of Adiabne, who was a convert to Judaism. Her tomb, along with others, was located in this particular area, hence the name \\"Tombs of the Kings.\\" The reason for its eerie reputation might stem from its historical significance, the architectural design of the tombs, and the cultural context related to burial sites. Moreover, the premise contains additional information about the tomb's origins being in Mesopotamia, which gives a better understanding of Queen Helena's background. This factor also helps support the idea that the tomb holds importance due to its link to a historical figure and a significant period in history.

As the global COVID-19 crisis continues to exert considerable pressure on national economies, the European Union's overall budget deficit is expected to rise to alarming levels, threatening the region's economic stability. This unprecedented economic challenge has led to a call for action among EU finance ministers, who are now urging the implementation of budget discipline across member nations as a necessary roadmap to recovery. This call for fiscal prudence and responsibility reflects the concerns that the recent increase in national budget deficits maycause long-lasting damage to the European economy. The ballooning deficits can primarily be attributed to increased government spending on emergency relief packages and monetary support schemes launched amid the pandemic, aimed at keeping businesses afloat and maintaining consumer spending. While these efforts were essential in mitigating immediate economic damage, the increased borrowing required to fund these programs has resulted in the rise of budget deficits. In recognition of these mounting fiscal concerns, the finance ministers of the EU member states have advocated for countries to take a proactive approach in enforcing budget discipline and ensuring that national debts do not spiral out of control. The ministers propose that, as countries gradually emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, they should start adopting a range of cost-cutting measures to decrease expenditures and restore public finances to their pre-pandemic levels. These proposed austerity measures include the reevaluation of social welfare programs, reviewing tax systems, and implementing structural reforms aimed at bolstering long-term economic growth and productivity. In addition, countries are encouraged to further diversify their economies to improve resilience in the face of future financial challenges. While some have argued that imposing austerity measures at a time of crisis may hinder recovery efforts and exacerbate inequality, the EU finance ministers maintain that striking a balance between immediate economic support and long-term fiscal sustainability is of paramount importance. This balance is essential, particularly as the region's economies navigate the dual challenges of recovering from the pandemic's impact and coping with the potential consequences of climate change and the transition to sustainable energy sources. To support this call for budget discipline, the EU finance ministers have also indicated that, in order to protect the collective interests of the region, the European Commission may consider activating the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) once the economic situation improves. The SGP is a set of rules designed to prevent eurozone countries from running high deficits and debts, and its temporary suspension was essential to allow countries the flexibility to respond effectively to the pandemic. In summary, the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have put severe pressure on the European Union's budgetary situation, with deficits on the rise across multiple member countries. In response, EU finance ministers are urging the adoption of budget discipline and austerity measures to ensure long-term economic sustainability, emphasizing the importance of adopting cost-cutting approaches and responsible fiscal policies as a roadmap to recovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most young Japanese people spend a lot of time and work hard at studying English, but Japanese people are not good at English. Here are the reasons: There are few people from English-speaking countries in Japan. They don't have enough chances to speak with them. Japan is an island country and they feel that other countries are far away. So they don't use English very often. And the Japanese feel that it is strange to talk to each other in English. The Japanese education doesn't always follow the educational trends in the world. It puts a lot of importance on grammar and vocabulary, and less on speaking, listening and reading skills. Many Japanese students' English becomes worse after they go to university .They have to learn English again if they work in English-speaking countries.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did the author say he wasn't a big fan of Vegas? Options: A. because he had been there so often B. because he would rather go some place else C. because he found many of its features unsavory D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"C. because he found many of its features unsavory"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trying to snap a five-game losing streak, the Cowboys flew to New Meadowlands Stadium for a Week 10 NFC East rematch with the New York Giants. Dallas trailed in the first quarter as Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes made a 43-yard field goal. The Cowboys answered with quarterback Jon Kitna connecting to rookie wide receiver Dez Bryant on a 13-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT). Dallas added onto their lead in the second quarter with a 22-yard field goal from kicker David Buehler, followed by rookie cornerback Bryan McCann returning an interception 101 yards for a touchdown and Buehler's 23-yard field goal. New York answered with Tynes making a 25-yard field goal. The Cowboys continued its dominating day in the third quarter as Kitna found running back Felix Jones on a 71-yard touchdown pass. The Giants responded with quarterback Eli Manning completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mario Manningham, yet Dallas rebounded with Kitna hooking up with wide receiver Miles Austin on a 24-yard touchdown pass. However, New York continued its persistent play with Manning completing a 35-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kevin Boss. Fortunately, the Cowboys' defense held its ground in the fourth quarter to preserve the victory. The game was delayed in the third quarter for about fifteen minutes when the lights at the New Meadowlands Stadium went out. Since it was already dark outside in New Jersey by that time, it was totally dark in the stadium. Based on the above article, answer a question.

The shortest field goal mentioned is a 22-yard field goal from Cowboys kicker David Buehler. To find the difference in distance between the longest and shortest field goals, subtract the shortest distance from the longest distance: 43 yards (longest field goal) - 22 yards (shortest field goal) = 21 yards So, there is a 21 yards difference between the longest and shortest field goals mentioned in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: [+] forget about the situation; [+] carried out; [+] know the person well; The answer is:","completion":"Quinn's decision to support one's decision during the pleas, pomp, and circumstance shows their commitment and dedication to the situation at hand. Looking at the options provided, it's crucial to dissect each one carefully to determine Quinn's next course of action. Option 1: Forget about the situation Quinn might consider forgetting about the situation after they have shown their support for one's decision. However, this option seems less likely because forgetting about the situation may indicate a lack of genuine interest or dedication to the person involved or the circumstances surrounding the decision. Additionally, Quinn's prior decision to support someone implies they are invested in the outcome of that person's choices. Option 2: Carried out By choosing to continue being involved and ensuring that the decision is carried out, Quinn demonstrates a strong sense of commitment and responsibility. It shows that Quinn is dedicated to the situation and wants to see it through to the conclusion. This option appears to be the most viable for Quinn, as it aligns with their earlier actions and indicates a sincere interest in the person and the outcome of the decision. Option 3: Know the person well Getting to know the person involved in the decision more deeply is another potential course of action for Quinn. This option suggests that Quinn is interested in further strengthening their connection to the person and understanding their motivations, values, and experiences. Pursuing a deeper relationship with the person may help Quinn better support them and provide more informed advice in the future. In conclusion, although all three options present different paths for Quinn, the most likely course of action is for them to ensure that the decision is carried out. This choice reflects Quinn's dedication, responsibility, and genuine interest in the person and the outcome of the decision. Quinn may also opt to get to know the person more intimately, as it aligns with their supportive nature and may further strengthen their connection. However, it is less probable for Quinn to forget about the situation altogether, as it conflicts with their prior actions and support for the individual involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Conacher was born in Toronto, Ontario on May 24, 1900. His middle name was given after the South African city of Pretoria, where British troops were fighting the Boer War at the time of his birth. He was the eldest son of Benjamin and Elizabeth Conacher, and the third of ten children overall. He had four brothers and five sisters. Context: Rugby football was the first sport Conacher played, and it was his favourite. He first played organized football at the age of 12 as a middle wing with the Capitals in the Toronto Rugby Football League. He played four seasons with the team between 1912 and 1915, during which the Capitals won the city championship each year. He won the Ontario championship as a junior with the Toronto Central YMCA in 1918, and in 1919 moved up to the intermediate level. With the intermediate Capitals, he was moved into an offensive role as a halfback. He excelled in the role, and his team reached Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) final. In that final, the Capitals' opponents from Sarnia made stopping Conacher their priority, a strategy that proved the difference as Sarnia won the championship. Conacher moved to the senior level in 1920 with the Toronto Rugby Club where his team again won the ORFU championship, but lost the eastern semifinal to the Toronto Argonauts of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). His play impressed the Argonauts, who signed him for the 1921 season. In his first game with the Argonauts, he scored 23 of the team's 27 points, and led the IRFU in scoring, accounting for 14 touchdowns and 90 of his team's 167 points as they went undefeated in six games. The Argonauts won the eastern championship, and faced the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points in Toronto's 23-0 victory to claim the national title. Named captain in 1922, Conacher led the Argonauts to another undefeated season in IRFU play, finishing with five wins and one tie, as he rushed for about 950 yards. The Argonauts reached the Eastern final, but lost to Queen's University, 12-11. In that game, Conacher was the entire Argonaut offense rushing 35 times for 227 yards but Pep Leadley's 21 yard field goal towards the end of the game gave Queens' its victory. Question: what else was significant in his football career? Answer:","completion":"In addition to his early successes and accomplishments, Lionel Conacher's football career was marked by several other significant achievements. Notably, he was named captain of the Toronto Argonauts in 1922, showcasing his leadership abilities and his teammates' respect for him. Additionally, his exceptional performance in the first east-west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history solidified his reputation as a dominant player in the sport. Conacher rushed for 211 yards and scored 15 points, helping Toronto secure a 23-0 victory over the Edmonton Eskimos (renamed Edmonton 'Elks' in 1922) to claim the national title. Furthermore, his ability to consistently make an impact on the field, as evidenced by his 950 yards rushing in the 1922 IRFU season and his astounding 227-yard performance in the Eastern final against Queen's University, highlights Conacher's remarkable skill and athleticism. Overall, Lionel Conacher's football career was marked by significant personal and team achievements, as well as his strong leadership and impact on the field."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

Premise: hello you sure did to to whom am i speaking Hypothesis: yes that happened, but who's calling? Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"When analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, it is crucial to first understand the meaning behind each statement. The premise says, \\"hello you sure did to to whom am i speaking,\\" which seems to be a mix of a greeting and a question about the identity of the person addressed. Although the original statement may require some interpretation, let's assume it is asking the following: \\"Hello, you did something, and to whom am I speaking?\\" Now, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"yes that happened, but who's calling?\\" This statement assumes that something has happened (referring to an event or action), and then asks who is calling, meaning the identity of the person on the other end of the line. Based on these interpretations, we can attempt to establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis. To do this, we must determine if the hypothesis is necessarily true if the premise is true. The premise focuses on two aspects: the event or action that occurred (the \\"sure did\\" part) and the identity of the person being spoken to. On the other hand, the hypothesis assumes that something happened and demands the identity of the speaker initiating the conversation. While both the premise and hypothesis involve questions related to identities, they slightly differ in their assumptions. The main difference here is that the premise seeks the identity of the person being spoken to, while the hypothesis inquires about the identity of the person making the call. Since these are not entirely equivalent, it is not guaranteed that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. Therefore, the premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis, due to the nuanced difference in context and the focus of the identity questioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No The suggested answer seems to be off from the question it was supposed to respond to. The question is asking \\"when did mass unemployment start?\\", as in looking for a time or period in history when mass unemployment began. Instead of providing that, the suggested answer is discussing the causes and solutions for frictional unemployment, which is only one type of unemployment and not necessarily related to \\"mass unemployment.\\" Frictional unemployment refers to the time period that workers spend in job search or the time that they are between jobs, not to a mass-scale, widespread joblessness scenario. For a more appropriate response, we should note that mass unemployment is generally traced back to economic downturns and crises. The Industrial Revolution saw mass unemployment due to machines replacing workers. Moreover, significant periods of mass unemployment have tended to be during economic depressions and recessions, when layoffs are no longer isolated incidents but affect a vast number of workers in numerous sectors. One prominent example is the Great Depression in the 1930s, where mass unemployment occurred on a global scale due to the severe economic downturn. In summary, it's important for the answer to correctly address the given question by providing specific historical times or periods to show when mass unemployment started, as opposed to discussing frictional unemployment, which only acts as a portion of the unemployment scenario and does not answer the initial question of \\"When did mass unemployment start?\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: My mother’s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family’s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don’t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So … I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn’t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, “No, Jennifer … you sit in the chair.” I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I’ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I’m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I’d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.

An intense search led by the U.S. Navy was launched to find Earhart and her plane, but after several weeks, nothing was found. \\"All right, good night.\\" Those were the last words transmitted 17 days ago from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, somewhere over the South China Sea between Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City. An international search led by the Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines and joined by governments and private companies from the United States, Great Britain, China, Australia, Norway, Japan, New Zealand and others have narrowed down a possible search region to a vast chunk of the Indian Ocean southwest of Perth, Australia. \\"This is probably the one of the largest efforts you'll ever see in terms of maritime surveillance and joint operations,\\" Australian Defense Minister David Johnston said Tuesday. Reports now seem to support the theory, popularized by pilot instructor Chris Goodfellow, that an incapacitating emergency led the pilots to divert the Boeing 777 toward the closest airport (hence turning south) while simultaneously trying to fight an electrical fire of some sort until they were overcome. Experts believe that the jet continued on dumb autopilot until it was, like Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, plunging into the sea. Opinion: Flight 370's resting place is best clue. Earhart was lost on July 2, 1937. MH370 disappeared March 8, 2014, more than two weeks ago. In those 77 years, almost everything about the world has changed. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared just a few years before World War II erupted and a new world order emerged: what is often called the American century. And the three-week search effort for Earhart was entirely American, directed by the Navy. Flight 370 was operated by Malaysia's national airline, en route to Beijing. The flight was the opposite of pioneering, instead a routine long haul of 227 passengers, with a coach class ticket costing about 530. But in this case, the search effort is extraordinary and much more international in scope. This time, it's not just the Americans. The Australians, the Chinese and the Norwegians are deploying their air forces and navies with cutting-edge technologies for weeks on end to help. Pakistani radar, Chinese satellites, even NASA aided the search. Add to that countless hours of analytical personnel. In the end, it was a private British satellite company, Inmarsat, that confirmed the likely flight path and terminus. According to some reports, this is the most expensive search effort in history. Although there was strong criticism against the Malaysian government for delays and missteps during the initial days of the investigation, it seems as if the international community has largely united in focusing massive resources on finding the plane. There was nobody famous on the flight and yet it is somehow unremarkable that dozens of nations are expending millions of dollars to solve the mystery. Together. Pilot: How mechanical problem could have downed Flight 370. All this stands in stark contrast to Russia's opportunistic conquest of the Crimean peninsula, a major part of the neighboring nation of Ukraine. That sort of nationalist land grab reminds me less of the Cold War than of norms of the 18th century and just about every century of history prior. Certainly, there's something extraordinary and dangerous going on in the Crimea, but a calmer, more patient, more historical assessment distinguishes the reflexive nationalism of a weakened ex-empire from the larger trends in a globalizing world. Or what about the civil war in Syria? Or the heightened tensions on the North Korean peninsula? Or the disputes between Japan and Korea over the \\"Sea of Japan\\" versus the \\"East Sea\\"? Or the uprisings in Venezuela? All are hot spots where the international community has largely been paralyzed, unable to do much more than call for multilateral inquiries and issue hollow condemnations. So what's left to be seen is whether this unprecedented international coalition assembled to scour the ocean for the remains of Flight 370 is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise devastating tragedy for the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Or whether this is merely a one-off proposition where each nation is acting in its own self-interest to do what it must for its own citizens, while feigning cooperation for the world stage. I prefer to see the goodness here, that the world can come together and work together when it counts. Sometimes it takes a tragedy to remind us of the everyday miracles of our time.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\". - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that...

Given the question: At some time in your life you may have a strong desire to do something strange or terrible. However, chances are that you don't act on your impulse , but let it pass instead. You know that to take the action is wrong in some way and that other people will not accept your behavior. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the phenomenon of taboo behavior is how it can change over the years within the same society, how certain behavior and attitudes once considered taboo can become perfectly acceptable and natural at another point in time. Topics such as death, for example, were once considered so upsetting and unpleasant that it was a taboo to even talk about them. Now with the publication of important books such as On Death and Dying and Learning to Say Goodbye, people have become more aware of the importance of expressing feelings about death and, as a result, are more willing to talk about this taboo subject. One of the newest taboos in American society is the topic of fat. Unlike many other taboos, fat is a topic that Americans talk about constantly. It's not taboo to talk about fat; it's taboo to be fat. The \\"in\\" look is thin, not fat. In the work world, most companies prefer youthful-looking, trim executives to sell their image as well as their products to the public. The thin look is associated with youth, vigor, and success. The fat person, on the other hand, is thought of as lazy and lacking in energy, self-discipline, and self-respect. In an image-conscious society like the U.S., thin is \\"in\\", fat is \\"out\\". It's not surprising, then, that millions of Americans have become obsessed with staying slim and \\"in shape\\". The pursuit of a youthful physical appearance is not, however, the only reason for America's fascination with diet and exercise. Recent research has shown the critical importance of diet and exercise for personal health. As in most technologically developed nations, the life-style of North Americans has changed dramatically during the course of the last century. Modern machines do all the...

The reason this is my favorite Scrooge is because of EVERYthing. The sets, outdoor locations, costumes are so beautiful and authentic. The music is sweet. The supporting cast is very well done. One of my favorites is the narrator & nephew, played by Roger Rees. His understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of Christmas to me. David Warner is also a totally believable Bob Cratchit. His is a difficult life, but he remains positive and dignified. The best part of course- is George C. Scott as Ebenezer Scrooge. Some have said his portrayal too gruff. I couldn't disagree more. His exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh, weren't out of character. He is a terribly disillusioned man who's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth. During the flashbacks, it's obvious that he isn't all gruff. This is where we see that there is hope for him. If he was totally gone, his partner Marley would never have come for his sake in the first place. And after all, we are none of us past hoping. I think that is a HUGE part of what Dickens was trying to say. When Scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer's with Belle, you see him smile regretfully as he tells Belle in the flashback that he will go through life \\"with a grin on my face.\\" Clive Donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film. Sometimes they get left on the editing room floor.And finally, his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy EVERY time I see it. His apology to his nephew Fred, so sincere, so moving, it is the spirit not only of Christmas, but of humanity itself. The joy he brings to Fred, to his wife are so apparent.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments., what would be the answer ?

Summarize this article: You will need a prescription from within the last year to order contacts, so always ask your eye doctor for a copy after an exam. If you are considering trying to order contacts without an up-to-date prescription, know that online sellers are required to contact your doctor to verify your prescription. If they will, this offers the best of both worlds. You can purchase your contacts from your doctor and often pick them up the same day, while saving the same amount of money you would shopping online. Your eye doctor will usually be able to give you at least a pair of free contacts. Be sure to look online before your appointment, as you can sometimes find coupons online that are redeemable at your eye doctor for an entire box of contacts. Comfort and quality of vision are a main concern when buying contacts, but it is worth asking your eye doctor if there is a comparable, less expensive brand that you can try. Stores like Costco, Walmart, and Sam’s Club have vision centers that can perform exams and sell contacts, often for less than your eye doctor. They also carry many contacts in stock, meaning you won’t have to wait on shipping, as you would for an online provider. Online coupon sites offer up to 70% off on certain brands, and big-box stores and national eye care chains also frequently accept coupons. Vision insurance companies like VSP also regularly offer discounts and rebates on top brands, so be sure to check with your insurance before purchasing contacts. And don’t forget to look for coupons for saline solution. Saving 2 or 3 dollars every time you buy a bottle can really add up by the end of the year. There are many websites that sell contacts for less than your doctor might, particularly if you buy in bulk. But you will want to make sure you are not only saving money, but also buying from a reputable company that can offer customer service or returns, if necessary. You want to be sure that the online seller you choose is capable of shipping your prescription quickly, and of handling returns if necessary. Before ordering, make sure: Customer service is available. This means you can get in contact with a live person if you need help or want to inquire about returns or shipping delays. Try their number before ordering. If you get an answering machine, you are likely dealing with a back-room operation. You know how quickly your order will ship. Smaller companies may take longer to deliver because they only stock the most common prescriptions. They offer returns. If you buy a year’s supply of contacts and your prescription changes or your eye doctor recommends a different brand, you’ll want to be able to return unopened boxes for credit. The ordering process is secure. The URL at the top of your browser should begin with https:// rather than http:// on any page that you enter personal information. The bureau can inform you of any complaints against a company and how they were resolved. There are many online sites that will compare prices from multiple seller, including Google Shopping, BizRate, PriceGrabber, Shopping.com and Yahoo! Shopping. When considering the price, be sure to: Include shipping and handling fees. Try entering large quantities in order to reduce shipping costs, but be sure to check the expiration date. Make sure you will be able to use all of your contacts before they expire. They may cost more than you think, due to exchange rates and possible import duties. Also, you will have fewer consumer rights if something goes wrong.","completion":"When you need new contacts, ask your eye doctor for a prescription.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House.

Does it follow that \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\" is essentially a rephrasing of the original sentence with similar meaning and context, although there are some subtle differences between them. The first sentence, \\"They're making noises, said Slim, in a whisper which was barely audible,\\" conveys that Slim is addressing the fact that some individuals or objects are producing noises, and the way he communicates this information is by whispering it in such a low volume that it is barely audible. This phrasing emphasizes the quietness of Slim's words, and the use of \\"noises\\" implies that the sounds being made may be unexpected or unwanted. On the other hand, the sentence \\"They're making sounds, said Slim very quietly.\\" also communicates that Slim is noticing and pointing out that some individuals or objects are making sounds. In this case, Slim also speaks softly, as indicated by the phrase \\"very quietly.\\" However, this phrasing doesn't draw as much attention to the specific volume of Slim's voice as the original sentence does. Additionally, using the word \\"sounds\\" instead of \\"noises\\" might not deliver the same connotation of the sounds being unwanted or unexpected, as the word \\"sounds\\" can be perceived as more neutral. Both sentences convey that Slim is commenting on some auditory phenomena in a discreet and quiet manner, but the first sentence emphasizes the barely audible nature of his whisper and the possible negative connotation of the sounds, while the second sentence focuses more on the general fact that Slim is speaking quietly. Overall, it does follow that the two sentences have a similar meaning and context, but their phrasing and emphasis on certain aspects provide subtle differences in interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does energy drinks contain bull semen? Options are: a). no b). yes","completion":"b). Yes The two questions are asking the same thing, although they are phrased differently. Both inquire about the presence of bull sperm (or semen) in energy drinks. To provide further context and clarification, I will address the concern raised in these questions. Energy drinks are widely popular and consumed globally, known for providing a temporary boost in energy and alertness. They typically contain a variety of ingredients, such as caffeine, taurine, sugar, vitamins, and other herbal supplements. However, there is a common myth that bull sperm or semen is an ingredient in some energy drinks. The origin of this myth can be traced back to the presence of an amino acid called taurine in energy drinks. Taurine, named after the Latin word 'Taurus' meaning ‘bull,' was first isolated from a bull's bile in 1827 by German scientists. However, the taurine used in energy drinks today is synthesized in laboratories and is not derived from any animal source, including bulls. It is safe for human consumption and is classified as a conditionally essential amino acid, which means that humans can produce taurine internally but may require external sources based on their individual needs or circumstances such as illness or stress. So, while it is true that the questions have the same meaning, the belief that there are bull sperms or bull semen in energy drinks is unfounded. Energy drinks contain artificial or laboratory-synthesized ingredients but do not incorporate any animal-derived substances like bull sperm or semen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Zenzile Miriam Makeba (4 March 1932 - 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, actress, United Nations goodwill ambassador, and civil-rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Context: Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black township of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, was a sangoma, or traditional healer, and a domestic worker. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \\"uzenzile\\", a Xhosa word that means \\"you brought this on yourself\\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \\"Zenzile\\". When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language. The family moved to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, she was forced to find employment; she did domestic work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for white families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career. In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, Bongi Makeba, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with breast cancer, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a hysterectomy. Question: Does she have sublings?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Zenzile Miriam Makeba had siblings. Born to Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, and Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, she had five siblings. Although we don't have specific information about each of her siblings, it is known that her family faced financial difficulties, particularly after the death of her father when she was six years old. This led to Makeba and her siblings having to contribute to the family's income from a young age.

Posted by lastrealindians on May 12, 2014 in Featured ‘Siouxper Drunk’ Shirts Worn at the University of North Dakota’s Springfest, By Ruth Hopkins On Saturday, May 10, 2014, a Sisseton Wahpeton Dakota man posted this picture to my Facebook wall: The photo was taken at the University of North Dakota’s Springfest earlier that same day. In it, non-Native UND students are wearing shirts that say ‘Siouxper Drunk.’ Beneath it, a stereotypical ‘Indian head’ reminiscent of the retired Fighting Sioux logo is pictured drinking from a beer bong. What followed the post were a string of comments from understandably infuriated Natives, many of whom were from the Spirit Lake Nation, the Dakota Tribe located closest to the UND campus. Dakota, Lakota and Nakota people comprise the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires), also known as The Great Sioux Nation. Oceti Sakowin were called ‘Sioux’ by their enemies. The UND Fighting Sioux logo was retired after the NCAA concluded that the race-based mascot was hostile and abusive toward Native Americans. This decision was based on numerous complaints, affidavits, and an abundance of evidence collected over the years that proved the mascot was not only offensive, but detrimental and contrary to NCAA policy. Native mascots personify the widespread systemic racism against Native people that still prevails in the subconscious of western society. The Fighting Sioux-esque ‘Siouxper Drunk’ tees worn at UND’s Springfest by UND students are proof positive that Native mascots are harmful and degrading to Native people, and that retiring all race-based mascots is not only appropriate, but necessary. The ‘drunken Indian’ caricature is one of the worst stereotypes about Native people that there is. Historically, imbibing is not part of Native culture. There are many Native people, Oceti Sakowin included, who do not abuse alcohol. Europeans introduced alcohol to the Indigenous population in America. Prior to their arrival, Native people did not drink alcohol at all. Since then, Europeans have been pretty successful at using alcohol to subdue & assimilate Natives. Alcoholism is a serious issue in Indian country and its nothing to laugh about. According to the CDC, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is the #5 cause of death among Native Americans. In 2010, 15,990 Natives died from alcoholic liver disease alone. Another 25,692 died from alcohol-induced deaths, not counting accidents and homicides. In fact, 1 in 10 Native American deaths are alcohol-related. The tiny town of Whiteclay, Nebraska, located just over the border from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, rakes in millions of dollars for beer companies every year by profiting off the misery of Lakota addicted to alcohol. These people who are sick live short lives full of pain and suffering. Families are destroyed. Now tell me again, how is ‘Siouxper Drunk’ funny? The fact that a whole group of students were able to walk around UND’s Springfest in ‘Siouxper Drunk’ t-shirts without being stopped speaks volumes. Why would faculty, staff, students, and community members choose to ignore such blatant racism? Didn’t anyone have the good sense to feel embarrassed or ashamed of such a discriminatory display? By allowing such open, aggressive hostility against Natives, you are complicit. If you disapprove of such behavior, stand up and be counted. Native students attend UND now, and dozens of Natives have graduated from there. Dakota, Lakota and Nakota Tribal members have degrees from the University of North Dakota. It’s appalling that UND would allow their own students and distinguished alumni to be openly harassed and humiliated on the basis of race by others who attend their institution and are subject to the University disciplinary system. No one can tell me this act was not purposeful. Social media posts reveal that students wearing ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts knew exactly what they were doing. One individual, who’s Twitter handle is @Sioux_Sam, not only posted a picture of himself wearing the offending garment, he previously tweeted about having the shirts made and putting “the beer bong right into the mascot head.” Another UND student apparently had the nerve to hope she would gain notoriety from the act of prejudice against Natives her and her friends perpetrated when they wore ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts. Parents, please let your children know that this is not the kind of behavior one should want to be known for. Being labeled a racist for the rest of your life is nothing to be proud of. University of North Dakota administrators: you cannot afford to remain silent in the face of such arrogant bigotry. This mockery against Native people, this repugnant spectacle of racial intolerance, took place at your Springfest. An apology for allowing ‘Siouxper Drunk’ tees to be worn at your Springfest isn’t good enough. Sensitivity training will not suffice. Racially motivated incidents keep happening on the University of North Dakota campus. Implement a zero tolerance policy for any and all words, actions, and depictions that discriminate against Native Americans. Only by imposing automatic, pre-determined penalties for clearly defined, racially motivated infractions will you finally purge such shameful conduct from your institution. The onus is on you, not the Native Americans who are being subjected to this harassment and abuse. Students who wore ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts at Springfest should be expelled. Native people deserve to be treated like human beings, worthy of respect. We pay taxes. We vote. We are part of this economy and society. We make contributions to our communities, UND, North Dakota, and this country. We will no longer accept being treated as second class citizens. If you aren’t outraged by ‘Siouxper Drunk’ shirts featuring a Native mascot in a headdress drinking from a beer bong, you need to check your moral compass.

The group photo shows ten students in their black, green and white shirts. The shirts say \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" with a logo underneath, similar to the retired Fighting Sioux logo, pictured drinking from a beer bong. Prior to Springfest, someone in the group tweeted \\"Our Springfest shirts will make the news I just know it lol.\\" UND student Frank Sage says many students coming into Indian Student Services on Monday were upset by the incident. Sage says there was no excuse for it. He called it very degrading and demeaning. We are still waiting for comment from UND Administration on whether the students involved in the incident could face any disciplinary action. A blog on \\"Thelastrealindians.com\\" says, \\"The 'Drunken Indian' caricature is one of the worst stereotypes about Native people that there is.\\" Writer Ruth Hopkins goes on to say, \\"Alcoholism is a serious issue in Indian country and it's nothing to laugh about.\\" The blogger cites a CDC statistic that liver disease and cirrhosis is the fifth cause of death among Native Americans and says 1 in 10 Native American deaths are alcohol-related. People on social media are not only bothered by the student's choice to wear the shirts, but are also coming down on CustomInk.com, which is apparently where the shirts were made. CustomInk released the following statement on Monday: \\"We are very sorry about this offensive design. CustomInk's business is focused on bringing people together in positive ways. We handle hundreds of thousands of custom t-shirt designs each year and have people review them to catch problematic content, including anything that's racially or ethnically objectionable, but we missed this one. We apologize for any pain or offense caused by this shirt, and we will continue to improve our review processes to make them better.\\" UND President Robert Kelley released the following statement late Monday afternoon: \\"I was appalled to learn this weekend that a group of individuals had the poor judgment and lack of awareness and understanding to create and then wear T-shirts that perpetuated a derogatory and harmful stereotype of American Indians. The message on the shirts demonstrated an unacceptable lack of sensitivity and a complete lack of respect for American Indians and all members of the community. These T-shirts were not worn at a UND function -- in fact, the event they are associated with is NOT a university event. They don't appear to have been worn on UND property, and we are not aware that the group represents any UND organization. UND has a responsibility to promote respect and civility within the campus community, and we have the responsibility and right to speak out against hateful behavior. As a University, we teach respect for others. It is imperative that, through our actions, we demonstrate respect for all.\\" The UND Fighting Sioux logo was retired after 68 percent of North Dakota voters voted to drop the nickname deemed \\"hostile and abusive\\" by the NCAA. The University of North Dakota cannot select a new nickname until 2015. ||||| The NCAA declared the University of North Dakota's Fighting Sioux mascot \\"hostile and abusive\\" in 2005, and the state voted to remove it in 2012, which leaves the school without a nickname until 2015. Not to worry, though. A group of students has found a solution: Use the same mascot, but add a beer bong to the logo. There's no way this could possibly backfire. \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" T-shirts featuring the beer-bonging Fighting Sioux character debuted over the weekend at Springfest, a popular party not sponsored by UND, leading to several complaints to Indian Student Services Monday morning. One student called the shirts \\"degrading and demeaning.\\" American Indian Student Services Director Leigh Jeanotte told the Grand Forks Herald he doesn't expect the school to take the complaints seriously. \\"Until there is a statement, until there is action, true action, to say that this is wrong, hurtful and it shouldn't be continued, it's going to just keep going on and on and on,\\" he said. The timing of the shirts only added to the controversy. During Time Out Week, a Native American educational event in April, a sorority hung a banner referencing the Fighting Sioux nickname, which also drew several student complaints. The shirts also got the attention of the blog Last Real Indians, which broke down the drunken Indian stereotypes and stats on Native deaths from alcohol that make \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" offensive. The students behind the shirts apparently knew they would bring negative attention, but either didn't care or welcomed it. Last Real Indians posted a screengrab of a deleted tweet from April where a student bragged the shirts would \\"make the news.\\" [H/T ValleyNewsLive, Photo via Last Real Indians] ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In May 2014, students at the University of North Dakota (UND) ignited controversy by wearing t-shirts displaying the phrase \\"Siouxper Drunk\\" and a stereotypical Native American mascot drinking from a beer bong. This incident took place at Springfest, an off-campus event traditionally attended by UND students. This caused outrage amongst indigenous communities because the words and imagery on the t-shirts perpetuated harmful stereotypes about Native people, particularly concerning alcohol abuse. The parody of their mascot was viewed as degrading and offensive. The UND Fighting Sioux logo had previously been retired following a decision by the NCAA that it was hostile and offensive towards Native Americans. Critics, including indigenous students and communities, bloggers, and other individuals, condemned the t-shirts and demanded a better response from the university administration, including the enforcement of a zero tolerance policy for racially offensive behavior and immediate expulsion of the students involved. The company that created the custom t-shirts apologized for its oversight and vowed to improve its review process to prevent such issues in the future. Despite the controversy, the university's response was criticized for being inadequate, prompting further calls for action against such offensive and insensitive behavior."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

The berry , also known as the miracle fruit , was first documented by explorer Chevalier des Marchais , who searched for many different fruits during a 1725 excursion to its native West Africa . Miraculin itself is not sweet . However , after the taste buds are exposed to miraculin ( which binds to sweet receptors on the tongue ) , acidic foods which are ordinarily sour ( such as citrus ) are perceived as sweet . This effect lasts up to an hour . The active substance , isolated by Prof. Kenzo Kurihara ( Kurihara Kenz ) , a Japanese scientist , was named miraculin after the miracle fruit when Kurihara published his work in Science in 1968 . - Reynaud Des Marchais, Chevalier des Marchais was a French cartographer and navigator who travelled extensively in the west coast of Africa, the West Indies and the northwest coast of South America between 1704 and 1727, under service to the King of France. His maps and manuscripts were published posthumously by Père J. B. Labat in Amsterdam in 1730-31. - An oligosaccharide (from the Greek \\"olígos\\", \\"a few\\", and \\"sácchar\\", \\"sugar\\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically two to ten) of simple sugars (monosaccharides). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding. For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response. - Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen through the process of cellular respiration. (Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).) - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo. - Glycosylation (see also chemical glycosylation) is the reaction in which a carbohydrate, i.e. a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). In biology glycosylation mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches glycans to proteins, lipids, or other organic molecules. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells (along with DNA, RNA, and proteins). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and post-translational modification. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins. The majority of proteins synthesized in the rough ER undergo glycosylation. It is an enzyme-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of glycation. Glycosylation is also present in the cytoplasm and nucleus as the O-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation. Five classes of glycans are produced: - Synsepalum dulcificum is a plant known for its berry that, when eaten, causes sour foods (such as lemons and limes) subsequently consumed to taste sweet. This effect is due to miraculin. Common names for this species and its berry include miracle fruit, miracle berry, miraculous berry, sweet berry, and in West Africa, where the species originates, agbayun, taami, asaa, and ledidi. - The lemon (\\"Citrus\\" × \\"limon\\") is a species of small evergreen tree native to Asia. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - Glycoproteins are proteins that contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to polypeptide side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - A sugar substitute is a food additive that provides a sweet taste like that of sugar while containing significantly less food energy. Some sugar substitutes are produced by nature, and others produced synthetically. Those that are not produced by nature are, in general, called artificial sweeteners. - Sugar is the generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources. Simple sugars are called monosaccharides and include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, and galactose. The table or granulated sugar most customarily used as food is sucrose, a disaccharide. (In the body, sucrose hydrolyses into fructose and glucose.) Other disaccharides include maltose and lactose. Longer chains of sugars are called oligosaccharides. Chemically-different substances may also have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugars. Some are used as lower-calorie food substitutes for sugar, described as artificial sweeteners. - Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, preserving sweets or using sulfur dioxide as with wines. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin. - In biology, a common name of a taxon or organism (also known as a vernacular name, English name, colloquial name, trivial name, trivial epithet, country name, popular name, or farmer's name) is a name that is based on the normal language of everyday life; this kind of name is often contrasted with the scientific name for the same organism, which is Latinized. A common name is sometimes frequently used, but that is by no means always the case. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'has part' with 'carbon'.","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'has part' with 'carbon' is 'sugar.' According to the provided information, sugar is described as a generalized name for sweet, short-chain, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food. It is composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. There are various types of sugar derived from different sources, including simple sugars like monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose). Longer chains of sugars are referred to as oligosaccharides. Thus, within the framework of different types of sugars and their compositions, 'carbon' is a fundamental part of the sugar molecule. The presence of carbon is also critical in their core structural framework and functional aspects. The carbohydrate part of the sugar molecule involves carbon atoms linked by covalent bonds, forming a backbone for the other components, hydrogen, and oxygen. Hence, it's the carbon atoms that also gives sugars their basic structural form as well as contributing to their sweet taste, which is a primary attribute and the reason for their extensive use in food. Also, the information provided mentions sugar substitutes, like miraculin, and food additives, which are employed to enhance or replicate the sweet taste of sugar while lowering food energy in some instances. This further highlights the critical role sugars, and thereby carbon, play in the field of food and nutrition. In addition, when it comes to biological processes such as glycosylation, sugar molecules play an essential role. Here, a carbohydrate, i.e., a glycosyl donor, is attached to a hydroxyl or another functional group of another molecule (a glycosyl acceptor). This enzymatic process helps in the production of one of the fundamental biopolymers found in cells, including DNA, RNA, and proteins, where carbon plays an integral role. Thus, given these factors, it is evident that carbon is a part or component of the entity 'sugar', given its role in its structure and function. The 'has part' relationship between sugar and carbon is fundamental to the sugar's physical and chemical properties, its taste, its nutritional value, its role in biological processes, and its use as a sweetening agent in the food industry."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many.

Set in the 1950s, the film begins in medias res near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1 on the piano before being shot from behind a portrait painting of a young woman. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a 40-something British professor of French literature. The film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \\"Lolita\\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \\"Hum's\\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and brassy Charlotte more whiny. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \\"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\\". She has a hysterical outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact. Answer:","completion":"The real name of the person who is being sent to an all-girl sleepaway camp is Dolores, who is also affectionately called \\"Lolita\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to where was the first high school musical filmed??","completion":"The first High School Musical film, titled \\"High School Musical,\\" premiered on January 20, 2006, on the Disney Channel. It was the first installment in the High School Musical franchise and was directed by Kenny Ortega. The film starred Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu, and Monique Coleman. High School Musical was filmed primarily in the state of Utah, United States. The most notable filming location was East High School in Salt Lake City, which served as the movie's central backdrop. East High School is a public high school located at 840 South 1300 East in Salt Lake City. Established in 1913, the school is part of the Salt Lake City School District and has a rich history of its own. The school's expansive campus and picturesque architecture made it an ideal location for the film. Several other scenes were shot at different locations throughout Utah. For instance, the golf course scenes were filmed at the Murray Parkway Golf Course in Murray, a suburb located just south of Salt Lake City. Additionally, the Lava Springs Country Club scenes in High School Musical 2 were filmed at Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club in St. George, Utah. Several interior shots, such as those in the gymnasium, classrooms, and theater, were filmed at East High School. Others were filmed in various parts of Salt Lake City, including local parks, neighborhoods, and other high schools. Some of the film's interior scenes were shot in soundstages at the Salt Lake City Film Center. This allowed the production team to have greater control over lighting and sound, which is essential when filming a musical. The High School Musical series was a significant success for Disney, leading to two sequels — High School Musical 2, and High School Musical 3: Senior Year. Each of the films maintained a connection to Utah, with subsequent installations using the same locations to maintain continuity in the settings of the story. In conclusion, the first High School Musical film was predominantly filmed at East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, with additional scenes shot at various locations throughout the state. The film's setting was a fundamental aspect of its overall appeal and played a considerable role in creating the lively, energetic atmosphere synonymous with the High School Musical franchise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use More Facial Expression One psychologist feels that our facial expression is responsible more than anything else for the impression others have of us. In fact, more than 50 percent of another's impression, he believes, is influenced by the look on your face. Naturally a smile in which the eyes participate is extremely communicative. An unfriendly look often brings the same thing in return. People tend to mirror your expression, so try to show how you feel about a topic or an idea or the audience through your facial expression. 2. Rid Your Inner Fear It's natural to have some tension or nervousness when you appear before an audience. The way to handle it is to put it to work for you, get into action, as Shakespeare observed, action cures fear. There are only a few known ways to control fear. The first is to admit it, do the thing you fear and it will be the death of fear itself. Another simple aid at the last minute before you begin, is to take a few deep breaths, this will help get the butterflies in formation and also keep your voice under control. In fact, if you're thoroughly prepared, just taking a few deep breaths before you're introduced will give you added confidence and balance. Other known ways to control nervousness and fear are to give yourself an encouraging talk or take some physical exercise. 3. Polish Your Voice Our voice is the main instrument we possess for communicating with people, we're all sound sensitive. So invest in a tape recorder, practise your speech by speaking it into the microphone then listen to it. You can even have others join in the evaluation of your strong points and your weaknesses or faults as well. Remember that Demosthenes and Winston Churchill both used pebbles in their mouths while practising their speaking. Simply reading out loud can also help you improve your voice and develop a personal style. 4. Strengthen Your Memory Psychologists tell us that most individuals don't use above ten percent of their natural capacity...

She reveals to Tom that her father is making her house-sit the same night as a party she wants to attend, but Tom convinces her to stand up to her father and attend the party anyway. Lisa asks him to come to their house that night, leading Tom to think that she has invited him to the party; in reality, she just wants him to fill in for her - he reluctantly agrees.

Of those radical Muslims flocking to ISIS' ranks, at least 1,300 are foreigners who have arrived from outside the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq currently under the group's control, according to analysts from the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. News of the surge in numbers comes as France said it would no longer refer to the group as ISIS or the Islamic State, and would instead be calling them by the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. ISIS, which has been condemned as barbaric even by notorious terror group Al Qaeda, rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after declaring the formation of a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video. Growing threat: More than 6,000 new recruits have joined ISIS (pictured) since America started targeting the terrorist group with air strikes last month - at least 1,300 of them foreigners travelling to the Middle East. ISIS' numbers have swelled in the weeks since America launched the first of 167 air strikes against the militant group on August 8. A number of rebel commanders who oppose ISIS but also fight against their enemy Syrian president Bashar Assad have warned that the strikes are increasing local support for the terrorists. As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group. ISIS aims to convince impressionable young Westerners that its brutal interpretation of Islam is how God intended believers to live and that all those who oppose the group can justifiably be murdered. The vast majority of the 1,300 foreign fighters who have signed up to join ISIS in the past month are aged between 15 and 20-years-old and have never been involved in a conflict before, according to Abdurrahman Saleh - a spokesman for the Islam Army, part of the Islamic Front rebel group. ISIS receives approximately 20 new recruits a day in the town of north-west Syrian town al-Bab alone, he told The Times. Many of these jihadists are thought to have easily entered Syria across the porous border with Turkey, having arrived in the latter country on budget airline flights to popular tourist airport Antayla. Change: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the country will no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'instead. Anger: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (right) has denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the shameful actions of the militant group (led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, left) violate Islamic principles. Rebels fighting against president Bashar al-Assad in northwestern Syria are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccination -leading to the deaths of 50 young children. Dozens of infants in the rebel-held cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province died on Tuesday, minutes after being given the drug. Although the cause of death has not yet been established, officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while unguarded in a storage facility in the city of Jarjanaz. The vaccinations are part of a large-scale campaign to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella, and polio in rebel-held areas of northern Syria. They are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area, according to the Boston Globe. In a Skype interview with the newspaper, Dr Abdulla Ajaj - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children. 'This is the first time we have had such a problem,' he added. Mr Ajaj proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature. Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges,' he said. Samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to Turkey for analysis . It is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released. How to refer to ISIS has been a source of much debate in the West - not least because the militant group has continually renamed itself. Formed as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (meaning Group of Monotheism and Jihad) in 1999, the militants changed name to Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (meaning Jihad Base in the Land of Two Rivers) in 2003. As it became better known, Western countries began referring to the group as Al Qaeda in Iraq, also known as AQI. In 2006 the group became part of an umbrella organization called the Mujahideen Shura Council before re-branding as Dawlat al-ʻIraq al-Islāmīyah (the Islamic State of Iraq, or ISI) later the same year. Last year, having expanded into Syria, the group changed its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). An alternative name for the Levant of Greater Syria is 'Sham' which led to the alternative name Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). The derogatory Arabian acronym Daesh - the name France now says it will now refer to ISIS by - is based on the Arabic version of this name: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. Earlier this year the group claimed to have established a caliphate in the Middle East, and dropped all geographic references in its name - simply calling itself the Islamic State. Referring to the group by this name has proven problematic as the group is neither a recognised independent state, nor does it represent the views of the majority of Muslims. A total of 20 new recruits a day equates to 500 jihadists turning up in Al-Bab every month - with Mr Saleh saying there are 'hundreds' of other towns in Syria seeing a similar level of arrival. The group pay wages of up to £600 a month to seasoned fighters from areas like North Africa and Chechnya, and even greater sums to professional workers such as doctors and surgeons, according to Hussam al-Marie, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula yesterday launched an unprecedented plea for its affiliate in Syria, Jabhat Al Nusra, to stop fighting against ISIS and unite against a U.S. led 'alliance of infidelity and evil.' The development came as France said it would no longer refer to ISIS as the Islamic State and would now be using the derogatory title 'Daesh cutthroats'. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius asked journalists and media organisations to comply with the request, arguing 'this is a terrorist group and not a state', and saying any other title unfairly blurs the line between ordinary Muslims and extremists. Terror: As well as aggressive social media-led recruitment campaigns in the Middle East, ISIS has released a number of slick English-language propaganda videos (such as the one pictured above) and digital magazines designed to encourage young Muslims living in Western nations to join the terror group. Spread: Nine imams were among 15 people arrested by masked police (pictured) in Kosovo yesterday. The arrests were allegedly to stop the flow of young Muslims leaving the country to join ISIS. The name Daesh is taken from the loose acronym Arabian nations use to abbreviate their name for the Islamic State: al-Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham. ISIS has condemned the acronym Daesh as insulting and disrespectful because it sounds like the Arabic words 'daes' - which means 'one who crushes something underfoot', and 'dahes' - which means 'one who sows discord'. The word 'dahes' also has negative connotations to turbulent pre-Islamic era of infighting between Arab tribes - a period of history that has come to be known as Dahes wal Ghabra. This morning Iranian President Hassan Rouhani denounced ISIS' beheading of innocent people, saying the militant group's shameful actions violate Islamic principles. 'From the viewpoint of the Islamic tenets and culture, killing ... innocent people equals the killing of the whole humanity,' Rouhani told U.S. television network NBC. 'And therefore, the killing and beheading of innocent people in fact is a matter of shame for them and it's the matter of concern and sorrow for all the human and all the mankind,' he added. The 22-year-old Sydney man arrested in Australia's largest counterterrorism operation allegedly conspired with Australia's most senior Islamist militant to launch a deadly attack on a random passerby, court documents show. According to the documents, police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei - who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East - two days ago. The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'. Omarjan Azari appeared in Sydney's Central Local Court charged with conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. Before it emerged this month that Baryalei had become a senior Islamic State militant, he worked as a bouncer in Sydney's Kings Cross nightclub district and had also played a bit part in the TV series Underbelly. Azari today appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil. He is the only man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in raids earlier today. Police Prosecutor Michael Allnutt told the court that Azari had made a threat during a phone call a few days ago which involved a 'random selection of persons to execute'. Police intercepted a phone call between the arrested Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei (pictured) who worked as a bouncer at a Kings Cross nightclub and played a bit part in an episode of Underbelly. Azari, who has dark hair, a beard and moustache, had displayed 'an unusual level of fanaticism' in the call, which was intercepted by police. Azari's lawyer Steve Boland did not apply for bail but asked Magistrate Richard Bailey if Azari could go back down to the dock during the hearing. Magistrate Bailey agreed and Azari, who had sat in the dock stroking his beard and smiled briefly while talking to Mr Boland, left the courtroom.

However, to give you a detailed and long answer, let us discuss the Circuit de Monaco and the GP2 series in general. The Circuit de Monaco is an iconic street circuit located in Monte Carlo, hosting the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix, a Formula One race. It has been held annually since 1929 and is widely considered to be one of the most challenging and glamorous races in the series. It is part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, which also includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Indianapolis 500. The tight turns, elevation changes, and narrow streets make it a demanding track for both drivers and their teams. In addition to the Monaco Grand Prix, the Circuit de Monaco also hosts the GP2 Series races, supporting events during the Formula One race weekend. The GP2 Series (now known as the FIA Formula 2 Championship) is a prominent racing series where young, talented drivers compete for the opportunity to progress to Formula One. Founded in 2005 as a successor to the Formula 3000 championships, GP2 serves as a training ground for future Formula One drivers. Many successful Formula One drivers, such as Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, and Charles Leclerc, have previously competed in the GP2 series. Given the fame and prestige of the Monaco Grand Prix in the broader racing world, it could be argued that the Circuit de Monaco might be one of the most popular or attractive races in the GP2 Series.

Chicago, is often regarded as the third most populous state in the United States, and is known for its dynamic architectural scene, vibrant arts community, and rich historical background. Nestled within this bustling city lies the Buckingham Fountain. The Buckingham Fountain is situated in the center of Grant Park, a large urban park in the city of Chicago. Also referred to as 'Chicago's front yard', Grant Park is a 319-acre public park located in the Loop community area of the city. It has been the venue for a number of important historical events, including the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and Barack Obama's 2008 election night rally. Designed by Edward H. Bennett, the Buckingham Fountain was commissioned by philanthropist Kate Buckingham, in honor of her brother, Clarence Buckingham. It was inspired by the Latona Fountain at the Palace of Versailles and is one of the world's largest fountains, standing at an impressive 23 feet tall with a basin measuring 280 feet in diameter. The fountain has 134 jets powered by three 600-horsepower pumps that push 14,000 gallons of water through the fountain's system. The Buckingham Fountain is adorned with four pairs of Art Deco-style seahorses that represent the four states surrounding Lake Michigan - Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. The massive lower basin features multiple layers of cascading water, while the central jet propels water to a staggering height of 150 feet. In terms of functionality, the Buckingham Fountain operates from April to October, with hourly 20-minute water shows that take place from 9 am to 10:35 pm. From dusk until the fountain's closing, a spectacular light and music show can be experienced, attracting both locals and tourists alike. Additionally, one of the notable features of the Buckingham Fountain is its sophisticated computer system, which monitors and controls the fountain's lighting, music, and water displays. Hailed as a monumental piece of ornamental art and historic richness in the city of Chicago, the Buckingham Fountain has been featured in various artistic representations, from postcards to films and TV series, including the opening credits of the television series \\"Married with Children.\\" In essence, the Buckingham Fountain is not just a treasured piece of architecture but also an emblem of the city's cultural and historical landscape, reflecting Chicago's artistry and love for public decoration.

Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process of bees creating their hive and producing honey involves foraging for resources. Worker bees fly out of the hive in search of nectar and pollen from flowers. Nectar, a sugary liquid, serves as the main ingredient for honey, while pollen is collected as a protein source for the colony. Meanwhile, the bees also produce wax, which is the main building block of their hive. Young worker bees have special glands that secrete beeswax, which they use to construct honeycomb cells. These cells serve as storage compartments for honey and pollen, as well as a place for bee larvae to grow. In addition, bees collect resin from plants and mix it with their saliva to create propolis, a sticky, glue-like substance. Propolis is used to reinforce the structure of the hive, seal cracks, and maintain stability. This collectively ensures that the hive is a strong, well-protected environment for the colony to thrive. So, the first step in this process is for worker bees to forage for nectar, pollen, and plant resins, which enables them to produce honey, beeswax, and propolis for the construction and maintenance of their hive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad.

Here is an article: During a news conference Thursday, Speaker of the House John Boehner denied the idea that a lack of funding might have played a role in the train derailment that led to the deaths of at least eight people near Philadelphia. (AP) Hours after the Amtrak 188 train derailment, Democrats were hammering Republicans for not investing enough in the nation’s infrastructure. The National Transportation Safety Board has said that if the train had been equipped with positive train control technology, which detects speeding, the accident would not have occurred. Amtrak has installed it on some tracks and trains as mandated by Congress in 2008, but funds are stretched thin and the industry has said it needs more time. On CNN Friday morning, the House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) pushed back hard on a line of questioning about whether the Congress should be held accountable for what happened. “I believe it’s shameless that we have colleagues trying to exploit a tragedy like this for funding,” Shuster said. Later in the interview he added, “This accident had nothing to do with money it had to do with a failure on either the operator’s part or the equipment’s part.” On Thursday, a reporter asked House Speaker John Boehner about whether funding for Amtrak was inadequate. “Are you really going to ask such a stupid question?” Boehner asked. “Listen: You know they [Democrats] started this yesterday. It’s all about funding. It’s all about funding. Well, obviously, it’s not about funding.” And on Wednesday, during an appropriations vote on a transportation spending bill that cut Amtrak funding by about 18 percent, a GOP Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho) accused Democrats of trying to politicize the accident when they offered two amendments to double the passenger rail’s company budget. [Following tragedy, debate over Amtrak funding continues on the Hill] The federal government gives Amtrak a little more than 1 billion a year that just about covers its operating cost losses. The White House and Amtrak have asked for about double that amount for investments in capital projects like upgrades to the very old system and its equipment. Republicans have long argued that the government should get out of the rail subsidizing business and hand the job over to private companies. But at least one former Republican thinks his party is going about the issue all wrong. Former Senate majority leader Trent Lott, a rail enthusiast, told the Loop this week that infrastructure is one area where it’s worth investing. “I think deficit spending is a bad idea but there are places where you shouldn’t spend and should spend,” Lott said in an interview. The accident “is an opportunity to stop and ask questions … I just think it’s a mistake to say I’m against everything.” Colby Itkowitz is a national reporter for In The Loop.

SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) finds a blackmail message demanding the city pay him 100,000 whilst also promising that for each day his demand is refused he will commit a murder; his next victim will be \\"a Catholic priest or a nigger.\\" The chief of police and the mayor (John Vernon) assign the inspector to the case, despite his reputation for violent solutions. While in a local diner, Callahan observes a bank robbery in progress. He goes outside and kills two of the robbers while wounding a third. Callahan then challenges him: I know what youâre thinking: 'Did he fire six shots or only five?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, Iâve lost track myself. But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, youâve got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk? After the robber surrenders, he tells Callahan that he must know if the gun was still loaded. Callahan pulls the trigger with the weapon pointed directly at the robber, and laughs as it is revealed to be empty. Scorpio targets a gay black male, but is interrupted by a police helicopter and escapes. Later that night, Callahan and his rookie partner, Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) pursue a likely suspect, but it turns out to be a false alarm. Following that, Callahan successfully halts a suicide attempt, after which he reveals that the origin of his nickname comes from the fact that he is given every dirty job to do. When Scorpio kills a young black boy from another rooftop, the police believe the killer will next pursue a Catholic priest. Callahan and Gonzalez, wait for Scorpio near a Catholic church, where a rooftop-to-rooftop shootout ensues, with Callahan attempting to snipe Scorpio with a rifle while Scorpio returns fire with a submachine gun.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To answer the first question: \\"What made the Battle of Vimy Ridge important to Canada's identity?\\" Step 1: Research the Battle of Vimy Ridge and its context in Canadian history. The Battle of Vimy Ridge took place from April 9 to April 12, 1917, during World War I. It involved the Canadian Corps, under the command of British General Julian Byng, fighting against the German forces to take control of the strategically important ridge. Step 2: Identify key factors that contributed to the battle's significance for Canada's identity. - A successful military achievement: The Canadian Corps captured the heavily fortified ridge, which had previously been unsuccessful for the British and French forces. This victory made a significant difference in the war and was a notable military accomplishment for Canada. - Cooperation and unity: Canadian troops from different provinces fought together as one unified force. This battle marked the first time that all four Canadian divisions fought together and demonstrated their strength, cooperation, and unity to the world. - Loss and sacrifice: The battle resulted in over 10,000 Canadian casualties, emphasizing the sacrifices made by Canadian soldiers and their families for the greater good. This high number of losses strongly impacted the Canadian population and its perception of the war. Step 3: Explain why these factors made the battle important to Canada's identity. The Battle of Vimy Ridge became a symbol of Canada's coming of age and a source of national pride as it showcased Canadian soldiers' courage, skill, and unity. This accomplishment on the world stage helped Canada gain international recognition and eventually led to greater autonomy within the British Empire. Now, to answer the second question: \\"What is the significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge?\\" Step 1: Understand the context of the question. This question is more general in nature, so it shifts focus from the Canadian perspective to discussing the broader significance of the battle. Step 2: Identify the key factors that made the battle significant in general. - The strategic importance of the ridge due to its height and commanding view of the surrounding area. Control of the ridge was crucial for both the Allies and the German forces. - It solidified General Byng's reputation and demonstrated Canadian military prowess, as they used innovative tactics and technology to achieve their goal. - The battle significantly impacted World War I, contributing to the eventual defeat of the German forces. Step 3: Summarize the significance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The Battle of Vimy Ridge is significant due to its strategic importance, the demonstration of Canadian military effectiveness, and the impact it had on the outcome of World War I. Finally, to address the third question: \\"Would you say that these questions are the same?\\" No, these questions are not the same. The first question specifically focuses on the importance of the Battle of Vimy Ridge to Canada's identity, while the second question asks for the broader significance of the battle. Although both questions explore the importance of the battle, the perspectives and objectives are different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \\"Herb\\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \\"Maisie\\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14. Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by handing her an ice cube and saying, \\"Okay, now do something.\\" It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for 250 a week. By age 24, Gleason was appearing in movies: first for Warner Brothers (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as Navy Blues (1941) with Ann Sheridan and Martha Raye and All Through the Night (1941) with Humphrey Bogart, for Columbia Pictures for the B military comedy Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1942) and finally for Twentieth Century-Fox, where Gleason played Glenn Miller Orchestra bassist Ben Beck in Orchestra Wives (1942). He also had a small part as a soda shop clerk in Larceny, Inc. (1942), with Edward G. Robinson, and a modest part as an actor's agent in the 1942 Betty Grable-Harry James musical Springtime in the Rockies. During World War II, Gleason was initially exempt from military service, since he was a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed at the end of his coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F and rejected for military service. Gleason did not make a strong impression on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson's New 1943 Hellzapoppin. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests. \\"Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s\\", wrote CBS historian Robert Metz, \\"would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy's watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze.\\" Gleason's first significant recognition as an entertainer came on Broadway when he appeared in the hit musical Follow the Girls (1944). While working in films in California, Gleason also worked at former boxer Maxie Rosenbloom's nightclub (Slapsy Maxie's, on Wilshire Boulevard).

Sentence 2: It may not be known who was involved in an accident before its reported. Pick from: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The relationship between the first and second sentences can be better understood by dissecting and analyzing the content of both sentences. In the first sentence, the concept of \\"punishing past corporate sins\\" implies that some form of retribution or consequence is being enforced for previous wrongdoings related to a corporation. Additionally, the sentence compares this form of punishment to the idea of fining everyone who was present when an accident occurred, not at the time it actually happened but when the accident was reported. This analogy highlights the perceived unfairness and pointlessness of such an approach to punishment. The second sentence introduces the notion that it may not be known who was involved in an accident before it is reported. This sentence presents a potential complication in determining responsibility for a given accident or incident. Now, let's examine the options provided to see if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence: (A) Yes: This option suggests that the second sentence directly follows as a logical consequence of the first sentence. However, the first sentence focuses on the concept of punishing past corporate sins and the unfairness of the process, while the second sentence discusses the difficulty of knowing who was involved in an accident before it is reported. Although there is some overlap in the subject matter (i.e., dealing with accidents and their consequences), these two sentences are not necessarily logically connected. (B) It is not possible to tell: This option acknowledges the ambiguity in the relationship between the first and second sentences. While the two sentences share some common elements (e.g., accidents, consequences), they are not explicitly linked in a way that one would entail the other. (C) No: This option states that the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While there is a thematic relationship between the two sentences, the specific subject matter and focus of each sentence are distinct. The first sentence deals with the inherent problems in punishing past corporate sins, while the second sentence addresses the issue of identifying individuals involved in an accident prior to its reporting. These distinct issues suggest that the second sentence is not a direct logical consequence of the first sentence. Based on this analysis, the most appropriate answer would be (B) it is not possible to tell. While there are thematic connections between the two sentences, the lack of a clear, direct logical relationship between the contents of each sentence prevents us from determining whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence without ambiguity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - give - swim - bring - drop - eat Explain why a human would choose \\"bring\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"The question poses a situation regarding a selfish man who liked to take food from potlucks. The subsequent question asks what he didn't do with the food. The options that are presented include \\"give\\", \\"swim\\", \\"bring\\", \\"drop\\", and \\"eat\\". From these options, the answer \\"bring\\" is the most logical and contextually appropriate conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, the character described in the question is referred to as a \\"selfish man\\". Selfishness, by definition, implies a lack of consideration for others and a primary concern with one's personal profit or pleasure. In the specific context of a potluck - an event where each guest contributes a dish that is shared by all attendees - a selfish individual may very well partake in eating the shared dishes but not feel obligate himself to contribute any food himself. Therefore, the act of not bringing food to the potluck aligns with a selfish character trait. Secondly, when considering the other answer choices, it becomes apparent that they are either illogical in the given context or contradict the description of the man in the question. For example, \\"swim\\" has no relevance in the context of food and potlucks. The acts of dropping or eating food don't carry inherent implications of selfishness. A person could very well eat the food at the potluck (as asserted in the question), or accidentally drop it, without being selfish. The option \\"give\\" could theoretically be related to the selfish man's behavior. But since it is not specified who the food would be given to, it could be considered a slightly ambiguous option. Also, \\"bring\\" fits neatly into the potluck scenario, as opposed to just broadly giving food in an unspecified context. Consequently, taking into consideration the character trait of the man and the array of options, a human would choose \\"bring\\" as the most appropriate answer. It aligns with the selfish behavior characterized within the potluck context specified. Therefore, it can be inferred that the selfish man liked to take food from potlucks, but didn't bring any food himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","completion":"A: Manduessedum, a Roman fort, was situated in the province inhabited primarily by Celtic Britons, Belgae, and the third predominant group, the Corieltauvi. Manduessedum, now commonly known as Mancetter, was an ancient Roman fort located in present-day Warwickshire, England. The fort was part of a network of Roman military installations constructed to maintain control over the region and to facilitate trade and communication throughout the province. The province where Manduessedum was established was home to three primary people groups with distinct cultural and social characteristics: 1. Celtic Britons: Also known as Brythons, they were ancestral to the modern British people and were a Celtic-speaking ethnic group who lived in the British Isles, including present-day England, Wales, and southern Scotland. They were considered the native people of the region and had their own unique art, languages, and beliefs. During the Roman occupation of Britain, they contributed to the cultural fusion that created Romano-British society. 2. Belgae: The Belgae were another Celtic-speaking group who had their origins on the European mainland, specifically in present-day Belgium and parts of France. They arrived in Britain during the Iron Age and settled in what is now southern England, particularly in modern-day Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somerset. The Belgae intermingled with the Britons already inhabiting the region, producing a unique Celtic-Belgae culture. Some of the Belgian tribes that inhabited Britain were identified by their distinct names, such as the Atrebates and the Regnenses. 3. Corieltauvi: The Corieltauvi, often referred to as the Coritani, were a British Iron Age tribe who lived in the north of present-day England, mainly in the East-Midlands region, covering areas now known as Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, and part of Nottinghamshire. They were described as a distinct and increasingly influential tribe during the Roman conquest of Britain. The Corieltauvi had their own distinctive coinage and were likely involved in trade with other tribes and the Roman Empire. In summary, Manduessedum was a Roman fort in a province that was inhabited by three major people groups: the Celtic Britons, Belgae, and Corieltauvi. These groups each had their unique languages, cultures, and traditions, and they intermingled and adapted during the period of Roman rule, resulting in a diverse and vibrant Romano-British society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Meghan Keneally, David Mccormack and Associated Press Reporter PUBLISHED: 13:21 EST, 2 April 2013 | UPDATED: 13:45 EST, 2 April 2013 A second Republican senator has spoken out in support of same-sex marriage in less than a month. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, who suffered a severe stroke last year and returned to the chamber in January, said ‘government has no place in the middle’ of two people in love, regardless of gender. Kirk, who previously opposed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, said in a post on his blog on Tuesday that ‘same-sex couples should have the right to civil marriage.’ In the wake of his announcement,","completion":"there was a significant surge of reactions from both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage. Not only did Senator Mark Kirk's declaration make headlines, but it also added momentum to the growing acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. Supporters of same-sex marriage lauded Senator Kirk's announcement as a sign of the changing times and the evolution of the mindset on LGBTQ+ rights. They appreciated his emphasis on the idea that government has no place in interfering with a loving relationship between two consenting adults, be it heterosexual or homosexual, and his acknowledgment that same-sex couples should have the legal right to civil marriage. Senator Kirk's stance on same-sex marriage gained him respect from fellow Republicans as more continued to publicly announce their support for LGBTQ+ rights. This marked an important shift within the Republican party that had, up until that point, largely opposed marriage equality. Senators like Mark Kirk and, earlier, Sen. Rob Portman signaled that the Republican party was beginning to grapple with evolving social values. Opponents of same-sex marriage expressed disappointment in Senator Kirk's announcement. Traditional conservative constituents might have viewed the Senator's statement as a betrayal of conservative family values. They felt the endorsement of same-sex marriage undermined traditional marriage and could potentially harm moral standards in society. Many opponents argued that the government should continue to maintain a firm stance against same-sex marriage and protect what they saw as traditional values. Despite the differing opinions regarding his announcement, Senator Kirk's support for same-sex marriage seemed to encourage other Republicans to reevaluate their position on this issue. The increased visibility and vocal support from influential politicians like Senator Kirk played a critical role in shaping public opinion and, ultimately, the legal landscape for LGBTQ+ rights in America. Same-sex marriage has continued to gain acceptance since that time. Just over a year after Senator Kirk's announcement, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. This historic decision reflected the changing sentiments within American society regarding same-sex marriage and equal rights for all citizens. Senator Mark Kirk's statement in favor of same-sex marriage should be seen as one of many key turning points in the ongoing journey towards marriage equality. It showcased the power of political support in raising awareness about LGBTQ+ rights and equality. It also served as a testament to the complexity of social change and the unpredictability of political landscapes. The subsequent legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States presents hope that this type of progress can continue into the future, not just for LGBTQ+ rights, but for other forms of social justice as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel?, using the article: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling..., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article. However, based on the context, we could assume that the person in question would likely have been the \\"donor\\" himself. As the painting depicts Mary in a church setting and her height represents her embodiment as the church, the most probable situation would be Mary appearing before a donor in prayer, who may have commissioned the artwork as a display of devotion to the Virgin Mary. Given that the article doesn't provide a specific name for the donor, we cannot accurately name the person in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Tom Witzky is a phone lineman living in a working-class neighborhood in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake, who possesses the ability to commune with the dead. At a party one evening, Tom challenges Maggie's sister Lisa, a believer in paranormal activity, to hypnotize him. After putting him under, Lisa plants a post-hypnotic suggestion in Tom urging him to \\"be more open-minded\\". Tom then begins experiencing visions of a violent scuffle involving a girl who he later learns is Samantha Kozac, a 17-year-old that disappeared from the neighborhood six months prior. While Tom and Maggie attend a high school football game, Jake is overheard by his babysitter, Debbie Kozac, as he speaks with Samantha. Debbie gets upset and snatches Jake, running off with him in the night. Meanwhile, Tom senses Jake is in danger and rushes home but finds him gone. Tom then sees strange flashes of red light that eventually leads him to the 'L' station where Debbie is speaking with her mother about Jake. When Tom and Maggie confront her, Debbie angrily questions them about her sister Samantha, explaining that she had an intellectual disability: having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and thus a child's tendency to trust strangers. Tom denies knowing her to Debbie but admits to Maggie that she is the girl in his visions. Tom becomes obsessed with Samantha and begins probing members of the community about her disappearance. This attracts the attention of his landlord Harry Damon, Tom's friend, Frank McCarthy and their respective sons Kurt Damon and Adam McCarthy, who all dismiss Samantha as a runaway teen. During an afternoon walk, Jake and Maggie encounter a funeral where Chicago policemen are saluting in a ceremony; here a policeman named Neil immediately recognizes Jake's unique talent and invites Tom to a private gathering of like-minded people to learn more about what is happening to his son. Maggie withholds her conversation with Neil from Tom and goes to the meeting herself, and Neil tells her the spirit... Answer:","completion":"Discuss the significance of Jake's ability to commune with the dead and its impact on his family and the unfolding events in the movie.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Lieutenant general, lieutenant-general and similar (abbrev Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a three-star military rank (NATO code OF-8) used in many countries. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second in command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general. - Social work is an academic and practice-based professional discipline that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups. It may promote social change, development, cohesion, and empowerment. Underpinned by theories of social sciences and guided by principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility, and respect for diversities, social work engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance well-being. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Battle of Kaniv, or Battle of Kaniów took place during World War I on the night of 1011 May 1918, near Kaniv, Ukraine between Polish and German army troops. The fighting pitted the Polish II Corps in Russia (including Brigade II of the Polish Legions), under general Józef Haller von Hallenburg, against the German Imperial Army (including the 28th Landwehr Brigade), under general Zierhold. Ultimately the Germans were victorious with about half of the Polish forces surrendering and the rest retreating in disarray. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - The Triple Entente (from French \\"entente\\" \\"friendship, understanding, agreement\\") was the understanding linking the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with Japan and Portugal, constituted a powerful counterweight to the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Italy, though Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during World War I, and joined the Entente Powers instead, in the 1915 Treaty of London. - The Order of Polonia Restituta is a Polish state order established 4 February 1921. It is conferred to both military and civilians as well as to foreigners for outstanding achievements in the fields of education, science, sport, culture, art, economics, national defense, social work, civil service, or for furthering good relations between countries. - Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire in English-language sources, was a constitutional union of the Austrian Empire (the Kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council, or \\"Cisleithania\\") and the Kingdom of Hungary (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen or \\"Transleithania\\") that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in World War I. The union was a result of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and came into existence on 30 March 1867. Austria-Hungary consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary), and one autonomous region: the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the CroatianHungarian Settlement (\\"Nagodba\\") in 1868. It was ruled by the House of Habsburg, and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal. Foreign affairs and the military came under joint oversight, but all other governmental faculties were divided between respective states. - The Battle of Raracza was fought between Polish Legionnaires, and Austria-Hungary, from February 15 to 16, 1918, near Raracza in Bukovina, and ended with a Polish victory. - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - Second in Command is a 2006 American action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and directed by Simon Fellows.

It was composed of three parts: the joint army (\\", \\"Common Army\\", recruited from all parts of the country), the Imperial Austrian Landwehr (recruited from Cisleithania), and the Royal Hungarian Honved (recruited from Transleithania). - Cisleithania (also \\"Zisleithanien\\", , , , , , , , , transliterated: \\"Tsysleitàniia\\") was a common yet unofficial denotation of the northern and western part of Austria-Hungary, the Dual Monarchy created in the Compromise of 1867as distinguished from \\"Transleithania\\", i.e. the Hungarian Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen east of (\\"beyond\\") the Leitha River. - Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to AustriaHungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918. - A civil servant or public servant is a person in the public sector employed for a government department or agency. The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the \\"civil service\\" varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom, for instance, only Crown (national government) employees are referred to as civil servants whereas county or city employees are not. - The Polish Legions (Polish \\"Legiony Polskie\\") was a name of the Polish military force (the first active Polish army in generations) established in August 1914 in Galicia soon after World War I erupted between the opposing alliances of the Triple Entente on one side (including the British Empire, the French Republic and the Russian Empire); and the Central Powers on the other side, including the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The Legions became \\"a founding myth for the creation of modern Poland\\" in spite of their considerably short existence; they were replaced by the Polish Auxiliary Corps formation on 20 September 1916, merged with Polish II Corps in Russia on 19 February 1918 for the Battle of Raracza against Austria-Hungary, and disbanded following the military defeat at the Battle of Kaniów in May 1918, against imperial Germany.

Continue the following story. Patricia thrived in the humid climate, but Victoria felt like they were under water, so","completion":"heavy and oppressive was the atmosphere. It was their first week in Brazil, having arrived to immerse themselves in its culture, language, and customs. They were siblings – Patricia, a confident and intrepid traveler, and Victoria, the more introspective and sensitive of the two. Upon arrival in Brazil, Patricia dove headfirst into the new experiences, eager to understand the way of life and languages of the locals. Victoria marveled at her sister's enthusiasm and adaptability to the challenges that come with navigating a foreign land. Nevertheless, she felt a constant uneasiness, as though she were submerged in water, unable to surface and breathe the air she needed. One early morning, at their simple but cozy hotel, Patricia suggested they attend a folklore festival held by the locals to learn more about the Brazilian traditions. Victoria initially hesitated but Patricia, ever the persuasive one, managed to get her to agree. The festival was fantastic – a kaleidoscope of colors, music, and dancing. The air was infused with the irresistible aroma of food, and people from all walks of life, dressed in traditional outfits, demonstrated their customs, plied their crafts, and entertained the audience. Victoria found herself drawn to an old man who was weaving intricate patterns on a loom. The vibrant threads and hypnotic motion of the loom cast a spell on Victoria, momentarily lifting her aquatic melancholy. He noticed her watching and beckoned her over. With a smile, the old man handed her a piece of vividly colored fabric, its texture the finest Victoria had ever touched. As she stroked the delicate material, he explained its origins. It was a centuries-old technique handed down through generations, and the fabric was said to hold magical powers. The elders believed that its weight and texture could offer strength and comfort to those who carried it. Intrigued, Victoria wrapped the fabric around her wrist, feeling a sense of peace suffusing her entire being. She thanked the old man and rejoined Patricia, who was trying her hand at traditional dancing. As they laughed and danced together, Victoria felt lighter, unburdened by the oppressive humidity she had been experiencing. Over the following days, they explored more of Brazil. From the vibrant city of Rio de Janeiro to the lush Amazon rainforest, they relished the sights, sounds, and flavors that the country had to offer. Victoria found solace in the presence of her magical fabric, which seemed to imbue her with a newfound strength and ability to tolerate the humid climate. As they traveled deeper into the country, they encountered a mysterious, secluded village high in the mountains. The residents spoke a dialect they hadn't encountered before – a blend of Portuguese and indigenous languages, which Patricia struggled to understand. But Victoria, with the fabric still around her wrist, found herself able to comprehend the rich tapestry of words, absorbing the stories and legends of the village. It was then that Patricia felt a pang of envy and frustration as she watched her sister fully engage with the locals. But as they stayed, Victoria began to share her newfound gift, translating stories and forging connections between their people and themselves. The sisters shared the joys of discovery and learning, realizing that their contrasting perceptions of the world only made their adventure that much richer. As their time in Brazil came to an end, Patricia and Victoria reflected on their journey. They had grown closer, entered the world of Brazilian folklore, and experienced its mystical elements. But the greatest lesson they took away from this land of inherent magic was an understanding that they each had unique gifts to offer – that the beauty of the world lies not just in traversing its lands, but in embracing the differences that exist both within and beyond themselves. And as they boarded their plane to return home, the fabric around Victoria's wrist reminding her of her transformation, she realized that while the air may have felt heavy in Brazil, the weightlessness of the human spirit would reside within her forever – a testament to the adventure that had shaped them both in ways they would never forget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Jack Rafter, born on February 20, 1875, in Troy, New York, was an American baseball player known for his role as a catcher. Growing up in the vibrant city of Troy, Rafter developed an interest in baseball at a young age, which would later translate into a professional career. Rafter made his debut in the world of baseball on September 24, 1904, which was also the starting point for his short-lived career as his final date in baseball would also fall on the same day. In his sole game in the big leagues, Rafter played as a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, a team that continued to gain prominence in the early 20th century. Although he was a right-handed batter and threw with his right hand, Rafter could not make an impact in that game. With such a brief career, Rafter's statistics would also stay limited – he played in only one game, with three at-bats, and unfortunately, no hits. The year 1904 proved to be both the debut and final year for Jack Rafter in baseball. He spent the rest of his life away from the professional baseball scene, but it's likely that he retained a passion for the sport he was once a part of. Little information is available on Rafter's post-baseball life, but he remained a resident of Troy, New York, where he was born. Nearly four decades after his debut, on January 5, 1943, Jack Rafter passed away in his hometown of Troy. He left behind a legacy as a part of the Pittsburgh Pirates and an interesting story of a man who tasted the world of professional baseball for the briefest moment.

Greg's fellow skier Bob is also competing in the same competitions. They both are exited about it. Hint: Ski cross is a type of skiing competition. Despite its being a timed racing event, it is often considered part of freestyle skiing because it incorporates terrain features traditionally found in freestyle. Ski cross courses have both naturally occurring terrain and artificial features including big-air jumps and high-banked turns.

A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time. From the passage, where may tornadoes come from? A) Hurricanes. B) Great heat. C) Thunderstorms. D) Sandstorms. Answer:","completion":"C) Thunderstorms. Tornadoes originate from powerful and severe thunderstorms. As mentioned in the passage, a tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach up to 300 miles per hour. These violent storms can form in various weather conditions, but they are particularly common during spring and summer months, especially in areas east of the Rocky Mountains. Tornadoes can also happen in conjunction with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Meet the Robinsons Context: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \\"Goob\\" Yagoobian. Because he was always kept awake by Lewis...

Process: - Coal is harvested from a coal mine - The coal is transported either by train or truck to power station - The coal is burned in a furnace - Water is turned into steam in the boiler - The steam is cooled in cooling towers - The steam turns the turbines - The generator makes electricity - The electricity is sent through transformers. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose electricity prices might rise happens, how will it affect more people switch to electric fires. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation indeed has a direct and significant effect on the process of coal harvesting, conversion to electricity, and its application such as in electric fires. First, let's understand what the perturbation hypothesis is implying. It's suggesting a potential increase in electricity prices. The primary impact of such an increase would be a rise in the cost of running electric appliances, in this case, electric fires. Thus, if electricity prices rise, it will directly affect the consumers who use electric fires as their heating solution. Understandably, cost is a significant factor when consumers consider their energy solutions. If electricity becomes costlier, it might discourage people from adopting or continuing to use electric fires. Even with the more environmentally friendly footprint of electricity compared to traditional fossil fuel-based fires, the higher operational cost could influence people to either stick with their existing non-electric fires or switch to other cheaper alternatives. However, the indirect impact could be seen on the coal harvest and electricity generation process as well. If more consumers switch to alternatives, the demand for electricity might decrease over time. A downward shift in demand could lead to a decrease in the amount of coal harvested and electricity produced, thus affecting the entire coal-electricity generation chain. Additionally, over the long term, this might incentivize power companies to search for more efficient, cost-effective methods of producing electricity, potentially stimulating investment in renewable energy sources. In contrast, this shift might also cause difficulties for those in societies whose livelihood depends on coal mining and combustion for electricity generation. The overarching effect would also greatly depend on the elasticity of demand for electricity. If the demand for electricity is inelastic (consumers continue to consume a similar amount despite price changes), the changes could be less extreme. However, if the demand is elastic (consumers are sensitive to price changes), even a small rise in price could prompt people to switch to alternative energy sources, thereby significantly impacting the process. In summary, an increase in electricity prices could potentially discourage more people from switching to electric fires due to the higher operating costs, in turn indirectly influencing the coal harvesting and electricity generation process by potentially decreasing demand unless the demand for electricity is inelastic. These changes could further influence the search for more efficient electricity production methods or have social implications for those dependent on the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All moons are satellites, and many planets have them. Some have many moons. Earth, of course, only has one. It's a special moon, though. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system! In fact, the moon is much smaller than the sun. But it's much closer to Earth, so it looks as big as the sun. The moon is so close that you can see its dark and light spots without a telescope. Men flew and landed on the moon's surface many times by spacecrafts in the 1960s and 1970s. Neil Armstrong was the first human to step on the moon. He walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969. The flights to the moon have helped us learn much about it. Astronauts even brought rocks home with them! There's still a lot to learn about the moon.

Question: What did the honest real estate agent refuse to do to a client? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - lie - deceive - hide from - manipulate - charming Answer:","completion":"The honest real estate agent refused to deceive a client. Real estate agents play a crucial role in helping clients find and purchase properties that meet their needs, and a good agent always puts the client's interests first. While there are undoubtedly dishonest real estate agents out there, an honest and professional one will refuse to deceive clients in any way. Options like lying, manipulating, and hiding information from the client could also be applicable as dishonest acts, but deceiving encompasses all of these actions and best suits the question. An honest agent would never compromise their own integrity or the trust of their clients by providing misleading information, omitting critical details, or manipulating situations to their advantage. Performing deceptive acts can lead to serious consequences, both for the agent and their clients. An agent caught in dishonest practices could face disciplinary actions, the loss of their professional license, or even legal consequences. Furthermore, clients who have been the victim of deception can suffer financial losses, emotional distress, and potentially face difficulties in securing a property they need or want. Additionally, being charming is not a form of dishonesty in and of itself. While it could be used to mask intentions or manipulate others, charm alone does not equate deception. An honest agent who is also charming can utilize their charisma to build natural rapport and trust with clients and genuinely help them find the right property. In conclusion, an honest real estate agent refuses to deceive clients, as it goes against their commitment to integrity, professionalism, and the best interests of their clients. Deception encompasses acts like lying, manipulating, and hiding information, which an honest agent would never resort to. The most suitable answer to the question is, thus, deceiving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Skinny Puppy is noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music, especially in an ambitious period that spanned their Head Trauma (1987-1988), VIVIsectVI (1988), Too Dark Park (1990), and Last Rights (1992) tours. Ogre has been critical of the bands early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that \\"I would do things on stage that would blow-they just wouldn't work\\". Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre once remarked that \\"our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine\\". On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman's noose, Key cutting steel with an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 Presidential Election in the United States, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was decapitated by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to \\"not insult the president\\" while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a \\"rough guideline\\" during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are thought up of spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could \\"range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho\\". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like \\"dating hydrogen peroxide\\", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring. Though Ogre and Key have remained the only constant members of Skinny Puppy's live act since the death of Dwayne Goettel, several other musicians have been hired to accompany the pair since 2004. They include drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer. who were part of this band?","completion":"The main members of Skinny Puppy are cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) and Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie).

Dan didn't have alcohol with him. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which of the two people experienced a lower sensation of warmth? Hint: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.

Which entity is this text about? Oingo Boingo was an American new wave band, best known for their hits \\"Dead Man's Party\\" and \\"Weird Science\\". They are noted for their high energy live concerts, movie soundtrack contributions, and their mixture of genre, which can be described as including ska, pop, rock, and world music. The band was founded in 1972 as The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, a performance art group. The band was led by songwriter/vocalist Danny Elfman, who has since achieved success as a composer for film and television. The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, formed in late 1972 by Richard Elfman, was a musical theater troupe in the tradition of Spike Jones and Frank Zappa, performing an eclectic repertoire ranging from Cab Calloway covers to instrumentals in the style of Balinese gamelan and Russian ballet music. The name was inspired by a fictional secret society on the Amos 'n' Andy TV series called The Mystic Knights of the Sea. Most of the members performed in whiteface and clown makeup, and a typical show contained music ranging from the 1890s to the 1950s, in addition to original material. This version of the band employed as many as 15 musicians at any given time, playing over 30 instruments, including some instruments built by band members. While this Richard Elfman-led incarnation of the group performed live, it did not issue any recordings. As Richard Elfman's interest shifted to filmmaking, he passed leadership of the band to younger brother Danny Elfman, who had recently returned from spending time in Africa playing violin and studying percussion instruments. They gained a following in Los Angeles, and appeared as contestants on The Gong Show in 1976, winning the episode they appeared on with 24 points out of a possible 30. The Gong Show presentation included an accordion, a purple dragon and a gaseous rocket-man. Later in 1976, The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo released a doo-wop styled novelty single about kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst entitled \\"You Got Your Baby Back\\". Both this track and the B-side \\"Ballad of the Caveman\\" were written and sung by Danny Elfman. They were featured in the 1976 Martin Brest film Hot Tomorrows; performing the songs St. James Infirmary and 42nd Street. The band appeared as extras in hallucinatory sequences in the 1977 movie I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. When the group began to move away from its cabaret style towards a more pop/rock format, Richard Elfman made a film based on the band's stage performance, Forbidden Zone, which was released in 1980 and filmed in black and white with a cast mostly made up of band members and friends. In one scene, Danny, as Satan, sings a version of Calloway's \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" with modified lyrics integrated into the plot of the film. In another, Richard sings the 1920s novelty song \\"The Yiddishe Charleston\\". The movie attained cult status and provided a springboard for the film and music careers of Richard and Danny.

Use an old garden hose to mark the perimeter of the area you want to edge. Once it's laid out in the shape and size you want, spray paint the ground around the outside edge of the perimeter.","completion":"1. Gather necessary materials and tools. To install landscape edging, you will need edging material (such as metal, plastic, or stone), landscape stakes, a shovel or edging tool, work gloves, and a mallet or hammer. Justification: Gathering all the necessary materials and tools beforehand ensures that you are well-prepared for the task and can work efficiently without needing to search for items during the process. 2. Prepare the ground. Clear the marked area of any debris, rocks, or roots to ensure a smooth surface for installation. Then, use a shovel or edging tool to dig a shallow trench (about 1-3 inches deep, depending on your edging material) along the painted line. Justification: Preparing the ground ensures that there are no obstructions or uneven areas that might cause difficulties during the installation process. The shallow trench will help to keep the edging material in place. 3. Lay the edging material. Starting at one end of the designated area, carefully place the landscape edging into the trench. Press the edging firmly into the ground to ensure it is secure, and keep it in place with landscaping stakes. Justification: Laying the edging material in the trench and using stakes to secure it will ensure that the installed edging is solid, stable, and will not move out of place over time. 4. Level the edging material. Using a level, check that your edging material is even and at the correct height. Adjust the edging material as necessary by adding or removing soil. Justification: Ensuring the landscape edging is level will provide a visually appealing and professional finish, as well as help it perform its function as a barrier between different sections of your garden. 5. Backfill the trench. Once the edging material is in place and level, fill any gaps between the trench and the edging material with soil. Use a trowel or your hands to gently pack the soil in the trench to ensure a tight fit. Justification: Backfilling the trench will further secure the edging material in place, preventing it from shifting or becoming dislodged over time. 6. Tidy up the work area. Remove any debris, tools, and excess soil from the area where you have installed the landscape edging. If necessary, add additional landscaping features (such as mulch, plants, or gravel) to complete the look. Justification: Cleaning up the workspace ensures that your newly installed edging is safe and free of any debris that could cause trips or falls. Additionally, adding finishing touches can enhance the overall appearance and functionality of your landscaped area. 7. Inspect your work. Take a step back and assess your landscape edging installation to ensure it is straight, level, and securely in place. Justification: Inspecting your work ensures that the landscape edging installation is up to standard and meets your expectations for aesthetics and functionality. It also helps identify any areas that require additional adjustments, ensuring a professional finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Today, people all over the world are moving out of small villages in the country to go and live in big, noisy cities. They are moving from the peaceful hills, mountains, fields, rivers and streams of the countryside to the busy world of streets, buildings, traffic and crowds. This movement from rural areas to urban areas has been going on for over two hundred years. In many countries, the main reason people come to live in towns and cities is work. After one or two large factories have been built in or near a town, people come to find work, and soon an industrial area begins to grow. There is usually _ nearby, too. The families of these workers need schools, hospitals and shops, so many people come to live in the area to provide these services and a city grows. In every major city in the world, there is a business district where the big companies have their main offices. In the United States, this area is usually in the city center downtown. It is here that you can see many huge skyscrapers and office blocks. The people who work here often travel a long way to work each day. Many of them live in the suburbs of the city, far away from the industrial area and the city center. Some suburbs are very pleasant, with nice houses and big gardens. There are usually parks for children to play in and large department stores where you can buy all you need. But what is the future of the big cities? Will they continue to get bigger and bigger?

Sir Robert Eric Mortimer Wheeler (10 September 1890 – 22 July 1976) was a British archaeologist and officer in the British Army. Over the course of his career, he served as Director of both the National Museum of Wales and London Museum, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and the founder and Honorary Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, in addition to writing twenty-four books on archaeological subjects. Born in Glasgow to a middle-class family, Wheeler was raised largely in Yorkshire before relocating to London in his teenage years. After studying classics at University College London (UCL), he began working professionally in archaeology, specialising in the Romano-British period. During World War I he volunteered for service in the Royal Artillery, being stationed on the Western Front, where he rose to the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross. Returning to Britain, he obtained his doctorate from UCL before taking on a position at the National Museum of Wales, first as Keeper of Archaeology and then as Director, during which time he oversaw excavation at the Roman forts of Segontium, Y Gaer, and Isca Augusta with the aid of his first wife, Tessa Wheeler. Influenced by the archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, Wheeler argued that excavation and the recording of stratigraphic context required an increasingly scientific and methodical approach, developing the \\"Wheeler method\\". In 1926, he was appointed Keeper of the London Museum; there, he oversaw a reorganisation of the collection, successfully lobbied for increased funding, and began lecturing at UCL. In 1934, he established the Institute of Archaeology as part of the federal University of London, adopting the position of Honorary Director. In this period, he oversaw excavations of the Roman sites at Lydney Park and Verulamium and the Iron Age hill fort of Maiden Castle.

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose person is in the sun happens, how will it affect person cools quicker. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the given process step-by-step and evaluate the effects of the person being in the sun. Step 1: As the sweat evaporates, the sweat sheds molecules into the air When a person is in the sun, the heat from the sun can cause increased sweating. As a result, there are more sweat molecules on the skin's surface, and thus more molecules can be shed into the air during evaporation. Step 2: The sweat changes into a gas The heat from the sun can make the evaporation process happen at a faster rate compared to when the person is not exposed to direct sunlight. This means that a larger amount of the sweat will change into a gas in a shorter amount of time. Step 3: Heat is drawn from the sweat As the sweat evaporates and changes into a gas, it absorbs heat from the body, which is essential for the cooling process. When the person is in the sun, the skin's surface is exposed to additional heat, which means that more heat will be drawn from the sweat, leading to increased cooling. Step 4: This process draws heat from the body The evaporation of the sweat leads to the extraction of heat from the body, thus helping to cool it down. When the person is in the sun, the cooling effect will be more pronounced due to the increased rate of evaporation and the extra heat being absorbed. Step 5: The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body Given the increased rate of evaporation in sunlight, the remaining sweat on the body will also experience a faster cooling process. In conclusion, the perturbation of the person being in the sun does indeed have a direct effect on the process of evaporation and cooling. Although the initial feeling of heat might be more intense due to the sun's rays, the increased rate of evaporation leads to a faster cooling effect in the long run."},{"prompt":"Given the question: It was their first official date.

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.\\", answer the following question.

They look at stars, planets, moons, comets and galaxies, as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy, in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy. Examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin or evolution of stars, or the formation of galaxies. There are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the Universe as a whole. - Robert Andrews Millikan (March 22, 1868 December 19, 1953) was an American experimental physicist honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923 for the measurement of the elementary electronic charge and for his work on the photoelectric effect. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - George Ellery Hale (June 29, 1868 February 21, 1938) was an American solar astronomer, best known for his discovery of magnetic fields in sunspots, and as the leader or key figure in the planning or construction of several world-leading telescopes; namely, the 40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, 60-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, 100-inch Hooker reflecting telescope at Mount Wilson, and the 200-inch Hale reflecting telescope at Palomar Observatory. - The Association of American Universities (AAU) is an international organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education. It consists of 60 universities in the United States (both public and private) and two universities in Canada. - Amos Gager Throop (; 18111894) was a businessman and politician in Chicago, Illinois during the 1840s and 1850s. Most famously he was known for being a staunch abolitionist prior to the Civil War. In Chicago he lost two campaigns to be that city's mayor in 1852 and 1854. In both elections he was the nominee of the little-known Temperance Party, facing tough opposition from the Democratic Party. At the time of the Great Chicago Fire Amos was the city treasurer. He was instrumental in securing financing from New York to rebuild the wooden frontier town into a city of brick and mortar. Grateful Chicagoans renamed Main Street to Throop Street. Many years later and after moving to California, he was finally elected mayorof Pasadena, California in 1888. - Wallace Leslie William Sargent FRS ( February 15 , 1935 -- October 29 , 2012 ) was a British - born American astronomer and the Ira S. Bowen Professor of Astronomy at California Institute of Technology . - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - A vocational school, sometimes called a trade school or vocational college, is a post-secondary educational institution designed to provide vocational education, or technical skills required to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. Vocational schools are traditionally distinguished from four-year colleges by their focus on job-specific training to students who are typically bound for one of the skilled trades, rather than providing academic training for students pursuing careers in a professional discipline. While many schools have largely adhered to this convention, the purely vocational focus of other trade schools began to shift in the 1990s \\"toward a broader preparation that develops the academic\\" as well as technical skills of their students. Australia. Vocational schools were called \\"technical colleges\\" in Australia, and there were more than 20 schools specializing in vocational educational training (VET). Only four technical colleges remain, and these are now referred to as \\"trade colleges\\". At these colleges, students complete a modified year 12 certificate and commence a school-based apprenticeship in a trade of their choice. There are two trade colleges in Queensland; Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Australian Industry Trade College and one in Adelaide, Vergalargona rico, Technical College, and another in Perth, Australian Trades College. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - Pasadena is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States. As of 2013, the estimated population of Pasadena was 139,731, making it the 183rd-largest city in the United States. Pasadena is the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming only the second city to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, after Los Angeles (April 4, 1850). It is one of the primary cultural centers of the San Gabriel Valley. - Arthur Amos Noyes (September 13, 1866 June 3, 1936) was a U.S. chemist, inventor and educator. He received a PhD. in 1890 at Leipzig under the guidance of Wilhelm Ostwald. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.

She walks into a room in the attic and the door closes and locks behind her. Inside the room, she finds rats in cages, as well as a woman (Sally Brown) in cage. Karl Gunther (Klaus Kinski) appears and says of the caged woman: \\"She can't talk. I cut her tongue off.\\" Karl presses a button and a blade is shoved through the woman's back and sticks out of her chest, killing her. Karl smears some of the dead woman's blood from his finger into an inscribed bullet and loads it into a revolver. He points the gun to his head and the gun clicks. He puts the gun down and says: \\"So be it.\\"Sometime later, Sophie Fisher (Tané) is in her apartment in the building, which is located in \\"a big city\\" somewhere in the USA.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Begin the party - Partake in activities - Bring out the cake - Sing 'Happy Birthday!' - Blow out the candles - Eat the cake - Open the presents - Question: suppose the party thrower wants more entertainment happens, how will it affect more people will be interested in attending. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The addition of more entertainment at a party can certainly have an impact on the number of people who may be interested in attending. Generally, when a party offers various forms of amusement, it becomes more appealing to a wider range of individuals. People tend to be drawn to events where they can expect a diverse and enjoyable experience, and the increased entertainment can make the party more memorable by offering something for everyone. As a result, the additional entertainment could lead to more people being interested in attending. The supposed perturbation, which refers to the changes introduced by adding more entertainment, will have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, where more people become interested in attending the event. This influence can be observed in a few ways: 1. Increased Variety: The expanded range of activities will cater to different tastes and preferences, which can draw a larger crowd. Some participants may be interested in certain types of entertainment, while others may be attracted to different activities. This variety will help to create a more inclusive and inviting environment. 2. Enhanced Ambiance: By offering multiple forms of entertainment, the party's atmosphere will be more lively and dynamic. This enticing environment can help to boost the overall attractiveness of the event, making it more appealing to those who may be considering whether or not to attend. 3. Socializing Opportunities: An increase in potential attendees can also lead to improved networking and socializing possibilities. People attending the party may be more likely to make new connections and engage in conversations, further enriching their overall experience. 4. Word-of-Mouth: Enhanced entertainment can also result in positive word-of-mouth for the event, opening up the possibility for more individuals to become interested in attending. As people share their excitement about the upcoming event, the news of more entertainment can contribute to a larger audience. Overall, the addition of more entertainment to a party can influence a greater amount of people to become interested in attending. The supposed perturbation mentioned in the question can lead to the second effect of more people attending by offering increased variety, enhancing the ambiance, creating socializing opportunities, and generating positive word-of-mouth. Consequently, the answer to the question is that the perturbation will have a \\"more\\" effect on the second outcome mentioned."},{"prompt":"Question: Pick one category for the following text.

It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

I don't like amitab &amp;aamir rejecting Australian honours,that's not the way to show ur feelings","completion":"In order to describe the sentiment of this tweet, it is important to first understand the context and decode the message being conveyed. The tweet appears to be referring to two Indian celebrities, Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, who have reportedly rejected Australian honours, presumably as a way to express their feelings or opinions about a particular issue. The sentiment of this tweet can be categorized as negative with a mix of disappointment, disapproval, and frustration. Let's break it down and analyze each aspect. 1. Disappointment: The author of the tweet mentions that they \\"don't like\\" the actions of Amitabh and Aamir, clearly signaling dissatisfaction with their decision. This indicates that the author may have expected a different response or behavior from the celebrities, and their actions did not meet the author's expectations resulting in a sense of disappointment. 2. Disapproval: By stating that the celebrities' actions are \\"not the way to show your feelings,\\" the author shows disapproval of their methods. The author might believe that there are more effective or appropriate ways to express one's opinions rather than rejecting the honours. This implies that the author is not accepting or endorsing the celebrities' actions and has a different standpoint on the matter of interest. 3. Frustration: The overall tone of the tweet suggests that the author has strong feelings about the situation and is not merely providing a passive observation. The use of \\"I\\" in \\"I don't like\\" emphasizes this personal connection. This frustration might stem from perceiving the actions as counterproductive, unnecessary, or even damaging to Amitabh's and Aamir's image or the image of India itself in the international arena. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can be best described as a negative mixture of disappointment, disapproval, and frustration toward the actions of Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan for rejecting Australian honours as a way to express their feelings. The author appears to disagree with their chosen method and might believe that there are alternative ways to communicate their opinions more effectively or appropriately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - student union - mall - department store - library - town or city I believe the correct choice is \\"mall\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"mall,\\" and here's a detailed explanation as to why: 1. Student union: While a student union may occasionally house bookshops catering to students' needs, these are typically limited to textbooks and reference materials. It wouldn't be the ideal place for a fashion enthusiast to visit after shopping, as it focuses mainly on academic resources rather than a diverse range of books. 2. Mall: A shopping mall is the perfect location for someone interested in both books and fashion, as it caters to diverse retail needs. Malls typically house various clothing stores and at least one or more bookshops, offering a wide assortment of genres and interests. This makes it feasible for individuals to find the latest fashion items and subsequently visit a bookshop within the same vicinity. 3. Department store: Although department stores usually showcase an extensive range of products, they tend not to specialize in books. The book section, if available, might be smaller compared to that of a dedicated bookshop. Therefore, while a department store could be a good place to purchase trendy clothes, it might not necessarily be the best place to find a variety of books. 4. Library: While a library is a fantastic place to browse and borrow books, it's not the right environment for someone looking to purchase the latest fashion. Libraries focus on lending materials rather than selling them, meaning that even if various books are available, the individual won't be able to buy them there. 5. Town or city: Although a town or city might hold several locations where a person can buy both the latest fashion and books, this answer is too broad. Visiting a mall within a town or city would provide a more specific location for both items, as previously explained. In conclusion, a mall is an ideal location for someone who wants to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion. Malls offer diverse retail experiences that accommodate both fashion enthusiasts and book lovers, making it easy to access a variety of different stores within one convenient location."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The overall right side of equation becomes 1415h - 9856. This makes our equation 1327h = 1415h - 9856. Now we can get all terms containing h on one side by subtracting 1415h from both sides. This gives us -88h = -9856. Next, to isolate h, you simply divide each side by -88. Doing so results in h = 9856 / 88. That simplifies to h = 112.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

OPTIONS: * World; * Sports; * Business; * Science/Tech;","completion":"The topic of this news excerpt is: Business. The given excerpt refers to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a major U.S. retailer, planning to reduce its prices in the weeks leading up to Christmas after its previous strategy of avoiding deep discounts backfired during the beginning of the holiday shopping season. Since this piece of information discusses the business strategies, retail sales, and consumer behavior of a significant corporation, it falls under the business category. In today's highly competitive retail environment, businesses like Wal-Mart are constantly looking for ways to attract customers and boost sales, particularly during the holiday shopping season when retailers typically generate a significant portion of their annual revenue. In this case, Wal-Mart had initially decided against offering deep discounts, likely in an effort to maintain profit margins and avoid potential financial losses. However, the company's decision seemed to have had a negative impact on their sales during the crucial early shopping weekend, as customers often expect and seek out significant price reductions during this time of year. This experience thus prompted Wal-Mart to reevaluate its strategy and opt for cutting prices before Christmas to recover from the initial setback and entice holiday shoppers. The topic of this news piece also touches upon consumer behavior patterns during the holiday season, as well as the importance of marketing and promotional strategies for businesses seeking to increase sales and retain or grow their customer base. Understanding and adapting to ever-changing market trends and consumer preferences are crucial aspects of operating a successful business in today's evolving global economy.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"When sediment is picked up by an ocean tide, it directly impacts the process of sediment transportation. The tide, being a form of water, will carry the sediment along its natural route, effectively playing a crucial role in the process. Ocean tides have characteristics that directly influence how sediment is carried. Three primary factors are the velocity, depth, and predictability of the tides. Additionally, specific ocean conditions, such as waves and currents, could further affect sediment transportation. 1. Velocity: The speed of the tide determines how effectively the sediment will be picked up and carried by the water. Faster-moving water has more force and energy, enabling it to lift and transport sediment more easily than slower-moving water. As a result, higher velocity equals more efficient sediment transport. 2. Depth: The depth of the tide is also essential, as it influences how much sediment the water can carry. Shallow tides can only move smaller particles and sediment in limited quantities. Conversely, deeper tides can transport larger quantities and sizes of sediment, as there is more water to distribute the weight and buoyancy. 3. Predictability: Ocean tides follow reasonably predictable patterns due to the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, allowing them to carry sediment in a consistent direction. This predictability results in an overall sediment migration, significantly impacting the deposition and collection areas. As for the supposed perturbation in the sediment transport process, it is directly impacting a step of the process. The tidal action, being a form of water, contributes directly to sediment pickup, transportation, and deposition. Ocean tides alter the way wind or water initially distributed the sediment, changing the sediment transportation routes and determining the final deposition locations. Therefore, the tide's impact on sediment transportation is a direct influence on the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania. Ethnic Albanians speak the Albanian language and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. A large Albanian population lives in the Republic of Macedonia, with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally Muslim (mainly Sunni, with a smaller Shia, Sufi and Bektashi component), and a minority are nominally Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as Skanderbeg, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the Ottoman conquest and others during the Albanian National Awakening seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within Yugoslavia underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too. - Montenegro (or or ; Montenegrin: \\"Crna Gora\\" / , meaning \\"Black Mountain\\") is a sovereign state in Southeastern Europe.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells dividing. So what is the difference between mitosis and meiosis? The primary difference is the differing goals of each process. The goal of mitosis is to produce two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, meaning the new cells have exactly the same DNA as the parent cell. Mitosis happens when you want to grow, for example. You want all your new cells to have the same DNA as the previous cells. The goal of meiosis, however, is to produce sperm or eggs, also known as gametes . The resulting gametes are not genetically identical to the parent cell. Gametes are haploid cells, with only half the DNA present in the diploid parent cell. This is necessary so that when a sperm and an egg combine at fertilization , the resulting zygote has the correct amount of DNA—not twice as much as the parents. The zygote then begins to divide through mitosis. Q: Both mitosis and meiosis result in eukaryotic cells doing what?

It takes the form of a story, usually with dialogue, and ends in a punch line. It is in the punch line that the audience becomes aware that the story contains a second, conflicting meaning. This can be done using a pun or other word play such as irony, a logical incompatibility, nonsense or other means.

Title: Eight Men Out Movie plot: In 1919, the Chicago White Sox are considered the greatest team in baseball and, in fact, one of the greatest ever assembled to that point, behind their greatest star, Joe Jackson. However, the team's owner, Charles Comiskey, is a skinflint with little inclination to reward his players for a spectacular season. When gamblers \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Billy Maharg get wind of the players' discontent, they offer a select group of Sox â including star knuckleball pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who led the majors with a 29-7 win-loss record and has an earned run average of just 1.82 â more money to play badly than they would have earned by winning the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Cicotte's motivation for being involved was because Comiskey refused him a promised 10,000 should he win 30 games for the season. Cicotte was nearing the milestone until Comiskey ordered team manager Kid Gleason to bench him for 2 weeks (missing 5 starts) to rest the 35-year-old veteran's arm for the series. A number of players, including Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, and Lefty Williams, go along with the scheme. Jackson is depicted as being not bright and not entirely sure what is going on. Buck Weaver, meanwhile, is included with the seven others but insists that he wants nothing to do with the fix. When the best-of-nine series begins, Cicotte (pitching in Game 1) deliberately hits Reds leadoff hitter Morrie Rath in the back with his second pitch in a prearranged signal to gangster Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on (Rothstein allegedly financed the fix). Cicotte then pitches poorly and gave up 5 runs in four inningsâfour of them in the 4th, including a triple given up to Reds pitcher Walter \\"Dutch\\" Ruether. He is then relieved by Gleason, though the Sox lose the first game 9â1. Williams also pitched poorly in Game 2, while Gandil, Risberg and Hap Felsch made glaring mistakes on the field.

Movie title: A Perfect World Context: \\"A Perfect World,\\" ostensibly about the escape of convicts Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner) and Terry Pugh (Keith Szarabajka) from a Huntsville prison, quickly focusses on their hostage-taking of an 8-year old boy, Philip Perry (T. J. Lowther). The movie opens with the final scene, Butch lying in a field with a Casper the Friendly Ghost mask lying beside him in the grass, a helicopter hovering, and money blowing in the breeze. Both the man and the mask have a faint smile on their faces. The rest of the movie answers the questions posed by that enigmatic opening image.In a small town somewhere in Texas, the town kids are trick or treating except for one family sitting at the kitchen table talking about Halloween. The mother, Gladys Perry (Jennifer Griffin), explains that their religious beliefs put them on a higher plane where such activities are forbidden. Just then the doorbell rings and some children outside yell \\"trick or treat.\\" Gladys answers the door and explains they don't participate in the holiday because they are Jehovah's Witness.Meanwhile, Larry Billings, a prison guard, returns to the prison to get some paperwork to do at home even as the two prisoners in their cells (Butch and Terry) consult with an elderly inmate regarding where the vents go. Once Butch and Terry break through the vents, and it is clear that an escape is underway, Butch tells Terry that they will separate when they get free and reach the state line because he doesn't like Terry. And Terry agrees with that plan as their hatred for each other coalesces. Butch and Terry get past the guard at the gate in Larry's car with Larry at the wheel. Once they reach town they commandeer Larry's car and search for a new escape car. Terry is sidetracked by Gladys making breakfast. Terry breaks into the kitchen holding a gun and terrorizes her, grabbing her around the neck for a smooch. Young Philip, who has wandered in, gets on Terry's nerves so he slaps the boy, an action that further infuriates Butch and precipitates a struggle between the two....

Please write a short summary for the following article: The West Bank is hilarious But that’s exactly what we discovered during our travels in the West Bank: lots of comedy. In a busy cafe in the capital city, Ramallah, we met a young woman who considered it utterly hilarious that her parents had named her Hurriyah Ziada — Arabic for “extra freedom.” Nearby at Birzeit University, we learned that anthropologist Sharif Kanaana has dedicated his career to collecting and archiving the thousands of Palestinian jokes he’s heard — including one in which various heads of state meet with God and make requests for their people. To each, God says, “Not in your lifetime.” Then Yasser Arafat, the former Palestinian leader, asks for his people’s freedom. God replies, “Not in my lifetime.” We learned from a group of men sharing a bubbling hookah pipe one evening that Palestinians are constantly gauging where they stand on the unofficial ladder of Arab comedy. They figure they’re less funny than Egypt, a place so full of jokesters that during the presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser, a special intelligence unit monitored wisecracks about the government. But they’re sure they’re funnier than Jordan. “Have you heard the one about the Jordanian businessman?” one of them asked. “Every morning before work he puts on his shirt, tie and angry face.” Later, we got to know stand-up comic Adi Khalefa, who claims to be the funniest guy from Nazareth since Jesus. He talks about getting on a plane in Israel and noticing a sign on the bathroom reading “Occupied.” “Not just Palestine is occupied, the bathroom on the airplane is occupied?” he cries, before launching into a faux nationalistic chant: “From the river to the sea, our bathroom will be free!” Finally, we met the stars of “Watan ala Watar,” Arabic for “Homeland on a String,” the first Palestinian political-satire TV show. Despite the fact that the program aired on state-run television, no one was off limits: Palestinian leaders, Israeli negotiators, Osama bin Laden, Barack Obama. One skit featured an Islamist judge in Gaza making eyes at a male courtroom reporter. In another, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced a peace deal with Israel — that is, Mahmoud Abbas the 13th, 500 years in the future. In 2010, a polling organization found that 60 percent of those in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip who’d seen “Watan ala Watar” liked it — a far higher approval rating than either of the Palestinians’ main political parties. We weren’t surprised to find comedy so pervasive and popular in the West Bank. That’s because we’re partial to the benign violation theory, a new explanation of what makes things funny that McGraw, the academic half of our duo, has been developing with Caleb Warren, an assistant professor of marketing at Texas A&M University. According to the theory, humor arises only when something seems wrong or threatening but is simultaneously seen as okay or safe. All kinds of humor appear to fit the benign violation theory: A dirty joke trades on moral or social violations, but it’s going to get a laugh only if the person listening is liberated enough to consider subjects such as sex okay to talk about. Puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense. This theory also explains why we found so much humor in the Palestinian territories: The place is full of violations waiting for some joker to make benign. It’s clear from the history of comedy — from the romantic mix-ups of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” to the violent gags of “Jackass” — that a lot of laughs can be mined from trouble and turmoil. It’s why stories abound of humor taking root in Nazi concentration camps; it’s why hefty tomes have been written on the wealth of anekdoty, or jokes, coined by the Soviet citizenry during the dispiriting years of the U.S.S.R. Mark Twain understood this phenomenon perfectly; he once remarked: “The secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow; there is no humor in Heaven.” But sorrow, trouble and turmoil have done more than just give rise to a lot of comedy in the West Bank; such circumstances have also defined the very essence of Palestinian humor. The jokes we discovered were for the most part dark, sardonic and self-deprecating. These jokes, in other words, are what many people consider “Jewish humor,” the sort of wry self-ridicule folks associate with Woody Allen and Larry David. (Not to mention all the other Jewish jokesters who have long dominated the U.S. comedy scene; a 1979 Time article estimated that while Jews made up just 3 percent of the U.S. population, they constituted 80 percent of all comedians.) When you think about it, it makes perfect sense that Jews and Palestinians would employ similar approaches to comedy. Both cultures are defined by struggle and hardship, so it’s only natural that they at times turn to humor as a psychological salve, a form of self-preservation. They have learned to put themselves down before their enemies have a chance to do so. Is a shared sense of humor enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis once and for all? Surely not — but a few shared laughs is a step in the right direction. Read more from Outlook, friend us on Facebook, and follow us on Twitter.","completion":"Despite the political turmoil and conflict in the West Bank, comedy has emerged as a prominent force among Palestinians. From dark, sardonic humor to self-deprecating jokes, residents have found laughter in the midst of hardships and turmoil. The Palestinian culture of laughter and humor includes names like Hurriyah Ziada, meaning \\"extra freedom\\", and Sharif Kanaana, an anthropologist who has dedicated his career to collecting and archiving Palestinian jokes. Stand-up comics and satire TV shows have also gained popularity in the region, reflecting a shared sense of humor that transcends political differences and hardships. While a shared sense of humor might not be enough to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, it does represent a step towards unity and understanding between the two cultures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: In a speech, Mr Hunt will say a first step is to give people online access to their health records by March 2015. And by April 2018, any crucial health information should be available to staff at the touch of a button. PwC suggests a potential £4.4bn could be put back into the NHS with better use of information and technology. This information technology revolution has been long in the offing. It was Mr Hunt's predecessor Andrew Lansley who first pledged in 2010 to start an information revolution to ensure patients could use the web to report their experiences, rate NHS organisations and access their records so there would be \\"no decision about me, without me\\". A couple of years on and progress has been patchy, with some parts of the NHS offering a big digital presence and others lagging. Previous attempts to transform NHS information technology have run into trouble. Labour's scheme, Connecting for Health, allowed X-rays and scans to be stored and sent electronically. But other parts of the programme - launched in 2002 - became mired in technical problems and contractual wrangling and the national programme has effectively been disbanded and local parts of the health service asked to proceed with upgrading IT systems. In a speech to think tank Policy Exchange, Mr Hunt will say hospitals should plan to make information digitally and securely available by 2014-15. This will means that different professionals involved in one person's care can start to share information safely on their treatment. \\"We need to learn those lessons - and in particular avoid the pitfalls of a hugely complex, centrally specified approach. Only with world-class information systems will the NHS deliver world-class care,\\" he will say. Mr Hunts comments come as a report by PwC suggests a potential £4.4bn could be put back into the NHS by using better use of information and technology. Using electronic prescribing and electronic patient records would also give staff more time to spend with patients. The John Taylor Hospice near Birmingham found that using laptops more than doubled the amount of time clinicians could spend with patients. Labour says the public will struggle to understand why the government is making information technology a priority at a time when NHS spending has been cut. Labour's shadow health minister, Jamie Reed, said: \\"As winter bites, the NHS is facing its toughest time of the year and the government has left it unprepared. \\"Patients are waiting too long in A&E and being treated in under-staffed hospitals - they will not thank him for making this a priority. He should sort out the bread and butter issues first.\\"","completion":"A man named Mr. Hunt wants to help people see their health records online by March 2015. He also wants important health information to be available to doctors and nurses quickly by April 2018. A company called PwC thinks that if the National Health Service (NHS) uses technology better, it could save £4.4 billion. This could make it easier for doctors and nurses to share patient information and spend more time with patients. But some people think there are other more important things the NHS should worry about first."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again. When Mary then goes to Uncle Albert's workshop she meets his new young neighbor, who is the exact image of the Nutcracker Prince and asks to be called N.C.
