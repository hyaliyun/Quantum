Summarize the following: It’s important to loosen up your muscles before you begin to exercise. This can prevent injuries and reduces the risk of cramps while you run. Do a set of walking lunges. Take a large step forward with your right leg so that your left leg is extended far behind you. Lower yourself until your right thigh is parallel to the floor. Make sure your left knee doesn’t touch the ground and that your right knee is above your right ankle! Repeat for the left leg and do ten lunges per leg. Hold on to a sturdy object such as a chair. Stand on one leg and swing your other leg forward and backward. Make sure to go through your full range of motion; this means swinging your leg up as high as is comfortable and then extending it behind your back as high as you can. Repeat for both legs. Don’t swing your leg haphazardly or you may hurt yourself. Try to swing your leg in a smooth, controlled motion. Even though you’ll be exhausted from running, it’s important to stretch so that your muscles don’t cramp up. Do some standing quads. Stand with your legs together. Bring your left foot behind your back to your left hand, keeping your thighs firmly pressed together. Press your foot with your hand, taking care not to overextend your leg. Face a wall and press your palms against the wall at chest-level. Press the ball of your left foot against the wall with your left heel on the ground. Slowly lean towards the wall, taking care not to overextend your foot. Repeat this stretch for your right foot.

Available choices: -- No; -- Yes; A:","completion":"No, that would not be a reasonable answer to the question asked. The given statement, \\"Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years,\\" discusses the lifespan of raccoons, not the number of babies in a typical raccoon litter. A more appropriate answer to the question would be: In a typical raccoon litter, there are usually 2 to 5 babies, also known as kits or cubs. However, litter sizes can occasionally range from 1 to 7 kits, depending on factors such as the mothers' age, health, and environmental conditions. Raccoon mothers give birth to their litters in a den, usually during the spring, after a gestation period of about 63 to 65 days. Baby raccoons are born blind and helpless, with their eyes opening at around 3 weeks of age. They wean at about 8 to 10 weeks, and remain with their mother through the first winter. After that, they gradually become independent and disperse to find their own territories. They reach sexual maturity at approximately 1 year of age for females and 2 years for males."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: At what lake in the area that has been covered by sea water at least seven times do nutrients quickly deteriorate? is inside the article: A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into carbon dioxide and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as..., can you guess it ?

After his wife makes him promise to never seek revenge, he instead becomes a bounty hunter. When he steps in to defend a woman in a saloon, the bad guy and his two friends (who happen to be allied with The Colonel), give him a beating and toss him into the street. A woman with a \\"past\\", named Maggie (Cynthia Watros), takes him in to care for him. He stays in her extra room, but she insists he give up his gun while at her home because she has a daughter. The local sheriff, on Cusacks's payroll, is meanwhile trying to run off some squatters. The Sheriff's gang attempts to intimidate the squatters, but once The Preacher learns of the Sheriff's and The Colonel's dealings, he visits the squatters, who tell him they paid for the land but never got the deed. A few days later the Sheriff's posse burns down a few of the squatter's tents. The Preacher attempts to negotiate peacefully with the Sheriff, and so visits Cusack. Cusack tries to persuade The Preacher to join his mob, which he refuses. The Sheriff then sends a message to The Preacher by having some of his men rough up Maggie. Unarmed still because of his agreement with Maggie, The Preacher catches the gang in the act and overcomes one of the men's guns, scaring the men off. The Preacher gets his gun back from Maggie and sets out to visit the Squatters again, and is met by the Sheriff and some of his gang. The Preacher, now armed, tells the Sheriff that the squatters have a right to stay. Gunfire ensues, and The Preacher shoots the sheriff. The rest of the bad guys run off. The Preacher then pays a visit to Cusack for a final showdown, and obtains the deed for the squatters. As he turns to leave, having satisfied his purpose for the visit, the Colonel tries to shoot him, but The Preacher is faster and kills Cusack. The Preacher returns to Maggie and her daughter.

Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman.

Trying to snap a two-game losing skid, the Bills flew to FedExField for a Week 13 interconference duel with an emotionally charged Washington Redskins. Before the kickoff, the stadium held a memorial service for Sean Taylor, as well as all players across the NFL wearing a #21 sticker on the back of their helmets. Due to the recent poor play of QB J. P. Losman, rookie QB Trent Edwards once again got the start. In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 27-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as Suisham kicked a 28-yard field goal. Afterwards, Buffalo got on the board as LB Angelo Crowell sacked Washington QB Jason Campbell in his own endzone for a safety. The Redskins would end the half with Suisham getting a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills started to reply as kicker Rian Lindell got a 38-yard field goal, yet Washington replied with RB Clinton Portis getting a 3-yard TD run. Buffalo would close out the period with Lindell kicking a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Buffalo drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, followed by a 33-yard field goal. On the Bills final drive, Lindell managed to set up for a 51-yard field goal. The first try was good, but Redskins Head Coach Joe Gibbs called time out. After the first time out, Gibbs tried to call a second time out, which led to them getting called for unsportsmanlike conduct and the Bills moved 15 yards closer to the end zone, which reduced Lindell's field goal to 36 yards. In the end, Lindell managed to nail the game-winning 36-yard field goal, squeaking a last second win in the dying seconds of the game.

Answer: At the same time, David H. Price's work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choose from: A). yes. B). no.","completion":"A) Yes. According to David H. Price, several anthropologists have been dismissed from their jobs due to alleged communist sympathies during the Cold War period. Price, an anthropologist and historian himself, has extensively researched and written on the intricate relationship between anthropology and politics, particularly focusing on how anthropologists have been targeted and marginalised for their political beliefs. There are multiple factors as to why some anthropologists faced dismissal from their jobs during this period: 1. Political climate: The Cold War era was marked by heightened political tensions and rhetoric between the United States and Soviet Union. The fear of communism infiltrating American society prompted a state of paranoia known as the 'Red Scare'. As a result, individuals with leftist or communist affiliations, or even perceived sympathies, were often subject to surveillance, harassment, and even professional consequences. 2. Academic affiliations: Anthropologists, given their research involving diverse cultures and societies, often came into contact with individuals and groups promoting alternative social and political ideologies. In the context of the Cold War, these encounters may have resulted in false assumptions or allegations of collusion with communist entities, placing their careers in jeopardy. 3. Susceptibility to political pressure: Universities and other research institutions, as primary employers of anthropologists, were vulnerable to political pressure from the government and other external organizations. In order to preserve their reputation and funding, such institutions may have been inclined to dismiss faculty members accused of communist sympathies, irrespective of the authenticity of such claims. 4. Professional and personal rivalries: The general environment of suspicion and distrust during the Cold War period provided a fertile ground for professional jealousy and personal vendettas to flourish. Accusing a rival anthropologist of communist affiliations could be a convenient way of damaging their reputation and career prospects, potentially leading to dismissal. 5. Ethical concerns: Anthropologists generally strive to provide an unbiased and holistic understanding of human societies and cultures. However, the perceived alignment with a particular political ideology, in this case communism, might have raised concerns about the ethical integrity of the anthropologist and the objectivity of their research. Consequently, institutions might have chosen to dissociate from such individuals to maintain credibility. In conclusion, David H. Price's work highlights the influence of political, institutional, and personal factors on the dismissal of anthropologists from their jobs due to alleged communist sympathies during the Cold War era. The situation reflects the precarious balance between academic freedom, political ideologies, and the quest for knowledge in the field of anthropology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In an attempt to discredit Gene, Doris, who runs a radio station above Sing Low's cafe, broadcasts him on a program sponsored by the oil company.

George Wilkins, who is in charge of the oil well drilling, takes Doris to the drilling site and tell her the well is dry and he needs additional funds from her father to bring the well in. Doris doesn't know that Wilkins is actually trying to swindle her father by getting him to pay for all of the equipment while he stalls the drilling. Wilkins intends to take over the lease on the profitable land when the bank's lease runs out. While taking the payroll to the drilling site, Wilkins and Doris are held up by two thieves, who are actually Wilkins' henchmen.

Question: suppose there are more crystals that form happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If there are more crystals that form, this could potentially lead to a greater amount of igneous rock forming. This is because the cooling and crystallization process is an essential part of the transformation of magma into igneous rocks. The second effect mentioned is the breakdown of igneous rocks into sediment, which later becomes sedimentary rocks. An increase in the amount of igneous rocks formed due to more crystals forming could lead to more sediment being produced as these rocks break down. This, in turn, could lead to an increased formation of sedimentary rocks.

KAPITOLA 18 Doba před svítáním v uličkách karavanní stanice nebyla tak smolně černá jako noc v horách. Translate to English","completion":"CHAPTER 18 The time before dawn in the alleys of the caravanserai was not as pitch black as the night in the mountains. In this chapter, the scene depicted is set during the pre-dawn hours at a caravanserai, which is a roadside inn or resting place for travelers typically found in the countries of the Middle East and Central Asia. As the translation suggests, the darkness experienced at the caravanserai is relatively less than that of the mountains during the nighttime. The caravanserais were vital during ancient trade routes, especially along the Silk Road, as they served as places for travelers to rest, eat, and seek shelter, often within the safety of a walled enclosure. They were essential for facilitating commerce between countries and played a significant role in cultural and knowledge exchange between various regions. The distinction made between the darkness of night in the mountains and the pre-dawn hours at the caravanserai signifies the contrast between the isolated and dangerous conditions of the mountainous wilderness and the relative safety provided by the caravanserai. The mountains at night symbolize the uncertainty, risk, and isolation that travelers face during their journeys. Conversely, the caravanserai represents a beacon of safety and refuge where travelers, merchants, and traders can find rest before continuing their difficult journey. The pre-dawn moment provides a sense of anticipation and renewal, as the night's darkness is about to fade and the new day is beginning. By setting the scene during the early hours before dawn, the author emphasizes the transition between the darkness and the light, a theme that can be metaphorically linked to the unfolding story and its characters' experiences. The pre-dawn hours are a liminal space, much like the caravanserai itself, where travelers are between destinations, caught in a moment that is neither completely dark nor entirely light. This interstitial space can serve as a backdrop for exploring themes such as change, transformation, and the potential for new beginnings. In summary, this line from Chapter 18 describes a scene occurring just before sunrise at a caravanserai, where the darkness is not as intense as the impenetrable blackness of night in the mountains. The passage metaphorically highlights the contrast between danger and safety, isolation and community, and the transitions that occur in liminal spaces. The caravanserai, as a refuge for weary travelers, underscores the importance of such establishments in facilitating trade and cultural exchange in ancient times and contributes to the larger themes present in the narrative."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Papal conclave of October 1978 was triggered by the death, after only thirty-three days in office, of Pope John Paul I on 28 September. When the cardinals elected John Paul I on 26 August, they expected he would reign for at least a decade. Instead they found themselves having to elect his successor within six weeks. The conclave to elect John Paul I's successor began on 14 October, and ended two days later, on 16 October, after eight ballots. The cardinals elected Cardinal Karol Wojtya, then Archbishop of Kraków, as the new pope. Resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, he accepted his election and took the pontifical name of \\"John Paul II\\". - Karol : A Man Who Became Pope ( pl : Karol - Czowiek , który zosta Papieem , it : Karol , un uomo diventato Papa ) is a 2005 TV miniseries directed by Giacomo Battiato , and created as a Polish - Italian - French - German and Canadian joint cooperation project . Karol is a biography of Karol Wojtya , later known as Pope John Paul II , beginning in 1939 when Karol was only 19 years old and ending at the Papal conclave , October 1978 that made him Pope . The TV miniseries was supposed to première at the very beginning of April 2005 in the Vatican , but it was delayed due to the Pope 's death . It was broadcast for the first time by the Italian television station Canale 5 on the first day of the 2005 papal election . Although it was originally broadcast on television , it was also released in theaters , which allowed the film to be shown in Poland . The incredible success of the movie prompted the creation of a sequel , Karol : The Pope , The Man ( 2006 ) , which portrayed Karol 's life as Pope from his papal inauguration to his death . - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope John Paul I, born Albino Luciani (17 October 191228 September 1978), served as Pope from 26 August 1978 to his sudden death 33 days later. His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent Year of Three Popes, the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, ending a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523. He was declared a Servant of God by his successor, Pope John Paul II, on 23 November 2003, the first step on the road to sainthood. - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope. The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church. The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years, and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

Lawrence was in the military while Joseph was not, because","completion":"of a medical condition that exempted him from service. They had been friends since their childhood, sharing a bond that only grew stronger with time. Lawrence had always been the more adventurous one of the two, while Joseph preferred calm, intellectual pursuits. When Lawrence enlisted in the military, Joseph supported his decision wholeheartedly, knowing that his friend's dedication to protecting their nation was genuine. However, their differing paths only seemed to deepen the connection between them. Joseph often envied the tales of camaraderie and brotherhood shared with Lawrence upon his return from military duties. During the deployment, they would exchange letters, and Lawrence often regaled Joseph with colorful accounts of his comrades, the missions, and the military life in general. Joseph, in turn, took solace in his academic pursuits and would share intricate details about the subjects he was passionate about. From politics and astronomy to science fiction novels, they maintained a strong bond and enjoyed their intellectual exchanges. Years passed, and it was Lawrence's final tour of duty before his honorable discharge from the military. Word spread of a dangerous mission his unit was about to embark upon—one that had high stakes and an unprecedented level of risk. Joseph was understandably anxious, fearing for his friend's safety. He expressed his concerns in the letters, to which Lawrence reassured him that his training and the support of his fellow soldiers would be enough to see them through any adversity they may face. The day of the mission arrived. Unbeknownst to Lawrence, Joseph had not slept a wink, keeping a vigil for his friend's safety. Meanwhile, Lawrence's unit carried out their operation under the cover of darkness, relying on stealth and precision to achieve their objective. Unfortunately, unforeseen complications arose, and the mission went awry. Upon receiving news of the failed mission, Joseph's world was shattered. His worst fears had come to pass; Lawrence was listed among the missing in action. The days turned into weeks, and despite the military's continuous search and rescue efforts, they could not locate any trace of Lawrence. Joseph struggled to move forward in the absence of his friend, his heart filled with a blend of sorrow and anger. Determined to honor Lawrence's memory, Joseph dedicated himself to researching and applying advancements in military technology, hoping that his work could prevent such a tragedy from befalling someone else's beloved friend or family member. Through years of diligent study and collaboration with experts in the field, Joseph played a vital role in the development of lifesaving equipment and innovative communication systems that would ultimately change the face of modern warfare and rescue operations. It was during this time that Joseph's efforts paid off in an unexpected way. Ten years after Lawrence had been declared missing in action, a recovery team stumbled upon a hidden underground bunker where a group of survivors had been living in hiding, one of whom was Lawrence. Against all odds, these soldiers had managed to stay alive and elude enemy capture, thanks to their fortitude, loyalty, and comradery. Upon learning of Lawrence's rescue, Joseph was overjoyed. It was nothing short of a miracle. The friends were reunited, their bond now deeper than ever. Lawrence expressed his gratitude to Joseph for his relentless pursuit of innovation, insisting that the technology Joseph had helped develop contributed significantly to the successful recovery mission and the survival of his entire unit. From that day forward, Lawrence and Joseph understood the true meaning of brotherhood, knowing that despite their different journeys, they would always be there for each other. They continued to share their stories, dreams, and passions. And while their friendship had been tempered in the crucible of war and loss, it emerged stronger and more resilient, firmly cementing their unique bond for the rest of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

José Mourinho not convinced about signing Cesc Fábregas for Chelsea José Mourinho is unconvinced about signing Cesc Fábregas with the Chelsea manager retaining a preference for Atlético Madrid’s Koke, the midfielder with whom Barcelona want to replace the former Arsenal captain. Fábregas has been told by the Catalan club that he is for sale for £30m. The 27-year-old would prefer to return to the Premier League and to a Champions League club, his options have narrowed to Chelsea, as Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City have all – for the moment, at least – passed up the opportunity to buy him. With Louis van Gaal, the new manager of Manchester United, having also not identified Fábregas as a priority as the Dutchman seeks to rebuild the squad, the Chelsea hierarchy have presented the Spaniard to Mourinho as an ideal goal-scoring midfield successor to Frank Lampard, who is leaving after 13 years at the west London club. Mourinho, however, is unsure about the Spaniard, preferring instead to target Koke. And, with Mourinho having also sold another diminutive goal-scoring playmaker in Juan Mata to United in January, plus Fabregas’s history with the Portuguese, whether he joins Chelsea is in the balance. In February Fábregas told Mourinho to “shut up” after the 50-year-old had branded Barça the worst team the club had fielded in “many, many years”. Although Mourinho would rather sign Koke, Barça are favourites to do so. Koke is five-years younger than Fábregas and was part of the successful Atlético side that won La Liga and were 90 seconds away from defeating Real Madrid to lift the Champions League. Given that Fábregas has won the World Cup and the last two European Championships with Spain and is a proven Premier League performer the reluctance of three of the clubs competing in next season’s elite competition – plus United – to buy him is a big surprise. Fábregas is understood to be relaxed about the situation, though with Spain’s World Cup defence starting on Thursday-week in Brazil, whether his future can be decided before then becomes less likely as the tournament nears. Fábregas’s stock has fallen considerably from last summer. Then, United had a £35m bid for him rejected by Barça, with Fábregas prepared to move to Old Trafford had his club been prepared to sell. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. José Mourinho, the coach of Chelsea, is not sure about signing the soccer player Cesc Fábregas, because he prefers another player named Koke. 2. Cesc Fábregas is a good soccer player, but some teams do not want to buy him right now. 3. Cesc Fábregas wants to play for a team in the Premier League, a popular soccer league in England, and for a team that plays in the Champions League. 4. Barcelona, the team where Cesc Fábregas currently plays, wants to sell him for £30 million (a lot of money). 5. José Mourinho and Cesc Fábregas have had disagreements in the past. 6.

The Labour leader's campaign team hit back accusing Mr Watson of \\"peddling baseless conspiracy theories\\" but the deputy leader then wrote a letter to Mr Corbyn urging him to take action against infiltrators. Trotskyism has its origins in early 20th Century Russian politics and the path pursued by one of the founders of the Soviet Union, Leon Trotsky. Trotsky was the head of the Red Army and a key player in the violent revolution that toppled the Russian tsar and established the world's first socialist state. But he split with the other revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin, who believed they could create a socialist society in their own country without a world revolution.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who came of age during a period when a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality?, using the article: Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his..., what would be the answer ?

The Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama film with elements of film noir, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren, which tells the story of a drug addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. Although the addictive drug is never identified in the film, according to the American Film Institute \\"most contemporary and modern sources assume that it is heroin\\", in contrast to Algren's book which named the drug as morphine. The film stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger. Preminger decided to release the finished film prior to submitting it for a Code seal of approval. He contended that his film would not entice any viewers to take drugs, since drug use was depicted as having severely negative consequences. The black-and-white film was also the first to portray heroin use as a serious literary topic, rejecting the standard \\"dope fiend\\" approach of the time. United Artists, which had invested 1 million in the film's production, opted to distribute the film, even though doing so could result in the company being fined 25,000 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The president of United Artists, Arthur Krim, expressed the company's hope that the PCA would make an exception to its usual rules and grant the film approval because of the film's \\"immense potential for public service.\\" The film received several advance bookings in November and early December 1955, before the PCA had made a decision on whether to grant a Code seal. However, in early December 1955, the PCA denied the film a Code seal, and the decision was upheld upon appeal to the MPAA. As a result, United Artists resigned from the MPAA that same month (although the company re-joined a few years later). The National Legion of Decency also showed disagreement with the PCA ruling by rating the film as a \\"B\\" meaning \\"morally objectionable in part for all\\", instead of a \\"C\\" meaning \\"condemned\\", which was the rating normally given to films that were denied a Code seal. Large theater circuits including Loews also refused to ban the film and instead showed it despite the lack of a Code seal. As a result of the controversy, the MPAA investigated and revised production codes, allowing later movies more freedom to deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, miscegenation, abortion, and prostitution. In the end, The Man With The Golden Arm finally received the Production Code seal number 17011 in June 1961, which permitted the film to be reissued and sold for television broadcast.

Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to make the 3rd century politically unstable, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the 3rd century, mainly in response to the war with Sassanid Persia, which revived in the middle of the 3rd century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.\\"?

I wanted \\"Dumbo,\\" but my sisters won out, and we got \\"Cinderella.\\" They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures. A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched \\"Cinderella\\" together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched \\"Cinderella\\" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like \\"Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo\\" and \\"A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes\\" sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle. Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world. While \\"Cinderella\\" may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids.

Afghans lower the coffin of Afghan cameraman Zubair Hatami, who died on Saturday of injuries sustained in a Taliban attack at a French cultural centre, in Kabul December 21, 2014. KABUL Afghanistan's Taliban on Sunday accused the United Nations of \\"enmity and political motives\\" in reporting that three-quarters of a record-high number of civilians killed and wounded this year were victims of the insurgents. Denouncing a U.N. report as \\"biased and unfounded\\", the insurgents accused U.N. investigators of intentionally skewing statistics to blame the Taliban. The United Nations said that for a second year, insurgents were responsible for about 75 percent of civilians killed, with the toll reaching a new high of 3,188 through November, more than for any other full year since it began tracking numbers. The Taliban said in a statement emailed to journalists the assertion was false. \\"Civilian casualties in the current war are mainly caused by the heavy blind U.S. air bombardments,\\" the militants said, citing disputed reports that a U.S. air strike killed several school children last week. They also asserted that Afghan army, police and militias indiscriminately kill civilians and slammed the United Nations for classifying government officials who were assassinated as civilians - the Taliban consider all Afghan government workers legitimate targets. The United Nations called on Friday on all sides of the war to work to limit civilian deaths and injuries. (Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — At least 151 Taliban fighters have been killed by government forces during 12 days of fighting in the volatile east, near the border with Pakistan, the police chief of Kunar province said Tuesday. Gen. Abdul Habib Sayedkhaili said at least another 100 insurgents were wounded in the fighting in Dangam district. He said the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-i-Taiba -- the group responsible for the attacks on Mumbai in 2008 in which more than 160 people were killed -- were also taking part in the battle. \\"That 17 foreign fighters that were killed during the battle prove that foreigners are supporting local insurgents in the area,\\" he said. \\"As Dangam is so close to the border, it is very easy for them to cross the border into Afghanistan and help the insurgents here. We are very careful with conducting our operations to prevent civilian casualties,\\" he said. The presence of foreign fighters in Taliban battles in Afghanistan is not unusual. The Afghan Taliban leadership is believed to be based in the Pakistani city of Quetta, and Kabul has long accused Pakistan of turning a blind eye to the group. Dangam is four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the porous border. The Taliban denied losing so many fighters but did not provide their own figures. Sayedkhaili said local people had joined the fight against the insurgents, and that five had been killed and 12 wounded, including both locals and security forces. He said there was no involvement of either Pakistani government forces or international forces that have been based in Afghanistan for the past 13 years. The U.S. and NATO are due to withdraw the last of their combat troops on Dec. 31, leaving behind a residual force of 13,000 to provide training and some battlefield backup. Taliban attacks have escalated since international forces withdrew from Kunar four months ago and the fight across the country has intensified. Kabul and Islamabad have discussed joining forces to launch operations against insurgent groups following last week's school massacre in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, in which Pakistani Taliban fighters killed more than 140 people, mainly children. Gen. Sher Muhammad Karimi, chief of the general staff of the Afghan National Army and Gen. John Campbell, commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, met with the head of the Pakistani army, Gen. Raheel Sharif, in Islamabad on Tuesday, Pakistan's military said in a statement. The statement referred to \\"recently commenced operations by Afghan forces\\" against the Pakistani Taliban in areas close to border. \\"Gen. Raheel Sharif vowed to extend full support to the visiting Afghan Chief of General Staff and ISAF Commander in all spheres, including coordinated operations in respective areas by both sides and sharing of intelligence,\\" it said, without further elaboration. Senior Afghan officials have said that no joint Afghan-Pakistani operations have yet been launched in border areas, but that cooperation against the Taliban is being discussed. ||||| Georgette Gagnon, director of human rights for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), speaks during a news conference in Kabul July 31, 2013. KABUL At least 3,188 Afghan civilians have been killed in the intensifying war with the Taliban in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants, the United Nations said on Friday. The numbers are a sharp reminder that the Afghan war is far from over, even as a U.S.-led international force formally ends its combat mission at the end of the month, shifting to a supporting role for Afghan forces after 13 years. \\"The situation for civilians in Afghanistan is becoming increasingly dire,\\" said Georgette Gagnon, human rights director for the U.N. mission in Kabul. As of Nov. 30, the United Nations had recorded a total of 3,188 civilian deaths and 6,429 injuries. That puts 2014 on track to be the first year on record that combined civilian casualties will surpass 10,000. Civilian deaths over the year to the end of November were up 19 percent over the same period last year and had already surpassed the previous high set in 2011, when 3,133 civilians were killed. For the first time, ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces became the main cause of civilian deaths. In previous years, planted bombs killed the most civilians. \\"That is very worrying,\\" said Gagnon, calling on all sides to do more to keep civilians from being caught in crossfire of mortars and other heavy weapons. About three-quarters of civilian casualties were caused by Taliban insurgents, who are intensifying their fight to re-establish their hardline Islamist regime that was toppled in a U.S.-backed military intervention for sheltering the al Qaeda architects of the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities. Since the U.N. began tracking civilian casualties in 2009, a total of 17,252 civilian deaths and 29,536 injuries have been recorded. While U.S. military officials have portrayed the war as in the process of being won by Afghan security forces, the national army and police have also suffered record losses this year, with more than 4,600 killed. Since 2001, nearly 3,500 foreign soldiers from 29 countries have been killed in Afghanistan, including about 2,200 Americans. (Editing by Robert Birsel) ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government continues to intensify, with civilian casualties reaching record high numbers. The United Nations reported that 3,188 Afghan civilians were killed in 2014, making it the deadliest year on record for non-combatants. These numbers highlight the fact that the war in Afghanistan is far from being resolved, even as the U.S.-led international force formally ends its combat mission and transitions to support Afghan forces. The intensifying conflict has led to significant civilian suffering, with ground battles between the Taliban and Afghan forces becoming the primary cause of civilian deaths for the first time. Previously, planted bombs were responsible for the highest number of civilian casualties. The Taliban are responsible for around 75% of civilian casualties, as they continue to fight in order to re-establish their hardline Islamist regime that was toppled in 2001.

Saleyha Ahsan (pictured) is one of the presenters of Trust Me I'm a Doctor: Summer Special, on BBC Two, Tuesday 12 July at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayer Take the test: How can I lose an inch of belly fat in four weeks? Visceral fat is believed to be more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat and has a higher turnover. If you gain weight you put it on there first - and if you lose weight, you lose it from there first. Although it is considered the more dangerous to our health, the good news is that it is easier to shift than the subcutaneous fat. But the question is how. On health and fitness websites you can see the promise of \\"spot reduction\\" of belly fat. These are the quick-fix tricks that promise to help melt fat away. But how reliable are they? The Trust Me I'm A Doctor team have done some experiments to finally get to the bottom of it. So how do you get rid of it? We recruited 35 volunteers - splitting them into four groups - along with two experts in the field of exercise and diet. All the volunteers carried abdominal fat which gave them waist sizes that put them in the danger zone for type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Fredrik Karpe, a professor of metabolic medicine from the University of Oxford, and Prof Dylan Thompson, from the University of Bath, each had to come up with two methods to try with the four groups, aligned with their own areas of expertise. Before the experiment, each person had their health parameters taken. One of the most crucial measurements was a DEXA scan - short for dual X-ray absorptiometry - to get a really detailed picture of the amount of fat everyone had and where it was distributed. Other health parameters were measured - resting heart rate, blood glucose, blood lipids, weight, blood pressure and of course waistline measurements. Prof Thompson took on two groups for two types of exercises, while Prof Karpe took two groups for two dietary interventions. The first of Prof Thompson's groups wore monitors to check activity throughout the day and the volunteers were told to eat as they normally would. He gave them simple lifestyle changes to make them more active and increase their daily step count. Prof Thompson's second group was given a classic internet belly-fat fix - sit-ups. Each volunteer did six exercises three times each - every other day over the six-week period. Lie on your back, knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Place your hands on your thighs, across your chest or behind your ears. Slowly curl up towards your knees until your shoulders are about three inches off the floor. Hold the position for a few seconds and lower down slowly. The third group, monitored by Prof Karpe, was given the task of following another popular online belly fat reduction suggestion - consuming up to three glasses of milk (one litre) a day. Is it time to Make Your Move? Find out about our new campaign promoting accessible, physical challenges for everyone here. There has been research suggesting that dairy consumption might promote fat excretion. Fat comes out in the faeces rather than being absorbed. The fourth group was the diet group. They were not told to change the type of food they ate. Their task was simply to reduce portion size, measuring foods with their hands and fingers. They were also told to cut out snacks between meals. The aim was to make this as easy to follow as possible - if people are given separate meal plans from the rest of the family it can be difficult to follow and more expensive. A dietician supported this group through the process, giving the volunteers coping strategies if they were suffering from hunger pangs. She had individual sessions with everyone at the start and continued to support them during the six weeks with phone calls. At the end of the six-week period, all the participants were tested again on waistline, blood cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure. The results were rather revealing. The first exercise group didn't lose any fat, but their health markers vastly improved, with drops in blood pressure and one participant even reducing their blood glucose levels from being in the diabetic range to normal. The sit-up group didn't lose any weight and didn't get any healthier through their parameters. But they did lose an impressive 2cm (0.8in) from their waistlines. Prof Thompson explained that this was due to an improved core strength and the muscles in the abdomen just holding their fat better. A bit like a muscle version of body-shaping underwear. But a good core is beneficial for protection against lower back pain and improves posture. Turning to Prof Karpe's groups - the milk drinkers didn't show any change in weight or health. However although they were being asked to consume an extra 400 calories a day they didn't gain any weight or fat. Prof Karpe thought this might be to do with them being too full from milk to eat as they normally do. The clear winner was the diet-control group. This group lost a collective 35kg (77lb) between them which was an average of 3.7kg (8.2lb) each over just six weeks. Their average waistline reduced by 5cm (2in). The DEXA scan readings were the most interesting with 5% less body fat and an impressive 14% reduction of the dangerous visceral fat inside the abdomen. This group lost overall body fat as well as abdominal fat. They also saw improvements in the health parameters. But they did lose some muscle tone from their legs, which is not a good thing. Thus, the conclusion is that if you want to bust the belly fat in a healthy and effective way, it's the age-old advice of a combination of diet and exercise. Leave the fads where you found them. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook Trust Me I'm a Doctor: Summer Special is on BBC Two, Tuesday 12 July at 20:00 BST - catch up on BBC iPlayer What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Belly fat, both subcutaneous fat and the more dangerous visceral fat around our organs, can be a sign of increased health risks. Numerous ways to lose belly fat have been suggested, but a study conducted by the Trust Me I'm A Doctor team found that simple diet control was the most effective method. Participants in the diet control group lost an average of 8.2lb and reduced their waistlines by 2 inches over a six-week period. The conclusion is that a combination of a healthy diet and consistent exercise is the best way to lose belly fat safely and effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests. They had one of the largest concentration of tropical species. In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact. Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is more likely that Costa Rica's indigenous animals would have a higher chance of surviving and staying put in their natural habitat. This is due to several reasons: 1. Preservation of Pristine Forests: Costa Rica has maintained its pristine forests, providing a continuous and undisturbed habitat for the indigenous species. These forests serve as crucial breeding and nesting grounds and also supply abundant food sources for the native wildlife. On the other hand, the deforestation in Nicaragua for sugarcane production has resulted in the loss of natural habitats for many species, forcing them to relocate or face diminishing populations due to habitat fragmentation. 2. Ecotourism Initiatives: Costa Rica has made substantial efforts in promoting ecotourism as a significant source of income. This has led to a focus on preserving natural resources, such as the country's pristine forests, to attract tourists. This approach has also helped in generating awareness and providing financial incentives for conservation efforts, ultimately benefiting the indigenous animals that rely on these habitats for their survival. 3. Conservation Policies: Costa Rica has implemented multiple conservation policies to protect its flora and fauna. The country has designated nearly 26 percent of its land as protected areas in the form of national parks, wildlife refuges, and biological reserves. These protected areas create a safe sanctuary for many indigenous species, helping to ensure their long-term survival. 4. Biodiversity Programs: Costa Rica has also invested in various biodiversity programs and partnerships with international organizations, such as the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and the Convention on Biological Diversity. These programs focus on research, conservation, and sustainable use of the country's biological resources, ultimately benefiting the indigenous wildlife and their habitats. 5. Resilience to Climate Change: By preserving their forests, Costa Rica has contributed to the overall resilience of their ecosystems against the impacts of climate change. Forests help in regulating climate, providing a buffer against temperature extremes and weather variations. This stability ensures that the indigenous species have a more predictable and stable environment in which to thrive. In conclusion, it is more likely that the indigenous animals of Costa Rica would survive and stay put due to the country's dedication to preserving its pristine forests, implementing conservation policies, supporting ecotourism initiatives, and investing in biodiversity programs. These factors help maintain the ecological integrity of the country's natural habitats and provide a secure environment for the survival of its native wildlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Without calling myself an habitue, I certainly know enough about the Cirque du Soleil to know what to expect. Until now, that is. Even though this does have some elements of the Cirque du Soleil, acrobatics don't feature as heavily in Love. Nevertheless, the show was stunning and fabulous and the set design eclipsed anything I've seen until now. Set to The Beatles' Love soundtrack by George & Giles, the show is immensely entertaining.

It was the last day I worked. Memorial Day at the city rec center is SLOW, especially when it's beautiful outside, but for some reason, we had two front desk attendants: me, and “bully #1”. Bully #1 clearly had a major distaste for me. She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me. Bully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style. On this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts. I was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning. I spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her: “What do you know about Machiavellianism?” I swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose.

Michael Andrew McKagan grew up in Seattle's largely working-class University District, the youngest of eight children born to Marie and Elmer \\"Mac\\" McKagan. He has been called \\"Duff\\" since toddlerhood, to which he once referred as \\"an Irish thing\\". Following his parents' divorce, his mother supported the family by taking a job as a medical stenographer. He was taught how to play bass by his brother Bruce, further developing his skills by playing along with the albums 1999 by Prince and Damaged by Black Flag. In April 1985, McKagan replaced bassist Ole Beich in Guns N' Roses, which was newly founded by singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin of Hollywood Rose. McKagan's Road Crew bandmates Slash and Steven Adler joined the band two months later. After two days of rehearsal, the line-up played its debut gig at The Troubadour on June 6. In 1987, Guns N' Roses released its debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, 18 million of which were in the United States, making it the best-selling debut album of all time in the U.S. The following year, the band released G N' R Lies, which sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide. In 1990, Steven Adler was fired from the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult. In May 1991, Guns N' Roses embarked on the two-and-a-half-year-long Use Your Illusion Tour. The following September, the band released the long-awaited albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively on the U.S. chart, a feat unachieved by any other group. In November 1991, Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band; he was replaced by Gilby Clarke of Kill For Thrills. In 1993, the band released \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\", a cover album of mostly punk songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. McKagan took on lead vocals on four songs, including live favorite \\"Attitude\\", originally by the Misfits. That same year, McKagan released his debut solo album, Believe in Me, on which he sang lead vocals and played virtually every instrument. In 1995, with Guns N' Roses largely inactive, McKagan formed the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders with Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, John Taylor of Duran Duran, and his Guns N' Roses bandmate Matt Sorum. Originally a gathering of friends jamming together at the Viper Room in Hollywood, they released their self-titled album on Maverick Records in 1996. The band played a brief tour of Europe and North America, before disbanding in 1997. McKagan was the last member of the Appetite for Destruction lineup to leave Guns N' Roses, resigning as bassist in August 1997. McKagan had recently become a father and wrote about his decision to leave in his autobiography, stating \\"Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now--from 1994 to 1997--and still did not have a single song.

A paleontologist named Zack takes his nephew Ricky and niece Jade on a fossil hunt. While alone, Ricky is met by a talking raven, who turns into an Alexornis named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the Cretaceous period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of Pachyrhinosaurus hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader Gorgon fights and kills Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd (now led by Bulldust's rival Major) combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. There, Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above.

Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.

Passage:Described by will.i.am as \\"party album[s]\\", The Black Eyed Peas released the electronic dance-influenced The E.N.D. and The Beginning in 2009 and 2010, following the 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. The band welcomed Obama's election; will.i.am had recorded and released \\"Yes We Can\\", a single that promoted Obama's election campaign during the Democratic Party primaries, and often claims the song had helped Obama get elected. The band's most commercially successful single during this period, \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", was inspired by the band's perception of being \\"in the center of a ginormous change in America\\". The track became the best-selling digital song of all time until it was surpassed by Pharrell Williams' \\"Happy\\" in 2014. By the end of 2010, The E.N.D. had sold over eleven million copies worldwide, while The Beginning had sold over two million copies worldwide. The band had intended to return to the studio to create their seventh studio album soon after the release of The Beginning, though frequent delays and Taboo's diagnosis with testicular cancer in 2014, along with his subsequent treatment and recovery, led to the project being put on hiatus.

This can be convenient if there is an aggressive antivirus on the computer that prevents the creation of dummydrivers Add punctuation","completion":"This can be convenient if there is an aggressive antivirus on the computer that prevents the creation of dummy drivers. In certain situations, aggressive antivirus software can cause issues when it comes to creating dummy drivers. These dummy drivers are useful when testing or debugging certain aspects of computer systems or the software running on them. However, when an aggressive antivirus is present, it can mistakenly flag and block the creation of these drivers. This can lead to a disruption in the workflow, slow down the development process, and even cause harm to the system if it prevents essential updates or patches from being applied. To avoid these inconveniences, you have several options to work around the issue and ensure that your projects can proceed unimpeded. Some possible solutions include: 1. Temporarily disabling the antivirus: You can deactivate the antivirus just for the duration of the dummy driver creation process. However, it's important to remember that this leaves your system vulnerable, so it's crucial to turn it back on as soon as possible. Moreover, this may not be a real solution for corporate environments with strict security measures and policies. 2. Adding exceptions to the antivirus: A less risky approach is to add your dummy driver development tools and the folder containing your dummy driver files to the whitelist or exceptions of your antivirus software. This will allow you to create and work with dummy drivers without interference from the antivirus. Keep in mind that this might also require approval from your IT department or security team. 3. Using alternative development environments: You may consider using a virtual machine (VM) or a physical system specifically designated for dummy driver development and testing. This enables you to isolate the environment and bypass the aggressive antivirus, allowing you to create the drivers without any obstructions. However, this can demand extra resources and setup time. 4. Selecting a different antivirus: Another solution is to switch to antivirus software that is less prone to flagging dummy drivers. Many antivirus programs have different levels of sensitivity and options that can be adjusted so that the software adequately protects your system while not impeding your development process. 5. Collaborating with your security team: If you are working in an organization with a dedicated security team, consider discussing the problem with them. They might be able to provide a solution that aligns with your organization's security policies and practices while still allowing you to create dummy drivers. By weighing these options and choosing the best approach for your specific situation, you can work around an aggressive antivirus on your computer and ensure the successful creation of dummy drivers without compromising your system's security."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This treaty was a crucial event in the early years of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which was seeking to end its participation in the war in order to focus on establishing control over its internal affairs and addressing the consequences of the ongoing Russian Civil War. The surrendered territories included regions such as present-day Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), as well as parts of Poland and other areas that were then under the control of the Russian Empire. The loss of these lands had significant political, economic, and social impacts on the newly-formed Russian SFSR. Ultimately, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was annulled by the Treaty of Versailles (signed in June 1919), which ended World War I.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts. Problem:Context_1 : Thespesia is a genus of 18 floweringshrubs and trees in the \\"Hibiscus\\" family, Malvaceae, although within the family they are more closely related to cotton plants (\\"Gossypium\\"). The genus is distributed from the South Pacific through Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Context_2 : An institutional investor is an entity which pools money to purchase securities, real property, and other investment assets or originate loans. Institutional investors include banks, insurance companies, pensions, hedge funds, REITs, investment advisors, endowments, and mutual funds. Operating companies which invest excess capital in these types of assets may also be included in the term. Activist institutional investors may also influence corporate governance by exercising voting rights in their investments. Although institutional investors appear to be more sophisticated than retail investors, it remains unclear if professional active investment managers can reliably enhance risk adjusted returns by an amount that exceeds fees and expenses of investment management. Context_3 : A commodity pool is an investment structure where many individual investors combine their moneys and trade in futures contracts as a single entity in order to gain leverage. They are analogous to mutual funds wherein a fund is similarly set up expressly for trading in equity, except that mutual funds are open to public subscription whereas commodity pools and hedge funds are private. Context_4 : A business entity is an entity that is formed and administered as per corporate law in order to engage in business activities, charitable work, or other activities allowable. Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability company and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases, Context_5 : In computer programming, a declaration is a language construct that specifies properties of an identifier: it declares what a word (identifier) \\"means:.\\" Declarations are most commonly used for functions, variables, constants, and classes, but can also be used for other entities such as enumerations and type definitions. Beyond the name (the identifier itself) and the kind of entity (function, variable, etc.), declarations typically specify the data type (for variables and constants), or the type signature (for functions); types may also include dimensions, such as for arrays. A declaration is used to announce the existence of the entity to the compiler; this is important in those strongly typed languages that require functions, variables, and constants, and their types to be specified with a declaration before use, and is used in forward declaration. The term \\"declaration\\" is frequently contrasted with the term \\"definition\\", but meaning and usage varies significantly between languages; see below. Context_6 : In the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), an entity is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as codice_1). Entities are foundational to the organizational structure and definition of SGML documents. The SGML specification defines numerous entity types, which are distinguished by keyword qualifiers and context. An entity string value may variously consist of plain text, SGML tags, and/or references to previously-defined entities. Certain entity types may also invoke external documents. Entities are called by reference. Context_7 : In mathematics and computer science, mutual recursion is a form of recursion where two mathematical or computational objects, such as functions or data types, are defined in terms of each other. Mutual recursion is very common in functional programming and in some problem domains, such as recursive descent parsers, where the data types are naturally mutually recursive, but is uncommon in other domains. Context_8 : Thespesia populnea, commonly known as the Indian tulip tree, Pacific rosewood, or Portia tree , is species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is a small tree or arborescent shrub that has a pantropical distribution, found on coasts around the world. However, the Portia tree is probably native only to the Old World, and may have originated in India. Nowadays, its wood is mainly used in making furniture because of its good ability to undergo carving. The wood from the tree was used by early Tamil people to make instruments in ancient Tamilakam. It is possibly indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in the Pacific, but may have been spread by early Polynesians for its useful wood and bast fibres. The Portia tree reaches a height of 6 - tall and a trunk diameter of 20 - . It grows at elevations from sea level to 275 m in areas that receive 500 - of annual rainfall. The Portia tree is able to grow in the wide range of soil types that may be present in coastal environments, including soils derived from quartz (sand), limestone, and basalt; it favours neutral soils (pH of 6–7.4). Context_9 : Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 40 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. Certain species of \\"Spathiphyllum\\" are commonly known as Spath or peace lilies. Context_10 : An entity–relationship model (ER model) describes inter-related things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge. An ER model is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between instances of those entity types. fact_1 : Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 40 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. fact_2 : Thespesia is a genus of 18 floweringshrubs and trees in the \\"Hibiscus\\" family, Malvaceae, although within the family they are more closely related to cotton plants (\\"Gossypium\\").

Answer based on context: The Mexican Empire was quickly overthrown under the Plan of Casa Mata, the provinces of the empire became independent states. The first Republic of Yucatán, declared on May 29, 1823, joined the Federal Republic of the United Mexican States as the Federated Republic of Yucatán on December 23, 1823. The second Republic of Yucatán emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucatán and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825 was broken by the centralist government of Mexico since 1835. In 1841 the state of Tabasco decreed its separation from Mexico and Miguel Barbachano, then governor of Yucatán, sent a commission headed by Justo Sierra O'Reilly to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842. On August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president José Mariano Salas restored the 1824 constitution and the federalism. Two years later, during the government of president José Joaquín de Herrera, Miguel Barbachano ordered the reinstatement of Yucatán to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the Caste War, which forced Yucatán to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, was created the Territory of Campeche. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Benito Juárez, Campeche gained its current status as an independent state. When was the constitution restored by Salas?","completion":"The constitution was restored by José Mariano Salas on August 22, 1846."},{"prompt":"Question: What did Father Lankester Merrin serve as in World War II?

He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in the occupied Netherlands during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who asks him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. â long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa.

Where might she walk? Options: - roof - tree - ground - forest - fall season Answer:","completion":"Sally, being an admirer of the beautiful colors of fallen leaves in autumn, would most likely choose to take her long walks in a forest during September. The forest is the most logical and fitting choice, as it provides an environment where Sally can fully embrace and appreciate the autumn scenery. Forests, particularly during autumn, showcase an abundance of fallen leaves exhibiting vibrant shades of reds, oranges, and yellows. Taking long walks through forest trails allows for a more intimate and immersive experience, as she would be surrounded by the very foliage that she loves. Additionally, September is the perfect time to witness this spectacular display of natural beauty, as it marks the beginning of fall and the transition of colors in many temperate regions. The other options provided do not align with common sense or the context of the question. Walking on the roof or tree is not only impractical, but also dangerous, as both surfaces are not intended for walking. Furthermore, the \\"ground\\" option is too broad and lacks the contextual relevance to enjoying fallen leaves. Lastly, \\"fall season\\" is not a location where someone can walk but rather a period of time when autumn occurs, which was already established in the question. In conclusion, to fully enjoy the color of fallen leaves in autumn, Sally would most likely choose to take her long walks through a forest during the month of September.

Today we're going to talk about a big company called News International. This company has many newspapers, and in the past, they did some things they shouldn't have. They listened to people's private telephone conversations by secretly hacking into their phones! That's like someone secretly looking at your diary without your permission, which is not a nice thing to do. Recently, News International said they agreed to settle, or fix a problem with people who were unhappy with them. But they didn't tell us any more information about the settlements. Imagine you had a disagreement with a friend about taking their toy, and you two decided to make peace with each other, that's called settling. One of the people who was upset with News International is a famous actor named Jude Law. He got £130,000 (a lot of money!) in damages, which means this is what they gave him to fix the problem caused by listening to his private phone calls. Jude Law said that the behavior of one of the newspapers, called News of the World, was appalling. That's a big word meaning very bad and shocking. But Jude Law wasn't the only one whose phone was hacked. Even a journalist who worked for other newspapers from News International had his phone hacked too. In our world, it's important to treat everybody nicely, and that includes people like journalists who write news stories for us to read. The lawyers (people who help others in the court) for the unhappy people said that News International tried to destroy evidence. Evidence is something that shows a fact or helps to prove something happened. So, they are saying that News International tried to get rid of or hide the proof that they did something wrong. That's the end of our story for today. We learned that News International has acknowledged their mistakes and settled with the people they hurt. It's a big reminder for all of us to always be kind, honest, and respect other people's privacy.

It occurs between particles or objects. It causes them to attract or repel each other. They do not even have to touch. This is unlike the typical push or pull you may be familiar with. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge. An electron has a negative electric charge. Forces on Charged Objects Most atoms are balanced electrically. They have the same number of positive and negative charges. Therefore, the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Neutrons do not matter as they have no charge. When an object loses some electrons, it becomes positively charged. There are now more protons than electrons inside the atom. The lost electrons may remain free. Or, they may attach to another object. The new object now has more electrons than protons. It then becomes negatively charged.

May 20, 2014, 11:42 PM GMT / Updated May 21, 2014, 12:00 AM GMT Five men were convicted Tuesday in Moscow in the 2006 execution-style murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Russian state media reported. Politkovskaya, a crusading reporter for the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta who worked almost full-time on documenting allegations of human rights violations in the breakaway province of Chechnya, was 48 when she was gunned down in the elevator of her apartment building in October 2006. The murder raised worldwide questions about freedom of speech and of the press under Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially after three of the defendants were initially acquitted in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned those acquittals and ordered a new trial. ||||| People hold portraits of slain journalist Anna Politkovskaya on the sixth anniversary of her death, next to her block of flats in central Moscow October 7, 2012. MOSCOW (Reuters) - Five men were convicted on Tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial. Politkovskaya's killing drew attention to the risks faced by Russians who challenge the authorities and deepened Western concerns for the rule of law under President Vladimir Putin, who was then serving his second term. Another jury's 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on Tuesday embarrassed Russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial. The defendants were three Chechen brothers, one of whom was accused of shooting Politkovskaya in the lobby of her Moscow apartment building on October 7, 2006, as well as their uncle and a former police officer. The convictions are a victory for Russian prosecutors and the state, but rights activists and relatives of Politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted. \\"The murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known,\\" a lawyer for Politkovskaya's family, Anna Stavitskaya, was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. She welcomed the jury's verdict but said the men found guilty \\"are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice\\", RIA reported. A spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, Vladimir Markin, said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing, Russian news agencies reported. Kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government. Politkovskaya, a reporter for Novaya Gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries, was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya. Lawyers for the defendants - Rustam Makhmudov, his brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail, their uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal. Investigators say Gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter, while Khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov helped track her. Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and Khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted. The five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison. Prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on Wednesday, RIA reported.

One man was found guilty of the shooting and the other four of organising the killing. Three of the men were brothers from Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya, a 48-year-old investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats. Three of the men had been acquitted of the murder in a 2009 trial. The initial verdict was overturned by Russia's supreme court, which ordered their retrial. One of the brothers, Rustam Makhmudov, was found guilty of pulling the trigger. His brothers were found guilty of acting as getaway drivers. The brothers' uncle and a retired policeman were also found guilty of organising the killing. Ms Politkovskaya's reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya. But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority. The five men, who face possible life terms, will be sentenced on Wednesday morning. A committee set up to investigate the shooting said it was still looking for the person who ordered the operation. Her family welcomed the verdict but also expressed disappointment that the mastermind of the killing had not yet been found. Last year a former police officer, Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for supplying the murder weapon. Magnitsky sanctions In a separate development, the US announced on Tuesday that it was imposing sanctions on a further 12 Russians believed to be involved in the death of a Moscow lawyer in 2009. Sergei Magnitsky found evidence of a 230m tax-refund fraud Sergei Magnitsky died in prison, allegedly because of torture and neglect, after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud. Following his death, the US passed the Magnitsky Act, aimed at punishing officials involved in his death, and last year published a list of 18 individuals banned from entering the country. Among the names added to the list on Tuesday are three doctors alleged to have withheld treatment from Magnitsky while he was in custody. One of them, Larisa Litvinova, was chief physician at Butyrka maximum security jail where Magnitksy died while another, Dmitry Kratov, was its deputy director. A judge involved in a posthumous prosecution of Magnitsky for tax fraud has also been added to the sanctions list. The US says the sanctions are \\"independent of Russia's actions in Ukraine\\". ||||| Summary:","completion":"Five men were convicted in 2014 for the 2006 murder of Russian investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.

She needed another heart transplant . But the doctors couldn't find a proper heart so soon. Then they came up with an idea -- they would use two machines to keep her blood _ in her body. After waiting for about four months, D' Zhana had another heart transplant. It was very successful. When doctors use a man-made heart to keep a patient's life, they usually leave the patient's own heart in the body. \\"She, we believe, is possibly one of the youngest that had the machines without her own heart,\\" one of D' Zhana Simmons' doctors said.

The goal is to identify all elements from the list 'A' that occur before the last 'i' elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation: Step 1: Understand the inputs. - You are given two inputs: 'i' and 'A'. 'i' is an integer and 'A' is a list. You can think of 'A' as a row of items and 'i' as a certain number of items from the end of the row. Step 2: Look at the specific problem. - In our specific problem, 'i' is 3 and 'A' is ['Q', '2261', 'm', '1869', '6817', '3611', '529', 'L', '369', 's']. - So, these are the last 3 numbers: '369', 'L' & 's'.

Once you have unsweetened almond milk, you add a spoonful of sweetener like sugar or agave syrup for every 4 cups - that's about as much milk as in a large jug. Stir it until you can't see the sweetener anymore - be sure to stir very well! Now the fun part, adding flavors! To make it taste like vanilla, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for every 4 cups of milk. If you really love vanilla, you can add more! Just don't forget to mix it well. If you want a more almond flavor, put a little bit of almond extract too. For chocolate almond milk, you add a spoonful of sugar or agave syrup and 2 spoonfuls of cocoa powder to your milk. You also add a tiny bit of salt, and mix it until everything has disappeared. If you are using already sweetened almond milk, no need to add more sugar. To make chai almond milk, add the sugar or agave syrup, plus a little bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Mix it very well.

Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite. Recently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list. Does that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam into them instead of holding it open. Shanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice. Options: A to give visitors a smile B to drop tea boxes into the trash can C to say thank you to visitors D to hold the door closed for visitors Answer: D to hold the door closed for visitors Question: A:","completion":"According to the article, which of the following actions is NOT considered polite behavior in public places?

Starting with the positive aspects, the critic is clearly impressed with the well-crafted and thought-provoking storyline. They praise the film's nuanced portrayal of African American professionals, breaking stereotypes and showcasing the diverse experiences faced by individuals in various industries. The movie is commended for its ability to raise essential questions about race, identity, and the effect of societal expectations on personal ambition. Furthermore, the critic highlights the exceptional performances by the talented cast, which adds depth and authenticity to the film.

In addition, they note the meticulous attention given to the costumes and set design, which helps create a realistic and immersive experience for the viewer, truly transporting them into the world of these African American professionals. However, the critic does express a few concerns. One of their main issues is the pacing of the movie. They believe that certain sequences could have been streamlined to provide a more robust narrative, capitalizing on the high level of emotional investment in the characters and their storylines. Furthermore, the critic feels that a few moments verge on melodrama, which somewhat detracts from the overall message. Despite these minor concerns, the overall tone of the critique is undeniably positive.

They were highly advanced in technology and science, which they used to make their lives better. However, their hunger for resources soon led them to the brink of destruction. Krypton's core, being rich in a precious element, attracted the attention of miners who exploited it without considering the consequences. It was not long before the relentless mining began to destabilize the planet's core, leading to catastrophic tectonic events and an impending apocalyptic scenario. Amidst this crisis, the planet's council convened an urgent assembly to discuss possible solutions. Many brilliant minds proposed various strategies, but none seemed to hold the key to the salvation of Krypton. It was during this chaotic time that a highly respected scientist named Jor-El emerged as a voice of reason. His research had long predicted the danger of mining Krypton's core, and he had been hard at work attempting to devise a suitable plan of action. In light of the rapidly deteriorating situation, the council decided to entrust Jor-El with the control of the genetics codex, which held the entire biological knowledge and heritage of the Kryptonian race. Jor-El worked tirelessly to find a way to save his people. However, he soon discovered that Krypton's core was beyond salvation, and that the destruction of their planet was imminent. Desperate to preserve the Kryptonian legacy, Jor-El conceived a bold plan to entrust the future of his race to his infant son, Kal-El. He devised a preprogrammed spacecraft that would carry the young child to safety on a distant, habitable planet. When the time came, the selfless Jor-El prepared to say goodbye to his beloved wife and son. He knew that staying behind meant sacrificing his life, but his love for his people and hopes for his son steeled his resolve. Before parting, he placed the genetic codex into his son’s escape vessel, ensuring that the essence of Krypton would live on in the blood of his child. As the planet's destruction drew near, Jor-El launched the spacecraft carrying his precious cargo into the vast reaches of space. Following Jor-El's meticulously calculated coordinates, the spacecraft journeyed across the cosmos and arrived on a small, blue-green planet called Earth. It crash-landed, as designed, near a small Kansas town called Smallville. Here, a kind couple named Jonathan and Martha Kent, who were unable to have children of their own, discovered the infant Kal-El. They loved and raised him as their own, and named him Clark. As Clark grew up, he realized that he was unlike other humans. Burdened by the knowledge of the fate that had befallen his true home, and feeling immense guilt for being the sole survivor of Krypton, he decided that he needed to find a new purpose in life. He knew that he possessed extraordinary abilities given to him by his Kryptonian heritage, and he wanted to use these powers to help others. Thus, Clark set out on a journey around the world. He learned about different cultures, discovered new ways of thinking, and was inspired by the resilience and ingenuity of humankind. During his travels, he realized that he could use his great power to protect Earth, the planet that had taken him in and given him a second chance at life. And so, the once lost and guilt-ridden young man from a distant world embraced his destiny and became Earth's greatest protector, the iconic superhero known as Superman."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sisters Fiona, Evelyn, and Susie Gaylord, are orphaned when first their mother goes down with the Lusitania and then their wealthy father, Major Penn Gaylord, is killed in France in World War I. Before Penn left for France, he told Fiona, the eldest, that the Gaylords have never sold the land they have acquired. However, their half billion dollar inheritance is held up in probate for decades; Fiona complains that they have practically grown up in court. Though they have a New York City Fifth Avenue mansion, the sisters have had to borrow money to live. A French charity claims that Penn made a later will before he died, leaving 10% of the Gaylord estate to it. Though the Gaylords are now willing to give up the 10%, their real antagonist, Charles Barclay, who wants their mansion, and the choice land on which it sits too, so he can tear it down as part of his real estate development, Barclay Square. Fiona is determined not to give in to this. Meanwhile, Evelyn has married an English nobleman, now fighting in the RAF, while Susie is in love with painter Gig Young, despite being married herself. Susanna only stayed with her husband for a few hours, but he refuses to grant her an annulment unless she pays him a great deal of money, to which of course she does not have access.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt.

Это касается как общего восприятия звука, так и его характеристик. Прежде всего, оба устройства имеют хорошую детализацию звука, которая не теряется даже при высокой громкости. Благодаря этому, слушать музыку на таких устройствах становится комфортным, и нет никаких искажений или неприятных помех. Вторым важным параметром является баланс тембра, и здесь iPhone также не уступает iPod. Все частоты звукового диапазона хорошо сбалансированы, что позволяет наслаждаться широким спектром музыкальных композиций. Басы глубокие и мощные, без перегруза и гула, а средние и высокие частоты яркие и чистые. Еще одним преимуществом iPhone является поддержка множества аудиоформатов, таких как MP3, WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless и других. Это позволяет слушать любимые композиции в любом удобном формате и наслаждаться оптимальным качеством звука. Также стоит отметить, что iPhone, как и iPod, имеет встроенный эквалайзер, который позволяет настроить звук под персональные предпочтения слушателя. С его помощью можно придать музыке больше глубины и яркости, а также компенсировать возможные недостатки прослушивания на разных моделях наушников или акустики.

In the first sentence: \\"In 1697, he was returned to Eye as a Whig Member of Parliament, and sat until 1713, when he was re-elected to Lymington.\\" - The commas are used to separate the various parts of the sentence. - \\"he was returned to Eye\\" indicates that he became a Member of Parliament for that place. - \\"when he was re-elected to Lymington\\" specifies the time and place where he was re-elected. In the second sentence: \\"In 1697 he was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Eye, and sat until 1713 when he was re-elected for Lymington.\\" - There is one less comma before the year, which makes the sentence flow differently. - \\"he was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Eye\\" conveys essentially the same information as in the first sentence, but the phrasing is a bit different. - \\"when he was re-elected for Lymington\\" maintains the same meaning as in the first sentence with a slightly different structure. While there are subtle differences in their structure and punctuation, the overall meaning of these two sentences is the same: they both describe a person who became a Member of Parliament for Eye in 1697, held the position until 1713, and was then re-elected for Lymington."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which ruler that Richard Hopkins opposed was overthrown by the Revolution of 1688? A:","completion":"To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts. We can identify three essential components in the question statement: 1. Richard Hopkins 2. A ruler he opposed 3. The Revolution of 1688 Step 1: Identify Richard Hopkins' role First, we need to establish who Richard Hopkins is and his significance in history. Richard Hopkins was a noted politician in 17th-century England. Step 2: Determine rulers Richard Hopkins opposed Now, we need to find out which rulers Richard Hopkins opposed during his political career. Research reveals that Hopkins was a supporter of the Whig party in England, which implies that he would have likely opposed rulers backed by the opposing Tory party. Step 3: Investigate the Revolution of 1688 The Revolution of 1688, also known as the Glorious Revolution, refers to the events that led to the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland and James II of Ireland). He was replaced by his daughter Mary II and her husband William III. The revolution marked an essential milestone in the development of a constitutional monarchy in Britain. Step 4: Identify the overthrown ruler As we already know, the ruler overthrown by the Revolution of 1688 is King James II. Step 5: Verify the relationship between Hopkins and the ruler Now, we have to verify whether Richard Hopkins had an opposing stance against King James II. Since Hopkins was a Whig supporter, he would have likely opposed the reign of James II, given that James II was favored by the Tories. Considering all the steps above, the ruler that Richard Hopkins opposed, who was overthrown by the Revolution of 1688, is: A: King James II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Warbringer is an American thrash metal band formed in 2004. Century Media Records signed Warbringer after seeing them at a local show in LA.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Kieran Corcoran. PUBLISHED:. 11:45 EST, 13 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 11:47 EST, 13 September 2013. Karen Welsh, pictured, was strangled in her home by paranoid schizophrenic John Constantine. A damning investigation into the killing of a nurse by a paranoid schizophrenic has revealed a series of blunders by the NHS, police and probation service. Karen Welsh, 52, was strangled at home by John Constantine, 33, who had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Constantine beat Mrs Welsh and cut her wrists in March 2010 – while he had already breached the conditions of a suspended prison sentence. Mrs Welsh, a nurse, had let Constantine, stay in her Cardiff home as he was homeless after being let out. At the time he was only receiving treatment for depression. But a report into her death by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has said that he was misdiagnosed by doctors, and should also have been arrested by police years earlier. It said that his hospital treatment was ‘inadequate’, and that he was only properly diagnosed as a ‘floridly psychotic’ paranoid schizophrenic after killing Mrs Welsh. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which initially assessed Constantine, was criticised for underestimating the risks he posed. The report said: ‘Had there been a more assertive and less fragmented attempt to gain a better understanding of the risks that he posed, it is possible the killing may have been preventable.’ It also revealed that police and probation officers repeatedly failed to arrest Constantine - who breached the conditions of his suspended sentence for a hammer attack, burglary and car theft in 2008. Karen Welsh, pictured right with her daughter Joanne, left, might not have died if police and doctors had acted properly, a report said. It said: ‘On more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend him and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts.’ Her daughter Joanne Welsh described her heartbreak on finding out that her mother’s death was preventable. She said: ‘It is extremely upsetting to hear the conclusions. ‘My mother could still be alive had it not been for misdiagnosis, failures in communication between the relevant agencies and a lack of mental health awareness. ‘These failings meant that a very dangerous and unwell man was let down and allowed to commit such a devastating crime.’ When Constantine was tried in court for Mrs Welsh’s murder, it emerged that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who had been fit and well until suffering a mental breakdown in 2008. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was sent indefinitely to a maximum security hospital. The court heard that he had changed his name from Kevin Astley to John Constantine after a Keanu Reeves character. Reeves played the occult detective in Constantine, a 2005 occult thriller in which his character can talk to demons. Ruth Walker, head of nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘It is clear that communication between statutory agencies fell short of expectation. ‘Both patients were let down by that failure, with tragic consequences.’ Dr Ruth Hussey, chief medical officer for Wales, said: ‘In this complex case, there were several key findings of concern. ‘The Welsh Government expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case. ‘On behalf of the NHS in Wales, I would like to apologise sincerely to everyone affected by this tragedy.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"So, this story is about a sad event that happened to a lady named Karen Welsh. She was a nurse who let a man named John Constantine stay in her home because he didn't have a place to live. John had some problems with his mind, and the doctors didn't understand how bad his problems were. They thought he was just very sad, but he actually had a more serious condition called paranoid schizophrenia. Unfortunately, John hurt Karen very badly, and she passed away. After this happened, people looked into what went wrong and found out that the hospital, police, and probation service made mistakes in taking care of John. They should have known that he had a very serious mental problem and needed help, but they didn't. Karen's daughter is very sad because she found out that if the people taking care of John had done a better job, her mother might still be alive. Now the people in charge are saying sorry and they want to learn from this mistake so it doesn't happen again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?

Therefore, logically, the next step for Remy would be to wait for the ride. If Alex had made Remy call his mother, it suggests that they are unable or unwilling to go home by other means such as walking or public transportation, which excludes “C: walk home” from being the accurate answer. Additionally, “A: were ready to go home” is not a suitable response as it refers to a state of being (ready to go home) rather than an action that will occur next. Hence, based on the limited context and the options provided, the best answer to the question of what Remy will want to do next would be “B: wait for the ride”.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The 4G LTE CellSpot is a like a mini-tower for your house or office. (Photo: T-Mobile) NEW YORK—Your cellphone coverage is pretty good in the neighborhoods where you live and work, but securing a decent signal inside your house has proved to be a challenge. On Monday, T-Mobile announced T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot, an 8.5-inch tall and 8.5-inch wide box which plugs into your Internet router and which the company claims can provide an average of 3,000 square feet of full-bar LTE coverage indoors. Based on \\"femtocell\\" or \\"small cell\\" technology, T-Mobile says this is the first-ever 4G LTE mini-tower available from a U.S. wireless provider. LTE (Long Term Evolution) is the prevailing 4th generation of speedy wireless. T-Mobile's solution is like putting a tiny cell phone tower in the home to improve coverage in the basement or other areas where network coverage might be shaky. T-Mobile is giving CellSpot to its post-paid customers for free, though you'll have to leave a refundable 25 deposit, and remain a T-Mobile customer. Post-paid refers to the lucrative segment of customers who pay their wireless bills each month. The low-power box becomes available on Wednesday. If you're a qualifying customer, you can request CellSpot in a T-Mobile store but the company won't have them in stock and is instead shipping out units. T-Mobile is also pushing the benefit to its small business customers, since the 4G LTE CellSpot supports up to 16 calls at one time and works with any 3G, 4G or LTE device that is compatible with T-Mobile's network. But you'll need a T-Mobile phone to tap into the signal. It's a \\"huge feat of engineering,\\" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a statement. Under Legere, T-Mobile has been building out and bolstering its 4G LTE network coverage, while attempting to also improve the company's reputation. Its 4G network now reaches more than 300 million people in the U.S., which T-Mobile claims puts the carrier on par with Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Still, the 4G LTE CellSpot could help provide coverage to consumers in less populated areas , where T-Mobile's coverage may not be as strong as its rivals. This isn't the first time T-Mobile has tried to bolster indoor coverage. In September of last year, T-Mobile unveiled a CellSpot Wi-Fi router that lets customers make Wi-Fi calls and text in areas beyond cell coverage. More than 1 million of the routers are currently in circulation; T-Mobile customers are making more than 11 million Wi-Fi calls daily, the company says. T-Mobile also offers customers a 4G LTE CellSpot Signal Booster. That raises the question of where the new 4G LTE CellSpot box fits in, especially if you can already use a router to make Wi-Fi calls. T-Mobile says that LTE is often faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi, and that the new box is compatible with the latest network technologies, including HD Calling, VoLTE (Voice over LTE), advanced messaging, and video calling. And once installed, T-Mobile's chief operating officer Mike Sievert said in an interview that \\"customers have to do absolutely nothing to make it work.\\" Today's announcement comes ahead of T-Mobile's next big \\"Un-carrier\\" promotional event, scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on Nov 10. Though T-Mobile hasn't said what next week will bring, the speculation is that the company might let you use popular streaming video services--perhaps, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, and so on—without having it count against your monthly data usage. T-Mobile already does this with many popular music services. Sievert wouldn't spill the beans ahead of time. Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY personal tech columnist @edbaig on Twitter Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Mtc0yJ ||||| Customers browse in a T-Mobile store in Budapest on Monday. (Akos Stiller/Bloomberg) T-Mobile has begun giving out miniature cell towers to customers in an attempt to create little hotspots of LTE where the carrier's network is weak or nonexistent. The devices, which cost little more than a 25 refundable deposit, are being promoted to homes and small businesses and can connect any T-Mobile customer's smartphone to mobile data, including 3G and 4G. The company says they can cover a range of 3,000 square feet. So should you get one? In some individual circumstances, maybe, but for the vast majority of consumers, you might be better off using plain, old, boring WiFi. Here's why. T-Mobile's CellSpot doesn't provide an Internet connection all by itself. It has to be plugged into an existing wired broadband connection, the kind of service you might buy from Comcast or Verizon. That requirement ultimately makes the CellSpot impractical for many consumers. Think about your current home Internet provider. Chances are, the company included a WiFi router with your installation, and if it didn't, you likely went out and bought your own. Not only does the CellSpot effectively duplicate an Internet access technology already present in many people's homes — it comes with other drawbacks. The CellSpot's data speeds are only as fast as your fixed broadband connection, so it's not as though you can plug the device into a 10 Mbps service and suddenly be surfing at 60 Mbps. \\"Imagine putting a race car in rush hour traffic in the scenario you describe,\\" said Joel Rushing, a T-Mobile spokesperson. What's more, using the CellSpot drains your T-Mobile data plan, whereas surfing on WiFi is completely free (except in places where wired Internet providers have implemented data caps themselves). If any other T-Mobile customers happen to be nearby, their devices can link to the CellSpot, too. Giving out access to T-Mobile's network might be nice when you've invited guests over. But then again, why not just give them access to your home WiFi network? If you're not interested in broadcasting LTE beyond your apartment or other small space, Rushing said, the T-Mobile Personal CellSpot Router might be a better choice. It's basically a regular WiFi router that happens to be optimized to handle T-Mobile's WiFi calling features. But again, with that choice you'd be going back to WiFi. Any households that might be thinking of getting an LTE CellSpot from T-Mobile will need to consider a few things: Does being on T-Mobile's network matter more to you than being on WiFi? Compared to the LTE CellSpot, WiFi costs nothing to surf, supports faster speeds, and you have more control over it (through your router's settings, whereas you can't set a password on the LTE CellSpot). ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The T-Mobile 4G LTE CellSpot is a small box that you can plug into your Internet router at home or in your office. It helps make your cellphone signal stronger inside your house, especially in places where the signal might not be very good. It is like having a mini cellphone tower inside your home. T-Mobile gives these CellSpots to some of their customers for free, but you have to leave a 25 deposit and stay as their customer. This can help people who live in areas where T-Mobile's signal isn't as strong as other cellphone companies. However, it uses your T-Mobile data plan, so using it instead of Wi-Fi could use up your monthly data allowance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again?, using the article: Released in September 1980, Never for Ever saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first experience as a producer was on her Live on Stage EP, released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on Never for Ever is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker \\"Violin\\" to the wistful waltz of hit single \\"Army Dreamers\\". Never for Ever was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on Peter Gabriel's eponymous third album in early 1980. It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status, and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top. The top-selling single from the album was \\"Babooshka\\", which reached number five in the UK singles chart. In November 1980, she released the standalone Christmas single \\"December Will Be Magic Again\\", which reached number 29 in the UK charts. September 1982 saw the release of The Dreaming, the first album Bush produced by herself. With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. The Dreaming received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become \\"less accessible\\". In a 1993 interview with Q (magazine), Bush stated: \\"That was my 'She's gone mad' album.\\" However, the album became her first to enter the US Billboard 200 chart, albeit only reaching number 157.

Movie plot title: The Bourne Identity Movie plot: In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian fishermen rescue an unconscious American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, and when the man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages.

Arriving at the bank, the man finds the box contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use the name on the American passport, Jason Bourne. After Bourne's departure, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. Treadstone's head, Alexander Conklin (Chris Cooper), activates three agents to take down Bourne: Castel (Nicky Naude), Manheim (Russell Levy), and the Professor (Clive Owen), while also issuing alerts to local police to capture Bourne. Meanwhile, CIA Deputy Director Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) contacts Conklin about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Conklin promises Abbott that he will deal with the Treadstone agent who failed.

Question: This article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car.

Choices: - nucleus - molecule - neutron - atom A:","completion":"A: Atom John Dalton, an English chemist, physicist, and meteorologist, proposed the atomic theory in the early 19th century. This theory was based on the idea that all matter is composed of indivisible, fundamental particles called atoms—from the Greek word \\"atomos,\\" meaning \\"indivisible,\\" or \\"uncut.\\" Dalton's atomic theory was a significant development in the history of chemistry and laid the foundation for our modern understanding of matter. Before Dalton, ancient philosophers like Democritus and Leucippus had also proposed the idea of atoms. However, their work was more philosophical in nature and did not have significant experimental evidence to support their claims. Dalton's theory, on the other hand, combined experimental results with philosophical interpretations, ultimately leading to a more accurate and scientific understanding of matter. According to Dalton's atomic theory: 1. All matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. 2. Atoms of the same element are identical in mass and chemical properties, while atoms of different elements have different masses and distinct chemical properties. 3. Atoms cannot be created or destroyed during a chemical reaction. They can only be rearranged to form new compounds. 4. Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in fixed, whole-number ratios. At that time in history, it was believed that atoms were the smallest particles of matter. The discovery of subatomic particles like protons, neutrons, and electrons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries showed that atoms could be further divided into smaller, constituent particles, ultimately disproving the idea that atoms were the smallest possible unit of matter. Through various experiments, scientists discovered the nature and structure of these subatomic particles. The nucleus, a central, positively charged core within the atom, was found to be composed of protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge). Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, orbit around the nucleus in specific energy levels. Despite these discoveries, Dalton's atomic theory still remains a vital foundation for our current understanding of chemistry and the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Almost as if they were all written separately without any editing to tie them all together.Information is presented in something less than an interesting manner - it's pretty dry! Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The given review can be categorized as negative. To provide a comprehensive analysis of the review, let's break it down into its key components and assess the critical feedback provided. 1. \\"Chapters are disjoint at times, with no reference to similar concepts between them\\": This statement suggests that the reader found the organization of the text to be lacking in coherence. The chapters appear unrelated, making it difficult for the reader to comprehend how the different concepts are interconnected. This disjointed structure may hinder the user's ability to fully grasp the content, leading to an unsatisfactory reading experience. 2. \\"Almost as if they were all written separately without any editing to tie them all together\\": This observation conveys the idea that the text might be poorly edited, giving an impression of a fragmented collection rather than a well-structured, cohesive work. Proper editing plays a critical role in ensuring a smooth flow of thoughts and ideas. Failing to do so can result in a confusing and challenging text for the reader, which contributes to a negative review. 3. \\"Information is presented in something less than an interesting manner - it's pretty dry!\\": This comment highlights that the presentation of the content is not engaging, and the reader found it dull. A compelling and captivating writing style is essential to maintain the reader's interest and evoke enthusiasm for the subject matter. When the text fails to deliver in this area, it can deter the reader from fully appreciating the content, resulting in an unfavorable perception. In conclusion, the review is negative due to the points raised about the disjointed chapters, lack of proper editing, and the uninteresting presentation of information. The reader's experience with the text has been compromised by these shortcomings, which has led to a negative evaluation of the overall quality and appeal of the work."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the following article and select the best answer.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What position was held by the man that Bach served as Kappelmeister for?, using the article: As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach were performed in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131 (a psalm setting), and the Easter chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. He was promoted to Konzertmeister on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the Schlosskirche. The first cantatas he composed in the new position were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12 for Jubilate Sunday, and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, BWV 172, for Pentecost. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, Salomo Franck, they contain recitatives and arias. When Johann Samuel Drese, the Kapellmeister (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as Kapellmeister at the court of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.In Köthen, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was Calvinist, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the orchestral suites, the cello suites, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV..., what would be the answer ?

I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

Rodriguez moved to the Dominican Republic with her mother when she was eight years old and lived there until age 11. Later, she moved to Puerto Rico until the age of 17, and finally settled in Jersey City, New Jersey. In March 2002, Rodriguez was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with her roommate, but charges were later dropped after the roommate declined to press the allegations in court. In November 2003, Rodriguez went to court to face eight misdemeanor charges based on two driving incidents including a hit and run and driving under the influence (DUI). In June 2004, Rodriguez pleaded no contest in Los Angeles to three of the charges: hit and run, drunken driving, and driving with a suspended license. She went to jail for 48 hours, performed community service at the morgues of two New York hospitals, completed a three-month alcohol program, and was placed on probation for three years. In 2005, while filming Lost in Hawaii, Rodriguez was pulled over by Honolulu police multiple times for speeding violations and on December 1 she was arrested for DUI. In April 2006, she pleaded guilty to one charge of driving under the influence and chose to pay a US500 fine and spend five days in jail. She cited her high doses of allergy-relieving steroids as part of the reason for her erratic behavior. Because the incident was a violation of her Los Angeles probation, she was sentenced to 60 days in jail, a 30-day alcohol rehabilitation program and another 30 days of community service, including work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

In its original sense, the word specifically denoted a full suit of armor, but it has since evolved to encompass a wider range of meanings. The Russian word \\"паноплия\\" similarly carries these meanings. It can be used to describe an extensive assortment of objects or an impressive display of something. For example, one could say that a well-stocked library contains a panoply of books (or \\"паноплия книг\\" in Russian), highlighting the wide range of literary works available in the library. Alternatively, an art gallery featuring a diverse collection of paintings and sculptures can be described as exhibiting a panoply of art forms (or \\"паноплия художественных форм\\" in Russian). The word \\"паноплия\\" can also be encountered in historical contexts, where it refers to full suits of armor worn in ancient times. In these cases, the word \\"паноплия\\" similarly depicts a full and striking assemblage of elements coming together as a functional and visually impressive whole. It's crucial to remember that when translating words or phrases, the specific context in which they are used plays a significant role in determining the most accurate translation.

Information: - Forage fish, also called prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include particularly fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right. - Triticale ( × Triticosecale ) , / trtkeli / is a hybrid of wheat ( Triticum ) and rye ( Secale ) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second - generation hybrid , i.e. , a cross between two kinds of primary ( first - cross ) triticales . As a rule , triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance ( including soil conditions ) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop . Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents . It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale - based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye , wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent ( pollen donor ) . The resulting hybrid is sterile and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself . The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009 , according to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world . The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words , triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years , most work was done on octoploid triticale . Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time . The tetraploids showed little promise , but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application . The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products , such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is... - A cereal is any grass cultivated for the edible components of its grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), composed of the endosperm, germ, and bran. Cereal grains are grown in greater quantities and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop and are therefore staple crops. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat (Polygonaceae), quinoa (Amaranthaceae) and chia (Lamiaceae), are referred to as pseudocereals. - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering. - Hay is grass, legumes, or other herbaceous plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use as animal fodder, particularly for grazing animals such as cattle, horses, goats, and sheep. Hay is also fed to smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Pigs may be fed hay, but they do not digest it as efficiently as more fully herbivorous animals. - Rice is the seed of the grass species \\"Oryza sativa\\" (Asian rice) or \\"Oryza glaberrima\\" (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture. Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,20013,500 years ago in the Pearl River valley region of Ancient China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. - Silage is fermented, high-moisture stored fodder which can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals) or used as a biofuel feedstock for anaerobic digesters. It is fermented and stored in a process called \\"ensilage\\", \\"ensiling\\" or \\"silaging\\", and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type (\\"oatlage\\" for oats, \\"haylage\\" for alfalfa but see below for the different British use of the term \\"haylage\\"). - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes. - Rye (\\"Secale cereale\\") is a grass grown extensively as a grain, a cover crop and a forage crop. It is a member of the wheat tribe (Triticeae) and is closely related to barley (genus \\"Hordeum\\") and wheat (\\"Triticum\\"). Rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, some whiskeys, some vodkas, and animal fodder. It can also be eaten whole, either as boiled rye berries or by being rolled, similar to rolled oats. - Barley (\\"Hordeum vulgare\\" L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 13,000 years ago. Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses includes genera with many domesticated species. Major crop genera found in this tribe include wheat (See Wheat taxonomy), barley, and rye; crops in other genera include some for human consumption and others used for animal feed or rangeland protection. Among the world's cultivated species, this tribe has some of the most complex genetic histories. An example is bread wheat, which contains the genomes of three species, only one of them originally a wheat \\"Triticum\\" species. Seed storage proteins in the Triticeae are implicated in various food allergies and intolerances. - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - GRAIN (initially the International Coalition for Development Action or ICDA) is a small international non-profit organisation that works to support small farmers and social movements in their struggles for community-controlled and biodiversity-based food systems. - The chicken (\\"Gallus gallus domesticus\\") is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. - Frankfurt am Main is a metropolis and the largest city in the German state of Hesse and the fifth-largest city in Germany, with a 2015 population of 731,095 within its administrative boundaries, and 2.3 million in its urban area. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region, which has a population of 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after Rhine-Ruhr. Since the enlargement of the European Union in 2013, the geographic centre of the EU is about to the east of Frankfurt's CBD, the Bankenviertel. Frankfurt is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a migration background. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many expatriates. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Fodder, a type of animal feed, is any agricultural foodstuff used specifically to feed domesticated livestock, such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, chickens and pigs. \\"Fodder\\" refers particularly to food given to the animals (including plants cut and carried to them), rather than that which they forage for themselves (called forage). Fodder is also called provender and includes hay, straw, silage, compressed and pelleted feeds, oils and mixed rations, and sprouted grains and legumes (such as bean sprouts, fresh malt, or spent malt). Most animal feed is from plants, but some manufacturers add ingredients to processed feeds that are of animal origin. - There are two types of agricultural crop residues. Field residues are materials left in an agricultural field or orchard after the crop has been harvested. These residues include stalks and stubble (stems), leaves, and seed pods. The residue can be ploughed directly into the ground, or burned first. Good management of field residues can increase efficiency of irrigation and control of erosion. Process residues are materials left after the crop is processed into a usable resource. These residues include husks, seeds, bagasse, molasses and roots. They can be used as animal fodder and soil amendment, fertilizers and in manufacturing. - Stuttgart ( Swabian: \\"Schduagert\\"), often nicknamed the \\"\\"Schwabenmetropole\\"\\" in reference to its location in the center of Swabia and the local dialect spoken by some natives, is the capital and largest city of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. It is located on the Neckar river in a fertile valley locally known as the \\"Stuttgarter Kessel\\" an hour from the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest. Stuttgart's name comes from the Old High German word \\"\\"Stuogarten\\",\\" or \\"stud farm\\" a reference to the city's founding in 950 AD as a stud farm. Stuttgarts urban area has a population of 623,738, and a further making it the sixth largest city in Germany, 2.7 million people live in the citys administrative region, and another 5.3 million people in its metropolitan area, making it the fourth largest metropolitan area in Germany. - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\". - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish). - Wheat (\\"Triticum\\" spp., most commonly \\"T. aestivum\\") is a cereal grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis), originally from the Levant region but now cultivated worldwide. In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize (1.03 billion tonnes), with more than rice (499 million tonnes). Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st Century. - Animal feed is food given to domestic animals in the course of animal husbandry. There are two basic types, \\"fodder\\" and \\"forage\\". Used alone, the word \\"feed\\" more often refers to fodder. - Hamburg (local pronunciation ; Low German/Low Saxon: \\"Hamborg\\" ), officially \\"Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg\\" (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union. It is the second smallest German state by area. Its population is over 1.7 million people, and the wider Hamburg Metropolitan Region covers more than 5.1 million inhabitants. The city is situated on the river Elbe. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles. - The Levant (Arabic: \\"\\") is an approximate historical geographical term referring to a large area in the Eastern Mediterranean. In its widest historical sense, the Levant included all of the eastern Mediterranean with its islands, that is, it included all of the countries along the Eastern Mediterranean shores, extending from Greece to Cyrenaica. The term \\"Levant\\" entered English in the late 15th century from French. It derives from the Italian \\"Levante\\", meaning \\"rising\\", implying the rising of the sun in the east. As such, it is broadly equivalent to the Arabic term \\"Mashriq\\", meaning \\"the land where the sun rises\\". - A legume (or ) is a plant or its fruit or seed in the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae). Legumes are grown agriculturally, primarily for their grain seed called pulse, for livestock forage and silage, and as soil-enhancing green manure. Well-known legumes include alfalfa, clover, peas, beans, lentils, lupin bean, mesquite, carob, soybeans, peanuts and tamarind. \\"Fabaceae\\" is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa. - Biodiversity, a contraction of \\"biological diversity,\\" generally refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future. What is the relationship between 'triticale' and 'pooideae'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Triticale (x Triticosecale) is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale), both of which belong to the tribe Triticeae within the subfamily Pooideae of grasses.

Summarize this article in one sentence. \\"Free\\" current accounts - described by one academic as a \\"brilliant marketing ploy\\" - are often the most expensive option. One consumer group has called for banks to be fined over the complexity of charges. However, an inquiry has given the sector a relatively clean bill of health. Many banks are engaged in financial charm offensive with potential customers, offering upfront cash incentives with new accounts which are more generous than the annual interest paid on many savings accounts. Consumers appear to be giving them the cold-shoulder in return and sticking with \\"free\\" accounts. A switching rate of less than 2% last year was even lower than the previous 12 months. So why are customers unwilling to move their money and what is the benefit for the banks? How can customers understand and make the most of their banking services? Will new technology offer banking at better value for money? Ahead of the UK competition authority's final plan to fix frailties in the market, the BBC News website is examining the personal current account sector in a series of articles to be published over the next few days. 97% of UK adults hold one Less than 2% switched in 2015 £177: banks' annual revenue per customer £???: banks' cost per customer unknown There are 68 million current accounts which are active in the UK. They are being used by 97% of adults in the country - a bigger proportion, for example, than have a gas supply. Of these, three-quarters have a so-called \\"free-if-in-credit\\" account. Customers pay no monthly or annual fee, but they forgo a chunk of interest payments and may face a host of charges ranging from fees for going overdrawn to making purchases in foreign currency. Current accounts are \\"essential for modern life\\", according to John Ashton, professor of banking at Bangor University Business School, but the effect of this \\"free\\" model is that those with the lowest and highest amounts in accounts subsidise those in the middle. The poorest \\"bore the burden of overdraft costs\\". Middle income customers occasionally went into the red, but also tended to hold larger deposits in current accounts, for which they were missing out on interest payments they could have won elsewhere, he said. Overdraft fees have been overhauled by banks since this research - in which Prof Ashton analysed 17 years of current account data to 2011 with Professor Robert Hudson, of the University of Hull. Yet, the fundamental issue was unchanged, Prof Ashton told the BBC. \\"Over the long-term [free-if-in-credit] has not been a cheap way of getting banking services,\\" he said. \\"As a marketing ploy, it is brilliant.\\" Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the influential Treasury select committee of MPs, went further - describing free banking as \\"not just misleading, it is a con-trick\\". \\"There is no such thing as free banking. The consumer, in my view, should have an opportunity to find out how much they are paying, as they expect to do with any other good and service,\\" he told the BBC News website. A recent report into the retail banking market by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) revealed that the banks' average revenue from each current account customer was £177 in a year. To the obvious frustration of the Treasury committee, the CMA failed to unearth the average cost per customer of providing these current accounts. \\"They [the banks] think about the value of customers over their lifetime, rather than the profitability of individual customers,\\" Alasdair Smith, chairman of the CMA, told the committee at a recent hearing. Mr Tyrie and his committee told the CMA that they should have delved deeper during their investigation. \\"If banks do not know who they are making money from, this only serves to reinforce the fact that there is not enough competition in the market,\\" Mr Tyrie told the BBC. \\"In other industries, businesses which do not know where they are making money do not last very long. [Bank account price] is not as straightforward as a can of soup, but it is not beyond the wit of man. \\"Customers are not given the opportunity to choose [between accounts] on the basis of price.\\" How to leave your bank ... in 60 seconds The bank switching plan explained Banking apps: What are they and how do they work? An account's value for money - if this is possible to calculate - depends on which services a customer uses and how much he or she is charged for those services. For example, a list of current account fees provided to the BBC by financial information service Moneyfacts reveals the type of charges often ignored by customers choosing an account. For example, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (Chaps) is used for high-value payments made within a day. The fee for making a £100 payment through this system ranges from £12 to £40 with different accounts. James Daley, managing director of consumer website Fairer Finance, said the most common charges for going into the red were almost impossible to compare. \\"One of the main problems for bank customers today is that every bank has a different way of charging for overdrafts. Some have daily fees, some charge interest rates, some have buffers - and so it goes on,\\" he said. \\"If you are unlucky enough to go beyond your overdraft limit, things can be worse still. Some banks have 'returned item fees', some have 'unplanned borrowing charges', some have 'unpaid transaction fees'. Most of this means nothing to the average customer. \\"Outside of overdrafts, jargon is at its worst. There are 'load' fees and 'non-sterling transaction charges' for using your card abroad, as well as fees for Chaps, Swift, Target and Sepa payments. \\"Banks seem to revel in blinding their customers with complex language and jargon. Given that the FCA's rulebook already stipulates that customer communications need to be 'clear, fair and not misleading', we think most banks are in breach of the regulations. \\"It is time for the regulator to start making an example of the worst offenders and even fining them.\\" The British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the UK's major High Street banks, said: \\"The industry has clear guidelines that covers the need for banks to communicate in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading. \\"The banking industry is very much in favour of competition and actively encourages customers to shop around to get the best deals. Over the past five years, banks have introduced a number of different services to help customers keep on top of their money and compare offers so they can make informed choices and switch if appropriate. \\"To give just a few examples of this commitment, customers can now see itemised charges on bank statements, over 1.3 million text alerts from banks are sent to customers each week. Customers are also provided with annual summaries and breakdowns of charges taken to help comparisons.\\" Thursday: How to get the most from your current account Summary:","completion":"Many people are using \\"free\\" current accounts, which are often the most expensive banking option, due to the complexity of charges and a lack of understanding of the banking system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who was president during the bay of pigs invasion?","completion":"John Fitzgerald Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was the president of the United States during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. JFK was the 35th president, serving from January 20, 1961, until his assassination on November 22, 1963. He was a member of the Democratic Party and was the youngest president ever elected to office at the age of 43. The Bay of Pigs Invasion, also known as \\"La Batalla de Giron\\" in Cuba or \\"Operación Pluto\\" in the United States, took place between April 17th and April 19th, 1961. This unsuccessful military intervention in Cuba was a covert operation initiated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during JFK's administration, with the objective of overthrowing the communist government of Fidel Castro. While Kennedy was not the architect of the invasion plan, it proceeded under his watch, and he shouldered the blame for its failure. The roots of this invasion plan can be traced back to the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The United States had grown increasingly concerned with Castro's close ties to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism in the Western Hemisphere, prompting Eisenhower to approve a plan in March 1960 to train Cuban exiles for an armed invasion of Cuba. When Kennedy assumed presidency, he allowed the plan to go forward, albeit with some modifications. The operation involved the CIA training and equipping a group of approximately 1,400 Cuban exiles (known as Brigade 2506) in Guatemala. These exiles were trained in various aspects of unconventional warfare. Their mission was to create initial beachheads in the southern coast of Cuba, specifically at the Bay of Pigs area in the Zapata Swamp region. From there, they were supposed to capture key targets, rally anti-Castro forces, and form a provisional government that would take control of the island. The invasion was a disaster from the outset. The operation faced a series of logistical and intelligence failures. Cuban forces had been alerted to the impending attack, and JFK's administration had scaled back air support, allowing the Cuban Air Force to maintain air superiority. Additionally, the amphibious landing site chosen for the invasion proved to be poorly suited, as it was surrounded by swampy terrain, providing no easy escape routes for the invading forces. As a result, the invading forces faced fierce resistance from Cuban troops, who easily repelled the invasion. Within three days, the members of Brigade 2506 were either killed or captured, with over 100 killed and over 1,000 taken as prisoners. The failed invasion led to further deterioration of US-Cuban relations and heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. President Kennedy accepted responsibility for the failure, stating in a press conference that \\"victory has a hundred fathers, but defeat is an orphan.\\" The Bay of Pigs Invasion had a significant impact on Kennedy's domestic and foreign policy. It led to increased distrust towards the CIA, and Kennedy reevaluated the role of military advisors in his administration. Despite the failure at the Bay of Pigs, JFK remained committed to containing the spread of communism, and it resulted in decisions like supporting the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade and increasing involvement in the Vietnam War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What happened between Ron and Veronica? Movie plot title: Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Movie plot: In the mid 1970's, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is the famous and successful anchorman for San Diego's KVWN-TV Channel 4 Evening News. He works alongside his friends on the news team: fashion-oriented lead field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sportscaster Champion \\"Champ\\" Kind (David Koechner), and a \\"legally retarded\\" chief meteorologist Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The team is notified by their boss, Ed Harken (Fred Willard), that their station has maintained its long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party. Ron sees an attractive blond woman and immediately tries to hit on her. After an awkward, failed pick-up attempt, the woman leaves.The next day, Ed informs the team that he has been forced by the network to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate), a female news reporter from Asheville, North Carolina and the same woman Ron had tried to pick up the night before. The news team attempts to seduce Veronica using various inept, arrogant and sexist methods, all of which backfire. Ron ends up asking her out under the guise of helping out a new co-worker, which she accepts. During their date, Ron woos Veronica by playing jazz flute in his friend Tino's (Fred Armisen) club. Veronica goes against her policy of not dating co-workers and sleeps with Ron. The next day, despite agreeing with Veronica to keep the relationship discreet, Ron tells the entire news room that he and Veronica are in a sexual relationship (and later announces it on the air).The next day when Ron is on his way to the station, he throws a burrito out his car window, accidentally hitting a motorcyclist (Jack Black) in the head, causing him to crash. In a fit of rage, the biker retaliates by punting Ron's dog, Baxter, off a bridge. A distressed and incoherent Ron calls Brian from a pay phone and tells him what happened. Since Ron is now late, Brian frantically tells him to come to the station because Veronica is about to take his place. Despite Ron's efforts to arrive on time,... Answer:","completion":"Between Ron and Veronica, initially, there was an awkward encounter during a party when Ron unsuccessfully attempted to hit on Veronica. Later, they met again in the workplace when Veronica was hired as a female news reporter for the same news program where Ron worked. Despite the rest of the news team using sexist tactics to seduce Veronica and Ron's initial reluctance to get involved with a coworker, he asked her out under the guise of helping her settle in. On their date, Ron played jazz flute at his friend Tino's club, which led to Veronica breaking her policy of not dating coworkers, and she ended up sleeping with Ron. The next day, although they agreed to keep their relationship discreet, Ron boasted about their sexual relationship both to the newsroom and on the air. Thus, at the beginning of their work relationship, the two shared an unsuccessful first impression, developed a romantic relationship after their first date, and faced the challenge of maintaining discretion as coworkers. As time went on, Ron's egocentric behavior and inability to respect the relationship resulted in a strain between them. Additionally, Ron's tardiness in reaching the news station resulted in Veronica having to fill in for him during a live broadcast. This led to her gaining increased recognition amongst the viewers and further challenging the dynamic between the two, as Ron was not used to sharing the limelight with Veronica. In summary, the relationship between Ron and Veronica began with an unsuccessful first impression, developed into a romantic relationship, and was eventually challenged by Ron's egotism and the changing power dynamics at their work."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gun owner? Yes, Eleanor Roosevelt, known for traveling the country to highlight the plight of the poor and marginalized, also was packing heat. The mother of five had a .22 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol with a 6-inch barrel, front sight and a round top frame with an adjustable rear sight. Her application for a pistol permit in Dutchess County was added in June to the extensive materials on Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park. Bob Clark, acting director of the library and museum, said the pistol permit application is extremely important from a historical perspective. “This is an example of a record that is out there — it was intended for an administrative purpose, but it has long-term, historical implications,” Clark said. “It’s very important that it has a permanent home here at the library.” With debate raging in New York and around the nation about gun control and Second Amendment rights, the fact that one of the greats of the Democratic Party not only owned a gun, but carried it for protection, may seem hard to believe, but it was a different time, some say. Eleanor Roosevelt received death threats and her husband, Franklin Roosevelt, had survived an assassination attempt in Miami while awaiting his first presidential inauguration. The Roosevelts had been in the political spotlight for years. For example, FDR was governor of New York from 1928-32. But the spotlight would only get brighter. Franklin Roosevelt had won his first presidential election in 1932 and he would win three more terms as president. That assassination attempt in February 1933 prompted FDR to suggest to his wife that she let the Secret Service protect her. She declined. According to Clark, Eleanor Roosevelt did not like to have a large entourage and preferred to travel alone. But in October 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt received a gift or her 49th birthday from her bodyguard, Earl Miller. “Her bodyguard, Earl Miller, wanted to teach her how to shoot a gun so she would have that skill, if necessary,” Clark said. “He worked with her to show her the proper way to shoot a pistol and that was really the beginning of Mrs. Roosevelt’s interest with handguns.” According to James D. Julia Auctioneers in Maine, Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol was sold at auction in October 2014 to a private collector for 50,600. “I think it's fascinating,” said Jeremy Levenbach, 33, of Brooklyn, who on Friday visited the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park. Political divide Eleanor Roosevelt is considered a 20th century icon of the Democratic Party and someone whose liberal politics established an enduring benchmark that continues to shape politics today. The fact that she owned a gun offers yet another dimension to the historic legacy of a president and first lady who were based in Dutchess County but shaped national and global events. Viewed from the perspective of 21st century politics, where Republicans and Democrats largely have lined up on opposing sides of the gun control debate, Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol offers a fresh take on the ongoing debate over the rights of gun owners, the Democrats who want to curtail them and the Republicans who want to expand them. “I think that having an icon in the political arena and, truly, someone who was a world leader, having a true understanding of what your Second Amendment rights are, as an American, is just incredibly enlightening,” said Mike McCormack, chairman of the Dutchess County Republican Committee. “She got it.” Dutchess County Democratic Committee Chairwoman Elisa Sumner had a very different opinion. “I don’t think you can compare what she did in 1957 with 2015,” Sumner said. “At the time, you weren’t having mass shootings. You didn’t have Sandy Hook (elementary school shootings). You didn’t have people walking around with semi-automatic weapons, Uzis and Kalishnikovs. I don’t think there is a comparison at all. You’re talking about two different time periods. “She needed protection because of her liberal, civil rights circumstances. She needed protection,” Sumner said. Levenbach shared Sumner’s opinion. “I think it was such a different time,” he said. Eleanor's travels In 1937, Eleanor Roosevelt traveled to New Orleans and was provided with security, Clark said. She didn’t feel the security was necessary when she traveled in New York or Washington, because people knew who she was. “She made a comment at that event,” Clark said. “She made an off-handed comment that she sometimes did carry a gun when she traveled and she knew how to use it. She also made the comment, ‘I hate guns.’” Eleanor Roosevelt carried the unloaded gun in the locked glove compartment of her car. Clark said the story picks up again in 1957. That’s the year Eleanor Roosevelt applied for and received a pistol permit in Dutchess County. She was 72. The permit was among the items in Eleanor Roosevelt’s wallet when she died on Nov. 7, 1962. The date on the pistol permit was Aug. 5, 1957. Her address on the permit is listed as “ValKill Cottage, Hyde Park.” Her occupation is listed as “Writer & Lecturer.” She wrote that she was employed by “Self.” The permit is on display at the library. Dutchess County Clerk Brad Kendall, 51 years after the permit was issued, was attending the annual meeting of the New York State Association of County Clerks. As was customary, a representative of the state police addressed those gathered. In 2008, the discussion turned to pistol permits and how the deaths of permit holders can make the the accuracy of the state’s database difficult to maintain. The speaker, as an example, cited how Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol permit, in 2008, remained active. Kendall returned home and found the application. “Sure enough, we had it,” he said. “It had never been noted she was deceased. Technically, it was still active.” Eleanor Roosevelt’s pistol application indicated that she had previously been granted a pistol license in 1933. No further information was available. But along with the application Kendall found was a document with Eleanor Roosevelt’s fingerprints. Eleanor Roosevelt's fingerprints, from her 1957 pistol application. (Photo: Courtesy/FDR Presidential Library) The application had been processed by the Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office and signed by then-Sheriff C. Fred Close. It included a photo of Eleanor Roosevelt wearing a hat, fur stole and double strand of pearls. The reason for the pistol, according to Eleanor Roosevelt’s application, was “protection.” Clark said the timing of the pistol permit coincided with Eleanor Roosevelt’s travels throughout the South — by herself — in advocacy of civil rights. Those trips prompted death threats. The photograph of Eleanor Roosevelt that accompanied her 1957 pistol permit application. (Photo: Courtesy photo/FDR Presidential Library) After the application was discovered at the county clerk’s office, it was returned to long-term storage, Kendall said. Earlier this year, older pistol permits were purged and, after consulting with the county historian and New York State Archives, Kendall turned the application over to the FDR Library. The formal transfer took place in June during a naturalization ceremony that Kendall conducted at the FDR Library’s Henry A. Wallace Visitor and Education Center. The pistol permit application is not on display, but available for review by researchers. John W.

Now the portrait photographer who lives in Boca Raton wants to see that photo on the 10 bill. Her picture is in the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, N.Y., and Roosevelt is on the short list of contenders for a woman on the note. \\"It would be a wonderful tribute to a wonderful woman,\\" Kapp wrote in her April 15 letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew with a package documenting her request. No answer yet, but Congresswoman Lois Frankel carried her wishes to Washington, her staff confirmed. But there's more to the story. The often-photographed Roosevelt liked the picture so much she asked for more copies that Kapp delivered herself. At that auspicious visit, Roosevelt offered to pay for the prints, but for Kapp it was an unexpected payback. \\"I could never in my wildest dreams have thought this would happen to me,\\" she wrote. \\"I was on the last children's transport from Danzig, Germany [to England] in May, 1939,\\" narrowly escaping Hitler's Holocaust. \\"One day we were all given new shoes…and when I opened mine, the paper read: With all good wishes, Eleanor Roosevelt, American Rescue Committee. \\"I was able to reciprocate in a small way,\\" she said, recalling that \\"Roosevelt was absolutely astounded....\\" Once she was older but still living in England to wait out the war, Kapp apprenticed with \\"one of the best photo studios.\\" She was reunited years later with her brother and parents who escaped on a ship and ended up in a British internment camp. The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum put all the letters between them and photographs in two huge binders that Kapp keeps to document the family's survival. By the time the Roosevelt photo came up it was 20 years later. She had married William S. Kapp in 1949 and kept working in her studio and shot portraits, mostly children and including baseball great Jackie Robinson and his family. In a Nov. 10, 1959 letter, Roosevelt thanked Kapp for the photo taken on Oct. 25 during a Democratic campaign stop for Adlai Stevenson, who wasn't there, at Livingston High School. Roosevelt offered to autograph the photo and invited Kapp to pick it up at her Val-Kill Cottage in Hyde Park. \\"She called me from Hyde Park and I was in my dark room,\\" Kapp remembers. That was quickly followed by two more letters asking for more copies, and extending an invitation to her East Side Manhattan apartment on 74th Street. Kapp decided to go and bring her mother-in-law, the artist Paula Kapp. \\"I couldn't believe it myself,\\" she said. Afterward, she got a handwritten thank-you note from Roosevelt dated Jan. 21, 1960. \\"If I ever need a photographer, I will certainly get in touch with you,\\" she wrote. There's no date set for deciding on which woman will replace Alexander Hamilton on the 10 bill, if in fact he is replaced. \\"Treasury will engage the public during the summer to hear from the American people and engage in a public dialogue about currency designs that best represent the value of democracy,\\" according to the department. \\"After reviewing this input, the Secretary will announce his decision for the portrait; however no date has been set. The only criterion for a portrait selected for currency is that the person must be deceased.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This news article is about Eleanor Roosevelt, a famous lady who was married to a very important person named Franklin D. Roosevelt. She did many great things to help people who were poor and not treated well. The article tells us that Eleanor Roosevelt owned a special kind of tool called a pistol, which is a small type of gun. She used the pistol to protect herself because sometimes people would say mean things and maybe want to hurt her. A long time ago, she got a paper called a pistol permit that allowed her to own the pistol. Nowadays, people talk about whether it's okay for everyone to have guns, so the story about Eleanor owning one is considered really interesting by some people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Meat Beat Manifesto, often shortened as Meat Beat, Manifesto or MBM, is an electronic music group originally consisting of Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens, and formed in 1987 in Swindon, United Kingdom. The band, fronted by Dangers (the only permanent member), has proven versatile over the years, experimenting with techno, dubstep, drum and bass, IDM, industrial, dub and jazz fusion while touring the world and influencing major acts such as Nine Inch Nails, The Chemical Brothers and The Prodigy. Some of the band's earlier work has been credited with influencing the rise of the trip hop, big beat, and drum and bass genres. Dangers and Stephens had formed the English pop group Perennial Divide in 1986 with Paul Freeguard and released the first few Meat Beat Manifesto singles as a side project. They left Perennial Divide in 1988 to record a full Meat Beat album. The tapes of what would have been the debut MBM album were claimed to have been destroyed in a studio fire before it could be released (detailed in a publicity statement). The former founder of Sweat Box Records (Rob Deacon) said that the fire never happened. Jack Dangers confirmed the story of the fire in a 2010 interview. The pair then recorded the LP Storm The Studio, which got them pigeonholed as an industrial act because Sweat Box Records sold the rights to the LP to Wax Trax Records for release in the United States. In response, they released 99%, which was more techno-influenced, in May 1990. In August they released Armed Audio Warfare, which was an effort to re-create the lost tracks of the would-be debut album. The band's live show was conceived as an intense audio-visual experience, with dancers, led by choreographer Marcus Adams, in costumes and sets designed by artist Craig Morrison and video clips accompanying live instruments, sequenced electronic instruments, and live DJing. In the United States, they opened for Nine Inch Nails on their debut national tour in 1990. In 1991, they performed at The Limelight in Manhattan. Despite his contributions being nonmusical in nature, Adams was credited as a full band member and appeared in many of the band's record sleeves and promo photos until the release of Satyricon in 1992. Adams also appeared in several of MBM's early videos, such as \\"Strapdown\\" and \\"Psyche-Out\\". 1992's Satyricon continued to show Meat Beat adopting a more mainstream electronic sound, crediting influences of such newly popular dance bands as Orbital, The Shamen, and The Orb, all of whom had either remixed or been remixed by MBM. The album produced the hits \\"Mindstream\\" and \\"Circles\\". \\"Original Control (Version 2)\\", renamed \\"I Am Electro\\" in later compilations, is the best-known track from the album, featuring samples of recordings from the 1939 World's Fair exhibit Elektro The Robot, and was the opening song in MBM's 2005-2006 tour.

Can you tell me the answer to what part of new york is albany located??","completion":"Albany, the capital city of New York State, is located in the eastern part of the state on the west bank of the Hudson River. Geographically situated in the central region of upstate New York, Albany lies approximately 150 miles (241 kilometers) north of the bustling metropolis of New York City and about 140 miles (225 kilometers) west of Boston. This strategic location has been central to Albany's development and growth since its establishment in the 17th century. Albany is part of the Capital District, an area encompassing the four neighboring counties of Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, and Saratoga. This region serves as a crucial economic, political, and cultural hub of the state. With a population of roughly 98,000 in the city proper (2020 census) and over one million inhabitants in the greater Capital District, Albany is the sixth-largest city in New York State by population. The area that is now Albany was originally inhabited by Native Americans, particularly the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and the Mohican tribes. Dutch settlers began colonizing the area in 1624, and the Dutch Trading Post of Fort Nassau was built on the west bank of the Hudson River the same year, marking the beginning of European settlement in the region. In 1629, the Dutch West India Company established a patroonship formally named New Netherland, with the city of Beverwijck as its central hub in the region. The city was later renamed Albany, after the English Duke of Albany, when the English conquered New Netherland in 1664. Albany has a rich history that dates back over 400 years and is well-established as a key center in the development of the United States. The Albany Congress of 1754, which saw representatives from seven of the Thirteen Colonies gather to discuss a common defense against the French, led to the signing of the Albany Plan of Union, a proposal to create a unified government for the British colonies in what later became the United States. During the American Revolution, Albany was a strategic location, and the city saw the passage of troops, supplies, and crucial information. After the Revolution, the city became a center of trade, transportation, and industry, taking advantage of its strategic location and access to the Hudson River. In 1797, the city of Albany was officially named the capital of New York State. Today, Albany continues to serve as a governmental center, hosting the New York State Capitol and the Governor's Mansion, as well as being home to numerous government agencies and institutions. The city also boasts numerous parks, historic sites, museums, and cultural attractions that provide a glimpse into its rich and storied past. Some notable sites include the Albany Institute of History and Art, the New York State Museum, and the Palace Theatre. In addition to its political and historical significance, Albany and the surrounding Capital District have emerged as important centers for higher education and business. The region is home to several distinguished universities, including the University at Albany (SUNY), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Union College. Additionally, the area has become a research and development hub for cutting-edge industries such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and alternative energy. In conclusion, Albany is located in the eastern part of New York State, in the central region of upstate New York along the Hudson River. As the state capital and a key center for history, culture, education, and industry, Albany plays a significant role in the continuing development and growth of New York State and the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can't use English word like a Chinese one.. Be sure not to make the same mistake again.\\" After that I began to pay more attention to the differences between Chinese and English. For example, in English we say a\\" high mountain\\", but a\\" tall man. \\" In Chinese we use the same word \\"gao \\" for both..

Q:The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors began deliberations Thursday in the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial, potentially bringing the contentious case to a close after five months of testimony and three days of closing arguments. The 12 jurors spent two hours in the jury room Thursday afternoon before ending their day; they will return Friday morning for more deliberations. Katherine Jackson's lawyer delivered his final arguments in the AEG Live trial Thursday morning, delivering his rebuttal to defense closing arguments. AEG Live's Marvin Putnam had asked jurors to find Michael Jackson responsible for his death, not the company that promoted and produced his comeback concerts in 2009. \\"The sad truth is Mr. Jackson's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without","completion":"AEG Live,\\" Putnam said. \\"The evidence is overwhelming that he never would have agreed to the brief treatment urged by his family (and AEG Live), and everybody in this courtroom knows it.\\" Katherine Jackson's lawyer, Brian Panish, vehemently disagreed with Putnam's assertion. Panish claimed AEG Live played a significant role in Michael Jackson's death and should be held accountable. Panish reminded the jurors of the company's alleged negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician responsible for administering the fatal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to Michael Jackson. \\"You don't think someone should accept responsibility, and that's the problem,\\" Panish said, addressing Putnam's argument. \\"This case is about shared responsibility, and AEG is trying to escape that.\\" Panish accused AEG Live of prioritizing money and profit over the well-being of Michael Jackson, putting pressure on the star which led to his eventual demise. Moreover, he argued that AEG failed to conduct a proper background check when hiring Dr. Murray, ignoring his financial troubles, and subsequently offering him a contract with a lucrative 150,000 salary. This large sum, Panish claimed, created a conflict of interest for Dr. Murray, incentivizing him to do whatever Michael Jackson asked to keep his job, including administering the lethal dose of propofol. The wrongful-death lawsuit was filed on behalf of Michael Jackson's mother and three children after the singer's death in 2009. The plaintiffs are seeking billions of dollars in damages from AEG Live, alleging that the company's negligence in hiring and supervising Dr. Conrad Murray contributed directly to Michael Jackson's death. The defense's closing arguments focused on shifting the responsibility of Jackson's death onto the singer himself, highlighting his addiction to prescription drugs. Putnam pointed out that Michael Jackson had a long history of drug abuse, and AEG Live had no way of knowing that Dr. Murray would act negligently and irresponsibly when the company hired him. The defense also argued that Katherine Jackson's claims that AEG Live failed to properly hire and supervise Dr. Murray were unfounded, as Michael Jackson insisted on Murray being his personal doctor, and AEG Live did not have the authority to overrule his wishes. As the jurors began their deliberations, the entire world watched anxiously, waiting for the verdict that would determine whether AEG Live would be considered partially or fully responsible for Michael Jackson's death. The outcome of the case would have far-reaching implications on not just the Jackson family, but also on the entertainment industry, by potentially setting a precedent for holding concert promoters and producers accountable for the well-being of the artists they work with. Regardless of the verdict, the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial has brought attention to the darker side of the entertainment industry. It has illuminated how the pressures of fame, profit, and productivity can lead to tragic consequences, pushing those involved to their breaking points. This trial could serve as a cautionary tale for the industry, prompting a reevaluation of priorities, where artists' health and wellbeing are not sacrificed for profit and productivity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to address a senator Use \\" the honorable \\" on the envelope. \\" the honorable \\" is a title typically given to elected officials. When writing to a senator, start with the title and then type the senator's first and last name.","completion":"Addressing a senator is an important aspect of maintaining proper etiquette and showing respect to the individual holding this prestigious position. It is crucial to understand that addressing a senator is more than just knowing how to put their name on the envelope. It also includes how to address them in various situations such as in written correspondence, in person, or even during an introduction. First, let's discuss the correct way to address a senator in writing. 1. Letter Writing In written correspondence, utilizing \\"The Honorable\\" is definitely the appropriate way to address a senator. The complete format for a senator's address on the envelope should be: The Honorable [Full Name] United States Senate Office Address Inside the letter, the salutation should be: Dear Senator [Last Name]: This format should be used when writing any letter to a senator, whether it is a request for help, an invitation, or simply for expressing your opinion on a specific issue. 2. Email Correspondence For email correspondence, using the same formal address may not be necessary since emails are generally less formal. Instead, start the email with a professional greeting like: Dear Senator [Last Name], Remember to follow formal writing etiquette, keep a formal tone, and use professional language throughout the email. 3. In person When addressing a senator in person or introducing them to others, use the term \\"Senator\\" followed by their last name. For example, \\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Senator Smith.\\" When introducing a senator to someone else, you could say, \\"I would like to introduce you to Senator Smith.\\" However, if the senator is also a medical doctor or has another title, you should address them with the highest-ranking title they possess (Doctor, Professor, etc.). 4. Public Speaking Addressing a senator while giving a public speech should follow a formal approach: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Senator [Full Name] from [State].\\" This shows proper respect to the senator and the audience. In conclusion, it is essential to follow the proper etiquette when addressing a senator, whether in writing, in person, or during an introduction. By using the appropriate titles, you demonstrate respect for their position as this official represents the interests of their constituents in the United States Senate. Adhering to these guidelines will not only maintain civility, but also help establish a professional tone in your interactions with the senators."},{"prompt":"Q: What do plants lose the most of through the stomata?

Sanjay was passionate about music and community service, so he decided to use his talents and co-organize a charity concert at his college. He mobilized his classmates and friends, secured the necessary permissions, and started promoting the event. As the preparations for the concert were well underway, Geetha, a beautiful and kind-hearted girl at the college, decided to attend. She admired Sanjay's zeal for helping others and secretly harbored feelings for him. For months, she had been captivated by his charming personality, but never had the courage to disclose her feelings for fear of rejection or embarrassment. During the charity concert, Sanjay and his friends gave spectacular performances, and the event was a roaring success. The entire college was abuzz, and several funds were raised for a noble cause. Thrilled by the outcome, Geetha grew more and more attracted to Sanjay, and she couldn't contain her emotions any longer. After one of Sanjay's enchanting songs at the concert, Geetha found the perfect opportunity to confess her love for him. She approached him backstage and, mustering all her courage, poured her heart out. Much to Geetha's delight, Sanjay reciprocated her feelings, saying he had noticed her from afar and was touched by her kind and selfless nature. Moving forward in their relationship, Sanjay uncovered a dark secret that was being kept from Geetha. He discovered that Geetha had a rare form of blood cancer, but she and her father were completely unaware of her condition. Sanjay was devastated by the news but determined to support and stand by Geetha through thick and thin. Sanjay mustered all his courage and approached Geetha's mother, deciding to inform her about her daughter's illness. Together, they discussed the possible implications, and after much contemplation, they decided to reveal the truth to Geetha and her father. It was an extremely difficult conversation, but they knew that the sooner they sought treatment, the better Geetha's chances of survival were. As the treatment process began, the illness started taking a toll on Geetha's eyes. Her vision began to deteriorate, and as days went by, it became harder and harder for her to see. Despite the physical challenges, Geetha remained strong and hopeful, with Sanjay by her side providing unwavering love and support. Sanjay continued organizing charity concerts and dedicated each one to Geetha, drawing inspiration from her strength and resilience. With every progressive event, funds were raised and donated to research for blood cancer treatment advancements. Though the road was long and difficult, Geetha gradually recovered, and her condition stabilized. In the process, she and Sanjay only grew closer, realizing the immeasurable strength of their bond. This tale of love, courage, and selflessness became a legend in the town. People spoke of how two young individuals faced adversity and showed everyone that even in the darkest of times, love and hope could prevail. And so, Sanjay and Geetha's love story is remembered as a testament to the unwavering human spirit, where the power of love, compassion, and resilience triumphs over hardship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Johnson on affirmative action?\\" Context: \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"President Ronald Reagan disagreed with Lyndon B.

This desire for change often stems from the belief that current societal norms, values, or structures may be negatively affecting the well-being of its members, and thus, a transformation would lead to a better quality of life for everyone involved. While the other possible answers provided can potentially play a role in a changing society or may even be consequences of those changes, they do not appear to directly focus on the well-being and happiness of the individuals within the society. - New laws: These can be the means to achieve a change in society, but they are not the driving motivation behind the desire for change in and of themselves. - Confusion and chaos: While societal change can sometimes lead to confusion and chaos, it is unlikely that a person desiring change would have these as their primary motives. - Cultural revolution: This can be an aspect of a changing society, usually involving a drastic change in ideas, values, and beliefs. While this may lead to happiness, it is more focused on ideological changes rather than happiness as a primary motivation. - Train: This option seems unrelated to the question at hand. In conclusion, the pursuit of \\"happiness for\\" the individuals within a society is a more likely motive for someone seeking a changing society. This motivation is based on the idea that the well-being and contentment of the members of the society should be the primary focus, and therefore changes are necessary to achieve this goal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose a coat hanger: Pick a coat hanger made of metal wire, because it's easy to bend with your hands. Avoid plastic coat hangers, as they can break when you try to bend them. 2. Think about the shape: Imagine the shape you want to create with the coat hanger. It can be a simple shape like a circle or a heart or something more complicated like an animal or a word. 3. Start bending: Hold the coat hanger with both hands, and start slowly bending it into the shape you have in mind. Use your fingers and hands to apply gentle pressure at different points along the wire to create curves and angles. 4. Take your time: Bending the coat hanger might take some effort and patience. If it's not perfect the first time, that's okay! Keep adjusting and bending until you're happy with the shape. 5. Use tools if needed: If you're having trouble bending the coat hanger with just your hands or if you want to create sharper angles, you can use pliers to help you. Be careful not to pinch your fingers, though! 6. Finishing touches: Once you've made the desired shape, you can smooth out any rough edges with a piece of sandpaper or file. This will make sure your new creation is safe to touch and use. And there you have it! You've successfully bent a coat hanger into a desired shape.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Where was the language based on the Boko alphabet primarily used? Answer:","completion":"The language based on the Boko alphabet is primarily used in the West African region, specifically in the countries of Nigeria and Niger. Before diving into the details, let's first understand the Boko alphabet and its origin. The Boko script, also known as the Hausa boko or the Hausa ajami script, is an indigenous writing system that has been adopted by the Hausa people, who are one of the largest ethnic groups in West Africa. The Hausa language is a Chadic language, a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and it is spoken by more than 40 million people across the region. The main areas where the Hausa language is spoken include Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, and Ghana, among others. However, the use of the Boko alphabet is mostly concentrated in Nigeria and Niger. The Boko alphabet has its origins in the early 20th century, born out of modifications to the Arabic script. The modifications were made to accommodate distinct Hausa phonemes that weren't present in Arabic. The term \\"boko\\" is likely derived from the English word \\"book,\\" as the script was primarily employed in secular literature and educational materials, in contrast with the Ajami script that was predominantly used for religious texts. In Nigeria, the Boko script was adopted as a means of communication among Hausa-speaking communities, particularly in the northern parts of the country. The colonial administration of Nigeria, under the British rule, played a significant role in popularizing the script by promoting the standardized Boko alphabet for official communication, education, and publishing. Similarly, in Niger, the use of the Boko script was mainly centered in the Hausa-speaking regions, particularly in the southern parts of the country, where the Hausa community has a strong presence. The script was used in various written materials such as government documents, educational textbooks, and literary works. Nowadays, the Boko alphabet has been largely replaced by the Latin script, especially in the educational system and official communications. However, the use of the Boko script still remains significant, particularly within religious and cultural contexts. Overall, the language based on the Boko alphabet continues to hold importance in preserving the heritage and traditions of the Hausa communities in Nigeria and Niger."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Japanese funerals are highly ritualized affairs which are generally--though not always--conducted in accordance with Buddhist rites. In preparation for the funeral, the body is washed and the orifices are blocked with cotton or gauze. The encoffining ritual (called nokan), as depicted in Departures, is rarely performed, and even then only in rural areas. This ceremony is not standardized, but generally involves professional morticians (Na Guan Shi , nokanshi) ritually preparing the body, dressing the dead in white, and sometimes applying make-up. The body is then put on dry ice in a casket, along with personal possessions and items necessary for the trip to the afterlife. Despite the importance of death rituals, in traditional Japanese culture the subject is considered unclean as everything related to death is thought to be a source of kegare (defilement). After coming into contact with the dead, individuals must cleanse themselves through purifying rituals. People who work closely with the dead, such as morticians, are thus considered unclean, and during the feudal era those whose work was related to death became burakumin (untouchables), forced to live in their own hamlets and discriminated against by wider society. Despite a cultural shift since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the stigma of death still has considerable force within Japanese society, and discrimination against the untouchables has continued. Until 1972, most deaths were dealt with by families, funeral homes, or nokanshi. As of 2014, about 80% of deaths occur in hospitals, and preparation of the bodies is frequently done by hospital staff; in such cases, the family often does not see the body until the funeral. A 1998 survey found that 29.5% of the Japanese population believed in an afterlife, and a further 40% wanted to believe; belief was highest among the young. Belief in the existence of a soul (54%) and a connection between the worlds of the living and the dead (64.9%) was likewise common.

Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them. Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends. By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed.

Over her lifetime, Portia Nelson built a reputation that went beyond the confines of her small-town roots, becoming a prominent figure in the 20th-century American entertainment industry and leaving a lasting legacy.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Process: - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways - Question: suppose the location is quiet happens, how will it affect the bat has a lower perception of the sound waves. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"B: Less To understand the answer, let's analyze the process of echolocation in quiet vs. noisy environments in detail. The quiet location would have a significant effect on the bat's perception of sound waves, making their echolocation more accurate and precise. When the environment is quiet, there is minimal interference from other sounds, which allows the bat to detect the subtleties of the returning sound waves more effectively. Consequently, the bat would be able to obtain more accurate information about the size, shape, and position of objects in its surroundings, thereby increasing its chances of successfully hunting for prey and avoiding obstacles. In a noisy environment, bats face the challenge of interference from various competing sounds or noises in the surroundings. These could be generated by other animals or human activities, among other factors. These additional sounds make it difficult for the bat to recognize the returning sound waves generated by its own high-pitched tones with the same level of accuracy and precision, as they get masked or interfered with by the external noises. As a result, bats may require more energy and time to compensate for this challenge and rely more on their other senses as well to accurately navigate their environment. To sum up, a quiet location would lead to less interference and better perception of sound waves for a bat using echolocation, resulting in more accurate and effective navigation of its surroundings. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Less."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Ned got infected with HIV because they re-used a needle. His friend Nate was not infected. Which colleague didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk? Hint: The Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) is the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ). Most researchers believe that the HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century. HIV is transmitted by sexual contact and by contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. It is also passed from mother to fetus. HIV is now a pandemic , with an estimated (as of 2008) 38.6 million people now living with the disease worldwide. It is estimated that AIDS has killed more than 25 million people since it was first recognized in 1981. For further information about HIV/AIDS, see the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) web site at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/ . A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is evident that Nate is the colleague who didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk. In this scenario, both Ned and Nate gave blood for an emergency. Unfortunately, Ned got infected with HIV due to the re-use of a needle. On the other hand, Nate remained uninfected. As mentioned, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted via contact with infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, breast milk, and vaginal secretions. Considering that Nate was not infected with HIV, it can be concluded that he didn't have the virus that could be transmitted through contact with infected breast milk. The HIV pandemic has had a significant impact on global public health, with millions of people affected worldwide. Raising awareness about the virus, its transmission methods, and preventive measures is crucial to curbing its spread. This includes promoting safe practices such as using sterile needles during medical procedures, encouraging protected sex, and ensuring proper screening of blood products. To recap, in response to the question, Nate is the colleague who didn't have a virus that is transmitted by contact with infected breast milk, as he did not contract HIV during the blood donation incident. For more information on HIV/AIDS, resources from health organizations such as the CDC can provide valuable insights and up-to-date information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie tells the story in pictures accompanied by the entire Brave record minus \\"Paper Lies\\" and the final song \\"Made Again\\". On the recording, it is left ambiguous as to whether the main character commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Thus, \\"Made Again\\", which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included. On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the description reads as follows: Brave.. The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction. On the bottom of the cover, the final lines are: \\"Watch it loud with the lights off.\\" Answer:","completion":"Title Suggestion: \\"Lost on the Severn: A Brave Descent\\" Explanation: The suggested movie title, \\"Lost on the Severn: A Brave Descent,\\" captures the essence of the movie plot and accurately represents the central theme of the story. The film revolves around a young girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her subsequent search for her past. By incorporating the location of the Severn Bridge and the word \\"Brave\\" from the associated Marillion album, the title creates a clear connection between the music and the film. Additionally, the subtitle \\"A Brave Descent\\" alludes to the darker turn the plot takes towards the end, where the main character ultimately commits suicide. Overall, this title encapsulates the emotional weight and the mystery that pervades the young girl's journey while maintaining a connection to the source material that inspired it. The audience is enticed to delve into this story, experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions and possibly pondering the complexities of life and the human experience, especially when encouraged to \\"watch it loud with the lights off.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Which wing in the building that's largest first floor room is called the Withdrawing Room came to be the service wing? , can you please find it? The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall.

Movie plot title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed.

To do this, subtract 48*g from both sides of the equation. 5*g - 48*g = 48*g - 774 - 48*g → -43*g = -774 Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -43 to solve for g.

What is the answer to this question? in the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in?","completion":"In the Old English poem \\"The Dream of the Rood,\\" the rood, or cross, is eventually drenched in the blood of Jesus Christ. The poem is a unique and powerful fusion of Christian and Anglo-Saxon heroic tropes, in which the rood itself is personified and serves as the narrator, recounting the story of Christ's crucifixion and the rood's own role in it. In the poem, the dreamer witnesses a vision of a magnificent tree (the rood) that is alternately adorned with gold and gems and covered in blood. The rood goes on to recount its own history, from being cut down in a forest and assembled as a crucifix to the arrival of Christ, the \\"young hero\\" who willingly ascends the cross in order to save humanity from its sins. The rood then describes the harrowing scene of the crucifixion and is eventually drenched in Christ's blood. This blood, symbolic of Christ's sacrifice, sanctifies the rood and transforms it into a holy relic. The poem emphasizes the physical pain and suffering that both Christ and the rood endure, casting them both as heroes who bear the weight of their respective roles with courage and fortitude. Once Christ has died and is taken down from the cross, the rood is also later taken down and buried in a deep pit. However, the rood does not remain buried forever; it is later discovered, adorned with gold and gems, and venerated as a sacred object. This resurrection of the rood mirrors the resurrection of Christ, reinforcing the connection between the two. The poem concludes with the dreamer reflecting upon the message of the rood, with a newfound understanding of the deep significance of Christ's sacrifice and the importance of redemption and salvation. The rood, by bearing witness to Christ's crucifixion and being drenched in his holy blood, serves as a powerful symbol of the merging of the divine and human worlds. In summary, in \\"The Dream of the Rood,\\" the rood is eventually drenched in the blood of Jesus Christ as it shares in the sacrifice and suffering of the crucifixion. This transformative event links the rood and Christ together as heroic figures, each bearing a crucial role in the salvation of humanity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of Wolfgang Mozart's father? ? In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Choices: - farm - nature preserve - soup - canada - mountainous area The rationale to choose \\"nature preserve\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Nature preserves, also known as wildlife sanctuaries or reserves, are the correct choice for effectively protecting animals such as the bald eagle. The rationale for choosing \\"nature preserve\\" as the answer lies in its purpose, management techniques, and conservation goals. 1. Purpose: Nature preserves are designated areas specifically aimed at protecting and preserving wildlife, including various species of animals, plants, and ecosystems. They serve as safe havens for vulnerable or threatened species like the bald eagle, ensuring their survival and well-being. 2. Management Techniques: Nature preserves are managed through a combination of habitat conservation, strict regulations, monitoring, and public education. Activities like hunting, land development, and resource exploitation are typically restricted or regulated to ensure the least disturbance to resident wildlife populations. This creates a stable environment for the conservation of species like the bald eagle. 3. Conservation Goals: Nature preserves have a primary goal of preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological integrity. By focusing on these goals, they contribute significantly to the conservation of species like the bald eagle. On the other hand, farms, soups, and mountainous areas are not specifically designed for wildlife protection, and their primary purposes do not necessarily align with conserving endangered species. Additionally, while Canada does have protected areas for wildlife, it is a country and not a specific place dedicated to animal protection like a nature preserve would be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less trees around happens, how will it affect more rising trees provide shelter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"A decrease in the number of trees within an ecosystem can affect the natural process of forest formation, as well as the overall health of the ecosystem, through direct and indirect effects. A: Direct effects of the perturbation: 1. Less Organic Matter: With fewer trees, there is less dead material available to decay and release vital nutrients for the growth of new trees. This can slow down the regeneration process and hinder the establishment of a healthy forest. 2. Reduced Shelter: The presence of fewer trees means that there is less shelter provided for various organisms, which can lower species diversity and population densities, negatively impacting the overall health of the ecosystem. 3. Altered Microclimate: Trees play a critical role in maintaining a suitable microclimate for other organisms by providing shade, temperature regulation, and moisture retention. With fewer trees, these conditions can become less favorable, making it harder for some species to survive and potentially preventing the forest from recovering. B: Indirect effects of the perturbation: 1. Soil Erosion and Loss of Nutrients: With less vegetation, there is a higher likelihood of soil erosion due to wind and rain, which can lead to nutrient loss in the soil, making it less fertile for the establishment of new trees. 2. Invasion by Weedy Species: The decline in tree density can create open niches for opportunistic species to establish themselves. These species can compete with or hinder the growth of native trees and affect overall ecosystem dynamics. 3. Disruption of Ecological Relationships: The reduced number of trees can affect the ecosystem's complex network of interactions among living organisms, such as plant-animal pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms. This disruption can impede forest succession and change the overall community composition. 4. Changes in Hydrological Cycles: Trees significantly contribute to the hydrological cycle by intercepting rainfall, reducing evaporation, and increasing infiltration. A lack of trees can affect the water cycle in the area, potentially leading to changes in water availability for the local environment. In summary, the perturbation of having fewer trees around can directly and indirectly impact the process of forest formation and the ecosystem's health. Lower tree density can lead to reduced organic matter input, inadequate shelter, altered microclimate, soil erosion, invasion by weedy species, disruption of ecological interactions, and changes in the hydrological cycle, potentially slowing down or impairing the development of a healthy and diverse forest ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What are the human organs that are unneccesary to insects?\\" is in \\"Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity.:61–65 Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles.\\".

Summarize this article: After the first leg of their play-off finished goalless, Fraser Mullen, for Beath, and Kieran Gibbons, for Kilby, netted in normal time. With no further score after 30 more minutes of play, the hosts scored all five of their spot-kicks. Liam Henderson struck the decisive penalty, keeping Gary Locke's side in Scottish League Two. The home side came flying out of the traps and duly took the lead after just three minutes. There was excellent build-up play down the left involving Robbie Buchannan and Dale Carrick, before Henderson laid the ball off for Mullen. The former Hearts and Hibernian defender drilled a low shot beyond Matthew McGinley in the visiting goal to break the deadlock. The Blue Brazil keep their foot on the gas, and only a magnificent stop by McGinley denied Carrick from doubling the lead. The striker also crashed a header off the crossbar before Kris Renton's deflected volley flew inches wide. East Kilbride slowly eased their way into the game and Joao Victoria, then Sean Winter, came close to a leveller. The Lowland League champions began the second half on the front foot and had claims for a penalty turned down by referee Craig Charleston after the ball appeared to strike the arm of David Syme. The Lanarkshire side's pressure did pay off, though, when the home defence failed to clear their lines, allowing Gibbons to drill the ball along the slippery surface from 25 yards out and find the bottom corner. Neither side were able to strike a knockout blow before normal time expired, and the game East Kilbride's Adam Strachan fired in a deflected 20-yard effort that struck the crossbar on its way over. Both teams looked weary as the rain-soaked pitch began to take its toll. but Cowdenbeath almost snatched a late winner through Craig Johnston, whose effort was tipped over by McGinley. With Mullen, Johnston, Renton and Syme netting spot-kicks for Cowdenbeath, and Strachan, Russell McLean and Victoria replying, it was Jamie Sneddon's save from Paul Woods that proved crucial. The stop gave Henderson the opportunity to seal victory for the Blue Brazil, and the defender duly converted his penalty, preserving Cowden's SPFL status, and consigning East Kilbride to another season of junior football. Cowdenbeath manager Gary Locke: \\"I don't think it's really anything to celebrate. The chairman is a flamboyant character, and when I came to the club, he said, we're in the play-offs, just win them for us. \\"Credit to the players, they've battled really hard over the two games. East Kilbride were fantastic, I certainly feel if they came up they'd be top-four or top-five team in this league. \\"So it was a really difficult two games, it gets to be a bit of a lottery when it goes to penalties, but I'm delighted the club's kept their place in the league, because the consequences of going down would've been pretty tough, I'd have thought.\\" East Kilbride manager Martin Lauchlan: \\"It's devastating - we put so much into the game. We lost a goal early - the worst possible start we could've had - but after that we looked the better team and the more likely to score. \\"I think our fitness levels looked terrific. It's so difficult to get to this point, with so many play-off games, and to get here and lose it is tough. \\"I think they showed in the game they're well capable of playing at this level, but we're bitterly disappointed.\\" Match ends, Cowdenbeath 1(5), East Kilbride 1(3).

After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of \\"marines\\" (most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits). The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits him in the eye.Landing safely on the Moon, the astronomers get out of the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the six astronomers and take them to the palace of their king.

Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than Rachel, because Choices: * Natalie had an adventurous spirit.; * Rachel had an adventurous spirit.;","completion":"Natalie was more likely to travel to a foreign country than Rachel, because Natalie had an adventurous spirit. This isn't to say that Rachel didn't have her share of adventurousness, but Natalie’s spirit seemed to always be driven by the compelling desire to explore the unknown, to delve into cultures vastly different from her own, and to embrace the spontaneous, untamed nature of travel. There was a spark in her eye when tales of far-off lands, unique cultures, mysterious traditions, and unfamiliar cuisines were shared, a spark that didn't ignite into a flame in Rachel's eyes with the same intensity. Rachel, unlike Natalie, who was drawn to the mysteries hidden in the crannies of the world, preferred the comforts of familiar environments. Her adventures were more homely, more rooted in exploring depths within the known rather than seeking alien experiences in the unknown. She was an explorer too, but more of familiar spaces and places. An unveiled backyard mystery or a newly discovered hiking route near her town thrilled Rachel. Her adventurous spirit was more attuned to deepening connections with well-known territories, rather than establishing new ones in unexplored regions. On the other hand, Natalie was a true globetrotter at heart. Her sense of adventure thrived on the thrills of stepping into a new land, soaking in its heritage, welcoming its cultural flavors, and navigating through its labyrinthine streets. Every travel anecdote enriched her soul and fueled her craving for more such experiences. She was constantly looking at maps, tracing a finger along invisible routes, dreaming about future voyages. The world, in her eyes, was an open book she intended to read cover to cover. Foreign languages fascinated her, and exotic food stimulated her palate. In contrast, Rachel relished the feeling of being surrounded by the familiar chatter of her own language and savored traditional dishes cooked in her home's kitchen more than the finest overseas cuisines. Her spirit of adventure was not limited, it was just of a different kind, more intricate and deeply rooted in home ground. Rachel admired Natalie's passion for exploring foreign lands, and Natalie respected Rachel's devotion to finding beauty in the familiar. Their unique adventurous spirits took them down different paths, one toward the vastness of the globe, and the other delving deeper into a localized terrain. But, despite their contrasting preferences, their paths were entwined as they both sought to experience the world in their own ways, identifying the profound common thread between them – the joy of discovery and the expansion of their life's experiences. Yet, it was Natalie, with her boldly ambitious spirit for global exploration, who was more likely to leave her footprints on foreign shores. Her adventurous spirit became the compass, pointing her towards new horizons and uncharted territories. Therefore, when the question of traveling to a foreign country came up, everyone knew that it would be Natalie who would pack her bags first, ready to meet the world in its diversity and grandeur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975 and began work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue working with them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned to Brian Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark Side of the Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early sessions as \\"falling within a difficult period\\" and Waters found them \\"tortuous\\". Gilmour was more interested in improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise and with a sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks. During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: \\"Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd.\\"While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio. Thorgerson recalled that he \\"sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there\\". He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member who was upset when a past band member visited the studio and no one initially recognized him?, what is it ?

However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: \\"Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.\\" The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson states about a character who was misunderstood, \\"when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice,\\" to which he responds, \\"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Composers of classical music have often made use of folk music (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like Dvořák and Smetana, have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like Bartók have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Folk musicians are not commonly what?","completion":"Folk musicians are not commonly classically trained. This aspect of folk musicians plays a significant role in the characteristics and development of folk music itself, as well as its influence on classical music composers. Folk music arises mainly from oral traditions and is deeply rooted in the cultural and ethnic identity of a particular region or community. The music usually reflects the experiences, emotions, and historical stories of the people belonging to that region. Given its nature, folk music often evolves through generations as it is passed down, acquiring new elements, and reflecting the changing circumstances of the community. Folk musicians typically learn their craft through informal settings such as family gatherings, community events, and informal mentoring. They often play traditional instruments that are native to their culture and use them to perform music which may include elements such as improvisation and variations on existing themes. The lack of formal training in folk musicians presents a stark contrast to the structured education and technical prowess found in classically trained musicians. The classical music tradition stems from a written notation system, with well-established rules and a rich history of development. Composers who are classically trained generally have profound knowledge of music theory, orchestration, and structure, allowing them to use this foundation to create intricate and nuanced works. Despite the differences between folk and classical music, several composers throughout history have recognized the value of integrating folk elements into classical compositions. Such composers not only pay homage to the cultural roots of their respective nations but also enhance their artistic works with unique textures and melodies. A few examples of these composers include: 1. Antonín Dvořák: A Czech composer known for incorporating folk influences into his compositions, Dvořák's works evoke a strong sense of national pride and identity. Notable examples are his Symphony No. 9 \\"From the New World,\\" which was inspired by African-American spirituals and Native American music, and his Slavonic Dances, which draw upon influences from Slavic folk dances. 2. Bedřich Smetana: Another Czech composer, Smetana used folk themes and dances to infuse his compositions with a sense of national identity. His most famous work, \\"Má vlast,\\" is a cycle of six symphonic poems, each representing an aspect of Czech culture, history, or landscape. 3. Béla Bartók: A Hungarian composer and pianist, Bartók was an avid collector and researcher of his country's folk music. He incorporated these folk influences into numerous compositions, merging them with classical forms to create a unique sound. His Mikrokosmos, a collection of piano exercises, and his series of string quartets are notable examples of this fusion. These composers, among others, demonstrate how the distinctive qualities of folk music, despite its musicians not commonly being classically trained, can be woven into classical compositions, enriching both genres and broadening the scope of musical expression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can draw the ends of the twine up and match them to be sure the twine is centered. Grasp the twine on each side a couple of inches from the bird and slide it up under both wings until it is snug in the armpits. Be sure the neck flap is covering the hole at the top of the turkey. Draw the twine together across the neck flap, holding it in place. Cross the strings one on top of the other and pull tightly. Pull both sides along the outside of the turkey breast, staying on the inside of the wings and legs. Cross the strings under the bottom of the rib cage and pull the ends tight. Maneuver the twine under the top portion of the turkey legs, or drumsticks. Wrap the twine around back of the leg, then back over the top at the leg joint. Cross the twine, then pull the ends back under the turkey legs. Pull the ends outward to tighten the twine and elevate the legs.

Given the below context: Although Watts's plans for the memorial had envisaged names inscribed on the wall, in the event the memorial was designed to hold panels of hand-painted and glazed ceramic tiles. Watts was an acquaintance of William De Morgan, at that time one of the world's leading tile designers, and consequently found them easier and cheaper to obtain than engraved stone. The four initial memorial tablets, installed for the unveiling, each consisted of two large custom-made tiles, with each tablet costing £3 5s (about £360 as of 2019) to produce. Only four tablets were installed by the time of the unveiling ceremony, and Watts already had concerns about the potential costs of installing the 120 tablets envisaged in the memorial's design.Costs were allayed by using standard 6-inch (15 cm) tiles for the next set of tablets, reducing the costs to a more manageable £2 per tablet. In 1902, nine further tablets were installed, intermittently spaced along the central of the five rows, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had lobbied. The subjects of the 13 initial tiles had been personally selected by Watts, who had for many years maintained a list of newspaper reports of heroic actions potentially worthy of recognition. However, by this time he was in his eighties and in increasingly poor health, and in January 1904 the vicar and churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate formed the Humble Heroes Memorial Committee to oversee the completion of the project, agreeing to defer to Watts regarding additions to the memorial. Watts strenuously objected to the name, as \\"not being applicable to anything as splendid as heroic self-sacrifice\\", and the committee was renamed the \\"Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee\\".On 1 July 1904 George Frederic Watts died at New Little Holland House, aged 87.

Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band?, what is it ?

When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.\\"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, \\" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. \\"There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,\\" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food. When Hannan said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply,she meant that _ . A) rich people drank more water than the poor B) rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut C) she had a rich neighbor who often helped her during water supply cuts D) the rich were not affected by water supply cuts Answer:","completion":"When Hannan said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply, she meant that B) rich people could buy water from the water trucks if there was a water supply cut. This is because those with more financial resources can afford to purchase water at a higher cost, and are able to ensure they have access to water even when supplies are scarce. In contrast, people with lesser means struggle to afford water during such times and may have to rely on the help of their neighbors or other forms of assistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Starting with syntax, it follows the correct structure or order of words and phrases in a sentence to make the sentence meaningful. In English, the typical sentence follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which the sentence adheres to. In this case, \\"You and I\\" is the subject, \\"are\\" is the verb, and \\"as little alike as a horse and a cow\\" is the object. In terms of verb agreement, the plural form \\"are\\" correctly matches with the plural compound subject \\"You and I.\\" Furthermore, the usage of the comparative construction \\"as...as\\" is accurate. The \\"as...as\\" construction is used to compare two entities in terms of a specific property or quality - in this case, the quality being \\"alikeness\\" or similarity. Moving on to semantic acceptability, the sentence is also semantically correct, meaning the sentence makes sense in terms of its meaning in the context of standard English. Here, the speaker is comparing the level of dissimilarity between \\"you and I\\" to the level of dissimilarity between \\"a horse and a cow.\\" Although horses and cows are both mammals and have similarities, they are also quite different in many ways (differences in physical structure, behavior, etc.), so this comparison implies a high level of dissimilarity. So, the sentence \\"You and I are as little alike as a horse and a cow,\\" effectively communicates this intended message and does so in a way that is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Therefore, it can be considered both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

(2) Born on November 1 , 1986 , Ashley is a contemporary dancer from Arizona , who was originally raised in Los Angeles . Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"These two sentences convey similar information about Ashley but have subtle differences in presentation. Both sentences state that Ashley was born on November 1, 1986, and that she is a contemporary dancer. However, the way her geographical background is portrayed differs. In Sentence 1, the sentence implies that Ashley is presently a contemporary dancer from Los Angeles but originally grew up in Arizona. This interpretation suggests that Ashley may have spent her formative years in Arizona before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her dancing career or for other reasons. In Sentence 2, the sentence structures Ashley's life story differently. Here, it is stated that Ashley is a contemporary dancer from Arizona who was originally raised in Los Angeles. This leads readers to infer that Ashley spent her early years in Los Angeles and later moved to Arizona for unexplained reasons. She may have either started her dance career in Los Angeles and continued in Arizona or began her dancing journey in Arizona itself. Despite these differences in geographical context, both sentences still provide the same crucial elements of information: Ashley's birthdate and her profession as a contemporary dancer. While retaining essential details, the two sentences create slightly different impressions of Ashley's background, upbringing, and dance career, presenting two unique ways to understand her personal narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But I can use this background: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nucl What is an answer for this question: In which element is the shielding effect larger? A:","completion":"The shielding effect is larger in cesium. The reason is that as you move down the alkali metals group, the atomic size increases, and the valence electron is further from the nucleus. With an increase in distance and shielding effect, the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group.

Please answer the following question: This article: Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years?, what is it ?

My fiancu00e9e and I need something to eat during our layover so we stopped here. Aye aye aye :/ There weren't many people in line and there were 2 people at the cash register... We waited about 20 minutes just to pay for the premade food we took out of the cooler. Everyone in line was incredibly frustrated by the ridiculously slow service. We made it back to our gate just in time to eat before they started boarding the plane. I feel like in an airport, service needs to be very efficient; people may not have a lot of time between flights to wait around. Anyway, the food: we got a sushi roll (9.99) and a spicy mango chicken wrap (I think it was 7.99). The sushi was definitely overpriced - I would normally pay about 6 for a roll like this at the sushi counter in a grocery store. It did taste fresh and was slightly better than I expected for the airport. The mango chicken wrap was really good, healthy, and filling. Again, I felt it was overpriced but that is to be expected when traveling. Pei Wei is an off-shoot of PF Chang. The menu items sounded delicious but we did not have time to place an order and then wait even longer for food. If I have the time, I would stop here and give them another chance.

The homeless man who decided to arm himself with a trolley and stand with police against a terrorist (7News) Trolly man : Michael Rogers has been the silent hero since the Melbourne attack (7News) 2:04 A bystander dubbed “the trolley man” for taking on an armed terrorist with a shopping cart during the deadly terror attack in Melbourne says he is “no hero” as his story comes to light. Michael Rogers, 46, attempted to help police officers stop Hassan Khalif Shire Ali during Friday’s Bourke Street terror attack. One person had already been stabbed to death and another two were injured. Mr Rogers, who is homeless with few possessions, began ramming a shopping trolley into the terrorist in a bid to help. “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him. I didn’t quite get him down, though. I’m no hero,” Mr Rogers told Seven News’ Robert Ovadia from the scene of the attack. Mr Ovadia later told the program, “people think he deserves some sort of award for being a hero. He doesn’t see himself necessarily as a hero but believes he did help save lives and defend his city as well.” Subscribe to news.com.au’s From The Newsroom podcast A GoFundMe has since been set up for Mr Rogers, raising 105,130 at time of publication. The fundraiser was created by Melbourne Homeless Collective, a registered charity that supports people experiencing homelessness. “All funds donated to this campaign will go directly to Mr Rogers to help get him back on his feet,” the page reads. “He’s a hero in our eyes and he can do what he feels best with any funds he receives. He risked his own life that day for nothing in return and you can’t put a price on that.” The charity had originally set a goal of 5000 but has since said it will no longer set a target due to the overwhelming amount of support. “We’re absolutely blown away by everyone’s generosity and spirit in helping our hero ‘Trolleyman’ get back on his feet,” the charity said. “We don’t actually have a set target to reach but due to the incredible generosity we’ve seen so far we’ll keep increasing the total accordingly. “We’ve far surpassed our original goal. Let’s aim for the sky. Our hero absolutely deserves it.” The Sunday Herald Sun tracked down Mr Rogers on a park bench, amid a nationwide bid to find the humble hero, just 24 hours after he risked his life to save others. The newspaper reported that Mr Rogers is homeless, but wasn’t concerned when his phone was smashed during the fight, despite not having the means to replace it. Mr Rogers was one of two bystanders who stepped in as the killer tried to claim more victims in the city. Witness footage of the incident uploaded to social media showed Mr Rogers running to one side of the street to get the trolley before pushing it towards Ali who was wielding a knife and lunging at police. A man with a shopping trolley twice tried to ram the man to stop him. Another was wielding a chair. Incredible bravery @theheraldsun pic.twitter.com/w473DKA4wr — Josh Fagan (@faganjosh) November 9, 2018 The trolley appeared to startle Ali before the man who pushed it tripped and fell to the ground. The terrorist then ran across the road, followed by police, as Mr Rogers got up and gave chase, pushing his cart towards the attacker a second time. His actions gained him widespread praise on social media by users who dubbed him “trolley man” and called for him to receive a medal or be made Prime Minister of Australia. Mr Rogers was reportedly unaware of the attention being heaped on him for his actions. One witness said she spoke to Mr Rogers at the scene and he told her his actions were “just instinctive to help the police protect the safety of others”, the Herald Sun reports. Mr Rogers told 7 News that he believes he did help save lives. “I’ve seen the trolley to the side so I’ve picked it up and I ran, threw the trolley straight at him, got him, but didn’t get him down,” he said. “I did that motion quite a number of times but it just wasn’t getting him down.” ⚡️ Melbourne: “I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Somali-born attacker, from Melbourne’s northwestern suburbs, had violated the nation’s trust. “The greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” he said. Mr Morrison said Ali was one of about 400 people on a national ASIO terror watch list. “Here in Australia we would be kidding ourselves if we did not call out the fact that the greatest threat of religious extremism in this country is the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam,” Mr Morrison said. “There is a special responsibility on religious leaders to protect their religious communities and to ensure dangerous teachings and ideologies do not take root here.” In a press conference on Saturday, Victoria Police confirmed Ali had been known to intelligence agencies for years, but he was not being actively monitored prior to the attack. They said his passport was cancelled in 2015 after ASIO determined he was planning to travel to Syria. ||||| Uodate 17/11/2018 We’ve reached our goal!

Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11.

Choices: - systems - additions - Changes - adaptations A: A:","completion":"Adaptations are the characteristics of an organism that help it survive in its environment. Adaptations, in the context of biology and evolution, can be defined as inherited traits or behaviors that increase an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in a specific environment. These adaptations may be structural, physiological, or behavioral. 1. Structural adaptations: These are physical features that have evolved in an organism to enable it to perform specific functions necessary for survival. Examples of structural adaptations include: - Camouflage: Some animals like the chameleon have developed the ability to change their color and blend in with their environment, making it difficult for predators to detect them. - Body shape: Organisms have different body shapes according to their habitat, enabling them to move easily and efficiently. For example, fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to swim effortlessly in water. - Specialized appendages: Many animals have developed specialized appendages that allow them to perform specific tasks, such as grasping, swimming, or digging. For example, birds have beaks that are suited for their specific diet – predators like eagles have sharp, hooked beaks for tearing flesh, while hummingbirds have long, slender beaks for reaching nectar within flowers. 2. Physiological adaptations: These adaptations are related to the internal functioning of an organism and involve changes in its biochemistry, metabolism, or cell structure. Examples of physiological adaptations include: - Thermoregulation: Certain animals, such as endotherms (warm-blooded animals), have developed the ability to maintain a stable internal body temperature, even in fluctuating external temperatures. This enables them to live in a wider range of environments compared to ectotherms (cold-blooded animals), whose body temperatures depend on the environment. - Water conservation: Desert animals, like the camel and kangaroo rat, show remarkable water conservation adaptations to survive in arid conditions. These include specialized kidneys that produce concentrated urine and a unique metabolic system that minimizes water loss. - Poison resistance: Some organisms have developed resistance to specific toxins, allowing them to survive in environments where other species cannot. For example, some snake species possess immunity to their venom, enabling them to prey on venomous snakes without suffering the lethal effects of their toxins. 3. Behavioral adaptations: These adaptations involve changes in an organism's behavior to increase the chances of survival and reproduction. Examples of behavioral adaptations include: - Foraging strategies: Many animals have adapted their foraging strategies to find food efficiently. For example, some predators hunt cooperatively in groups, allowing them to corner and catch prey more effectively. - Mating techniques: Organisms have evolved various mating techniques to maximize their reproductive success. For example, male peacocks show off their bright plumage and perform elaborate dances to attract females. - Migration: Some animals, such as birds and whales, undergo long migrations to find suitable habitats for breeding or to exploit seasonal food sources, increasing their chances of survival. In summary, adaptations are essential characteristics of organisms that help them survive by allowing them to effectively respond to the challenges posed by their environment. These adaptations may be structural, physiological, or behavioral and have been shaped by the process of natural selection over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I bought it, I was told it would bloom and the sweet smell would fill my office. I had the plant for two months, and every day I looked at it, but there weren't any flowers or pleasant smell. I was not happy, so I gave the plant to my friend Linda. One day, another friend Mary called and invited me to her office. When I walked in, her jasmine flowers surprised me. I reached out to touch the flowers. Mary cut some and gave them to me. I couldn't help smelling them. Surrounded by the sweet smell of only a handful of these flowers, I suddenly understood something. Mary bought her plant the same time I did. It took a year for her jasmine to bloom. I was so impatient for mine to bloom; regretfully, I gave it away. In a way my life is like the jasmine plant. I need to be patient and let things happen. Last Sunday Linda told me that she was going abroad the next week. Before she left, she returned the plant to me. This time I am going to wait.

He was serving a 17-year sentence for robbery by force. The fugitive investigation for Stackowitz gained momentum when Georgia Department of Corrections investigators assigned to the U.S. Marshals Service Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force (SERFTF) conducted a comprehensive investigation into the fugitive case and uncovered a possible alias identity for the fugitive. Investigators then discovered an address in Sherman, Connecticut, which was linked to the alias. U.S. Marshals in the District of Connecticut acted upon this information and were able to locate and arrest Stackowitz without incident. Stackowitz is currently being held in a Connecticut jail facility awaiting extradition to Georgia. Since its inception in 2003, investigations carried out by the SERFTF have resulted in the apprehension of more than 20,000 violent fugitives in the state of Georgia. Of these arrests, more than 1,100 were fugitives wanted for homicide. The successful initiative is led by the U.S. Marshals Service and combines federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The SERFTF has offices in Atlanta, Macon, and Savannah that cover the entire state of Georgia.

She was 19 yrs older than me and had been living in Colorado since I was young. I was born and raised in N.J. I did not see her she did not come to see us. I was grown, married, had children and was living in FL. when she showed up at my door with her husband. I was shocked since we never heard from her and I did not know she even knew where I lived. She stayed all of about 20 minutes, just long enough to very unpleasantly state that “my father is NOT your father and I am NOT your sister!” I always wondered why my mom hated me SO much, I found out that both my mom and “dad\\" were having affairs while married and both had children by someone else. I have never met my birth father (to my knowledge) only know his name, but understand that he was the father of my supposed half-brother (which would make him my only whole sibling out of seven siblings.) Obviously my oldest “half-brother\\", who is 20 yrs older than me, is not actually related to me either.

The men, Mondello (Don Orlando) and Verrico (George Khoury), row out to the site and pull two space travelers from the capsized craft before it shudders and sinks into the sea. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Major General A. D. McIntosh (Thomas Browne Henry) discovers that the government's missing spacecraft, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder (William Hopper), has been located off the coast of Italy. As McIntosh flies to Italy, Pepe (Bart Braverman), a little boy who lives in the fishing village of Gerra, finds a metal capsule that has washed up on the beach. Upon opening the capsule, he finds a jelly-like glob inside and sells it to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia), a visiting zoologist who is studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's medical-student granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) is summoned to town to take care of the injured Calder and his companion, Dr. Sharman. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds Sharman in the last throes of the fatal disease that decimated his crew. That night, after Marisa returns home to the trailer that she shares with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the glob and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size, and McIntosh arrives in Gerra, accompanied by government scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with Calder and Signore Contino, a representative of the Italian government. As Leonardo and Marisa hitch up the trailer containing the creature to their truck and head for Rome with their discovery, McIntosh informs the astonished Contini that Calder has just returned from Venus. Calder's spacecraft, crippled by a meteor, carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn species of animal life from the planet.

Information: - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas. - Historical regions (or historical countries) are delimitations of geographic areas for studying and analysing social development of period-specific cultures without any reference to contemporary political, economic or social organisations. The fundamental principle underlying this view is that older political and mental structures exist which exercise greater influence on the spatial-social identity of individuals than is understood by the contemporary world, bound to and often blinded by its own worldview - e.g. the focus on the nation-state. Definitions of regions vary, and regions can include macroregions such as Europe, territories of traditional states, or smaller microregional areas. A geographic proximity is the often required precondition for emergence of a regional identity. In Europe the regional identities are often derived from the Migration Period, but for the contemporary perspective are related to the 1918-1920 time of territorial transformation, and another in the post-Cold War period. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Classical Armenian (\\"grabar\\", Western Armenian \\"krapar\\", meaning \\"literary [language]\\"; also Old Armenian or Liturgical Armenian) is the oldest attested form of the Armenian language. It was first written down at the beginning of the 5th century, and all Armenian literature from then through the 18th century is in Classical Armenian. Many ancient manuscripts originally written in Ancient Greek, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac and Latin survive only in Armenian translation. - Movses Kaghankatvatsi ( Armenian : Movses Kaankatvaci ) , or Movses Daskhurantsi ( Movses Dasxuranci ) is the reputed author ( or authors ) of a tenth - century Classical Armenian historiographical work on Caucasian Albania and eastern provinces of Armenia , known as The History of the Country of Albania ( , Patmutiwn Auanic ) . - Western Armenian (Classical spelling: , \\"arevmdahayerên\\") is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Eastern Armenian. Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the Armenian diaspora communities around the world. As a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian at less than one million. - Albania (Latin: ', Greek: , in Old Armenian: \\"Auank\\" (\\"Aguank\\"), Parthian: \\"Ardhan\\", Middle Persian: \\"Arran\\"); usually referred to as Caucasian Albania\\"' for disambiguation with the modern state of Albania (the native name for the country is unknown), is a name for the historical region of the eastern Caucasus, that existed on the territory of present-day republic of Azerbaijan (where both of its capitals were located) and partially southern Dagestan. Around the first centuries BC and AD the land south of the Greater Caucasus and north of the Lesser Caucasus was divided between Kolchis in the west, Caucasian Iberia in the center and Caucasian Albania in the east. To the southwest was Armenia and to the southeast Atropatene. - The Armenian language (\\"\\") is an Indo-European language spoken by the Armenians. It is the official language of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. It has historically been spoken throughout the Armenian Highlands and today is widely spoken in the Armenian diaspora.

The country has a coastline on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea to the west and the Ionian Sea to the southwest where the Albanian Riviera begins. Albania is less than from Italy, across the Strait of Otranto which connects the Adriatic Sea to the Ionian Sea. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD).

Multiple problems are highlighted in the review, which demonstrates that there are various issues with the quality and functionality of the product. The issues mentioned include: a. Insecure gooseneck at the base that won't stay tightened. b. Broken shade collar on both lamps purchased, making it difficult to position and secure the shade. c. The plastic guard around the rim of the shade falling off frequently. d. The magnetic base shifting due to even slight machine vibration. 4. The reviewer characterizes the product as having the poorest engineering and quality control they have ever seen, which implies that they have used other products by Grizzly, or similar products by other manufacturers, with better engineering and quality control. 5. The review concludes by mentioning that the poor quality of this product is surprising, considering the usually very high quality they have come to expect from Grizzly. This statement further reinforces that the reviewer's negative experience is directly related to this specific product and does not reflect their overall opinion of Grizzly products.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I know that the answer to the question \\"What did the French adopt post-revolution that was created during the revolution?\\" is in \\"The year 1789 brought the French Revolution and with it the first division of Alsace into the départements of Haut- and Bas-Rhin. Alsatians played an active role in the French Revolution. On 21 July 1789, after receiving news of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris, a crowd of people stormed the Strasbourg city hall, forcing the city administrators to flee and putting symbolically an end to the feudal system in Alsace. In 1792, Rouget de Lisle composed in Strasbourg the Revolutionary marching song \\"La Marseillaise\\" (as Marching song for the Army of the Rhine), which later became the anthem of France. \\"La Marseillaise\\" was played for the first time in April of that year in front of the mayor of Strasbourg Philippe-Frédéric de Dietrich. Some of the most famous generals of the French Revolution also came from Alsace, notably Kellermann, the victor of Valmy, Kléber, who led the armies of the French Republic in Vendée and Westermann, who also fought in the Vendée.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"Sure, based on the passage you've quoted, one key thing that the French adopted post-revolution, which was created during the revolution was the anthem \\"La Marseillaise\\". Composed by Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg in 1792, it became a revolutionary marching song and later was adopted as the national anthem of France. Another significant adoption that I noticed from the text is the first division of Alsace into the départements of Haut- and Bas-Rhin. This administrative division appears to be a product of the French Revolution and was continued post-revolution. Furthermore, the end of the feudal system is highlighted. It's indicated that the French Revolution put a symbolic end to feudalism in Alsace, a change that presumably stuck post-revolution. So, in summary, \\"La Marseillaise\\" anthem, the administrative division of Alsace, and the end of the feudal system are things that the French adopted post-Revolution, which were initiated during the Revolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"I'il see you later, I hope.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I'll see you later, I hope.\\" can be translated as \\"Uvidíme se později, doufám.\\" Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"I'll see you\\" - In Czech, this part of the sentence can be translated as \\"uvidíme se,\\" which is the future tense form of the verb \\"vidět\\" (to see) combined with the reflexive pronoun \\"se.\\" The verb \\"uvidíme\\" consists of the prefix \\"u-\\" and the verb \\"vidět\\" in its future tense 1st person plural form - \\"vidíme.\\" It implies that the action is a mutual experience, i.e., both parties will see each other. 2. \\"Later\\" - In Czech, the word for \\"later\\" is \\"později.\\" This adverb is derived from the adjective \\"pozdější,\\" which refers to something occurring at a later time. 3. \\"I hope\\" - The phrase \\"I hope\\" can be translated into Czech as \\"doufám.\\" It is derived from the verb \\"doufat\\" (to hope) in its 1st person singular, present tense form. The verb \\"doufat\\" expresses a desire or expectation that something will happen or turn out the way one wishes. So, putting all these components together, you get \\"Uvidíme se později, doufám,\\" which is a direct translation of \\"I'll see you later, I hope\\" in Czech. Remember that word order in Czech can be flexible due to the inflectional nature of the language, so even if you move some words around, the meaning usually remains intact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With 38 songs in the Top 10 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts, Diamond has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Neil Diamond has been touring around the world consecutively for 50 years. Neil Diamond 50 - 50th Anniversary Collection Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Diamond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family descended from Russian and Polish immigrants. His parents were Rose (nee Rapaport) and Akeeba \\"Kieve\\" Diamond, a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was stationed in the army. In Brooklyn he attended Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, along with classmate Barbra Streisand. They were not close friends at the time, Diamond recalls: \\"We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.\\" After his family moved he then attended Abraham Lincoln High School, and was a member of the fencing team. Also on the team was his best friend, future Olympic fencer Herb Cohen. For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar. When he was 16, and still in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish children in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. \\"And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs,\\" he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the \\"first real interest\\" he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful \\"frustrations\\". Diamond also used his newly developing skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success. He spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the Catskills resort area. There he first met Jaye Posner, who would years later become his wife. Diamond next attended New York University as a pre-med major on a fencing scholarship, again on the fencing team with Herb Cohen. He was a member of the 1960 NCAA men's championship fencing team. Often bored in class, he found writing song lyrics more to his liking. He began cutting classes and taking the train up to Tin Pan Alley, where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers. In his senior year, when he was just 10 units short of graduation, Sunbeam Music Publishing offered him a 16-week job writing songs for 50 a week (equivalent to about US405 per week, in 2017 dollars), and he dropped out of college to accept it. Where did he attend school?","completion":"Neil Diamond attended multiple schools during his educational journey.

Located in Central Texas along the Eastern edge of the American Southwest, Austin is the 11th most populous city in the United States and the 4th most populous city in Texas. It also ranks as one of the most populous state capitals, only coming in second to Phoenix, Arizona. Named after Stephen F. Austin, who is known as the \\"Father of Texas\\" and the republic's first secretary of state, Austin was created in 1839 and replaced Houston as the capital of Texas. It is also the southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States. Austin is known for its vibrant live music scene that boasts more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city. The city's music revolves around the many nightclubs on 6th Street and an annual film/music/interactive festival known as South by Southwest (SXSW). The city also has a prominent ballet, world-class museums, one-of-a-kind shopping and beautiful outdoor spaces, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival that takes place in Zilker Park. The city is also known for being a major center for high tech. Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at the University of Texas at Austin provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin's technology and defense industry sectors. The presence of companies such as Dell, IBM, Silicon Labs, National Instruments, 3M, Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Indeed in the city has led to significant growth and a strong economy. Austin was also selected as the site for the development of the new Texas State Capitol, completed in 1888, which is one of the most significant landmarks in the city. The building is made from red granite and stands as one of the symbols of Texas pride. From a geographical perspective, Austin is located near the Balcones Fault, which runs roughly from Dallas to San Antonio, making the eastern part of the city flat, whereas the western part and western suburbs include rolling hills on the edge of the Texas Hill Country. Because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil, parts of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms. Austin is also the cultural and economic center of the Greater Austin Metropolitan area, which is home to over two million people, making it the 30th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Austin's official slogan promotes the city as \\"The Live Music Capital of the World\\", a reference to not only its numerous musicians and music venues but also the long-running PBS TV concert series Austin City Limits. Thus, Austin, Texas is a city that is as diverse as it is historically significant, being rich in tech industries, musical culture, education, and a broad array of cuisines, making it a thriving hub of activity in the heart of Texas. It showcases a unique mix of old-world charm and modern sophistication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don't need to search outside to understand the answer.

Hypothesis: A woman sells bread at the Peruvian market. This statement provides us with the following information: 1. The seller is a woman. 2. The location is Peru. 3. The item being sold is bread. 4. The market setting is specified, which implies the presence of customers. Analyzing the two statements, we can observe the following: 1. Both statements confirm that the seller is a woman, establishing a similarity. 2. Both statements locate the sales in Peru, creating another point of similarity. 3. The items being sold differ. In the premise, the woman is selling crafts, while in the hypothesis, the woman is selling bread. This difference distinguishes the nature of the products being offered. 4. The presence of customers is implied in both statements, although the hypothesis specifically mentions the context of a Peruvian market. In conclusion, while there are similarities between the premise and the hypothesis, such as the gender of the seller and the location of sales, the item being sold is substantially different.

Movie title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in.

While this is normally true, it is more important that children learn to take responsibility for what they need to do. As a child who strives to be your best, you need to accept that there are things you have to do, for the benefit of yourself and others. The goal of being a good child isn’t really about giving your parents a little less grief (although they will welcome that). Good children learn qualities that will help them become happy, successful, “good” adults. For example, you need to take responsibility for doing your homework and completing your chores, without constant reminders or resistance. This will help you to become more self-motivated, self-sufficient, and successful in work and life as an adult. Every one of us (including adults) sometimes gets angry, frustrated, whiny, or stressed out. There is no way to deny or avoid these emotions, and it would be unhealthy to do so anyway. However, you can work on recognizing and managing your emotions more effectively. Learning to control anger is one of the most important lessons for children. When you feel anger welling up, simple steps like taking deep breaths, in the nose and out the mouth, and counting to five can help you calm and contain it. Then, you can think more clearly about what caused the anger and what you can do differently next time to manage it. Uncontrolled anger isn't always the cause of bad behavior, though. Sometimes kids act out when they are upset, sad, confused, or lonely. You might experience these emotions if you've been bullied in school, left out of a group activity, or rejected by a friend. When you feel down, talk to an adult you trust. If you can talk to your parents about your emotions, it can improve your relationship with them. There is no shame in seeking help from a counselor or other expert if you need it, though. “Good boys and girls tell the truth.” You may have heard this said to you, and it is usually true. But the bigger picture is that honesty is a key part of building relationships based on trust. This will benefit you as a child and as an adult. Healthy relationships require trust, and trust is built on honesty. You may want to lie to your parents in order to avoid punishment or avoid hurting their feelings. This usually doesn't work, though, and it will get in the way of developing a more mature relationship with them. No matter how upset parents may become when hearing the truth — you failed a test because you didn’t study, stole a candy bar from the store, made fun of a vulnerable classmate, etc. — they will also feel some pride in your choice to be honest. It is an important sign of growth and trust. Even the best kids make plenty of mistakes. It is part of growing up, and simply of being human. The important thing is what you do with your imperfections. Learning from mistakes is a sign of maturity and is sure to be appreciated by your parents. If you did poorly on a big test because of a lack of preparation, are you ready to accept the importance of studying? If you were grounded for talking back to your mother in public, do you now understand the importance of showing respect? When a thoughtful, maturing child makes such mistakes, she learns from them and moves forward better off for it. Even the most demanding parents will accept some mistakes from their children, especially if they are not repeated mistakes. All parents love seeing evidence of growth and maturity in their children. Learning from a mistake instead of repeating it is always a positive sign. Children who are seen as \\"bad\\" because of bad behavior often have trouble dealing with their problems in the proper way. Confusion and frustration often lead to bad decisions. But being able to recognize and solve problems puts you on a path toward self-reliance and confidence. Remember how proud your parents were when you put a puzzle together by yourself, or wrote your own name? Even when you learned to unlatch the kitchen cabinet and made a giant mess everywhere, there was probably some pride mixed in, because parents know the importance of self-reliance and problem solving skills in the adult world. For kids, problems often result from a conflict with another kid. For a kid-friendly guide to conflict resolution, consider visiting http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetailsKids.aspx?p=335&np=287&id=1521. Its problem-solving steps include: Understand. Let each person involved clearly express the problem as they see it. Avoid making things worse. Don't scream, insult, or take physical action against the other kid(s), no matter how upset you are. Stay calm and work through the problem. Work together. Explain how you feel about the conflict by saying something like \\"I feel angry when ...\\" or \\"I need to feel ...\\". Then listen carefully while the other children involved speak. Find the solution. Brainstorm different possible solutions together, and choose the one that best meets the needs of everyone involved. As we just discussed, learning to recognize and solve problems yourself is an important skill for kids (and adults). But, just as important is being able to recognize and accept when you need help dealing with a problem. It doesn't help you to \\"quit\\" on your math homework without trying to figure it out yourself. But it is also not useful to refuse to ask for help when you need it because you insist on doing everything yourself. No child (or adult) can solve every problem herself. Your parents want to give you assistance when you need it, and will see your willingness to ask as a positive sign. Don’t expect them to solve every problem for you, though — that is a sign of immaturity. How do you know when to keep trying to solve a problem yourself, and when to ask for help? There is no secret formula; you have to trust yourself to make the decision. Have you given the problem your best effort? Are you out of ideas for how to deal with it? If so, then it is probably time to ask for assistance.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Have you ever felt annoyed when left talking to yourself after your mobile phone battery runs out in the middle of a call? If yes, then here comes some good news. Scientists are now perfecting a way to recharge electrical equipment while on the move. Researchers from theprefix = st1 /Netherlands,FranceandPortugalannounced last week that they have developed very thin solar panels that can be put on clothes. They can also be added to furniture and rooftops. They change light from the sun into electricity. In about three years, you'll be able to wear a jacket that will recharge your phone as you walk. For camping fans, the development could lead to a tent which charges batteries all day so you can have light or music at night. The basic technology of wearable solar panels is the same as that used for traditional solar panels. Pairs of sheets of semi-conducting silicon are linked together to form the panel. But scientists made them much thinner by using different silicon. At one micrometre, they are of the same thickness as photographic film. \\"This technology will make it easier for people to use clean energy sources,\\" said a physicist in theNetherlandswho led the team of scientists. But the thin panels are not as efficient as the thicker ones. While some solar panels now operate at an efficiency of about 20 per cent, the new flexible panels are only 7 per cent efficient. But the thinner panel is cheaper. An A4 sized panel put onto the back of a jacket cost less than US13. It could charge a cellphone during a summer walk in the countryside. As long as you stay within range of the transmitting masts that relay a call to the networks, phones will never again run out of power. Question: Which of the following is TRUE about the electrical equipment? Options: A: It can only be used while camping. B: You can listen to some music on it.

Here is a premise: The major values included in the Legal Services Plan Here is a hypothesis: A legasl services plan is not a major value Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise holds true. To understand why, let's first analyze the premise and the hypothesis in depth. Premise: The major values included in the Legal Services Plan This statement implies a discussion about the significant values or benefits provided by a legal services plan. A legal services plan refers to a pre-paid plan or legal insurance that covers certain legal services and helps individuals access legal assistance affordably. A Legal Services Plan may include a variety of values, such as: 1. Affordability: Legal services plans often provide affordable access to legal assistance, allowing individuals or businesses to pay a monthly or annual fee in exchange for coverage of specific legal issues. 2. Access to Legal Professionals: These plans typically include a network of qualified attorneys and legal professionals who are available to provide guidance, advice, and representation. 3. Wide Range of Services: A legal services plan may cover various legal matters such as family law issues, estate planning, criminal defense, business law, and others. 4. Preventive Law: Legal services plans can also provide assistance in preventing legal problems, like creating contracts and estate planning, by helping individuals avoid potential legal issues before they arise. 5. Peace of Mind: Legal services plans often provide peace of mind, knowing that legal assistance is accessible and affordable if and when it is needed. Hypothesis: A legal services plan is not a major value This hypothesis states that a legal services plan does not hold significant value or benefit. It is important to note that this hypothesis seems to contradict the premise directly, as the premise highlights the major values included in the Legal Services Plan. Now, let's look at whether the truth in the premise leads to the truth in the hypothesis. Given the premise, we understand the various values provided by a legal services plan. If we accept that these values are accurate and significant, it implies that a legal services plan indeed has major value. Consequently, this contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that a legal services plan is not a major value. In conclusion, it is not possible to accept that the hypothesis is true if the premise is also true, as the hypothesis contradicts the premise directly. Therefore, based on the given premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 3: Compare the premise to the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"Dublin is so spread out one must always charter a horse to reach an important site.\\" This suggests that the city is spread out, the important sites are far apart, and one needs a mode of transportation (in this case, a horse) to travel between them. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The premise suggests that the important sites in Dublin are within easy walking distance, while the hypothesis suggests the important sites are far enough apart that a horse is required for transportation.

You can predict the angle of the reflected light. Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place. They know the angle it will hit the side of the pool table.

Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-1990s emo scene, otherwise known as the \\"second wave\\" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as Green Day and Weezer before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of Japan and Europe. They founded Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label Vagrant Records. After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer Bob Weston of Shellac. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning. Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation. It was on that tour that the band met James Dewees, the new drummer for Coalesce while the bands were playing together in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a split 7-inch produced by Ed Rose entitled \\"The Get Up Kids / Coalesce\\". For the split, each band covered one of the other's songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of \\"Second Place\\", and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of \\"Harvest of Maturity\\". A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase. While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band. The Get Up Kids' announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including Sub Pop, Geffen and Mojo Records. The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label's insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band's income. Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record \\"Don't Hate Me\\" from Four Minute Mile for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was \\"the best that [they could] write\\". Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based Vagrant Records.

One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one. Who told the other coworkers about the shooting? A. the police detective B. The author's co-worker C. not enough information D. The author The answer to this question is:","completion":"B.

Here is a news article: The younger brother of Baltimore Police Department spokesman T.J. Smith is among the most recent victims of the city's escalating homicides. Dionay Smith, 24, was found fatally shot at around 8 p.m. Sunday in his home in the 1400 block of Argyle Ave. in the Upton neighborhood, Baltimore Police Lt. Jeremy Silbert said. He was the 173rd person to be killed in Baltimore this year. His older brother went public with his own grief in a Facebook post and in an interview with a Sun reporter. \\"I'm a public person, and this brings everything that I've been talking about full circle,\\" T.J. Smith said in the interview. \\"My brother was a good kid. I know that's a cliche, but it's true,\\" he said. \\"My only hope is that every time I speak out it mobilizes more people in our city to fight violence. No one else's family should ever have to get this phone call.\\" In the 48 hours after Dionay's death, there were at least three more homicides in Baltimore: Malcolm Parker, 47; Charlie Stevenson, 54; and Ronnie Banks, 56, bringing the total of deaths in 2017 to 176. As part of Smith's job, he is notified of every homicide in the city. In the interview, he described his shocked disbelief when he recognized his brother's name. \\"One of the names I heard was way too familiar,\\" he said. \\"My brother is the only person I've ever known with the name Dionay. My stomach sank to the floor. Like many people who have been in that position, I was in denial. I immediately contacted investigators to learn more about the Dionay who was found deceased from a gunshot wound. I also called his cellphone several times. Of course, there was no answer.\\" There have been no arrests, Silbert said. But police released surveillance video of two men entering the building where Dionay Smith lived. One appears to be carrying a gun. T.J. Smith believes that his brother knew his assailant. \\"He was targeted,\\" T.J. Smith said. \\"A coward with a gun entered my brother's apartment and shot and killed him.\\" The Baltimore Police Department issued a brief statement of support for T.J. Smith and his family. \\"The Baltimore Police Department family extends it's condolences and prayers to Chief T.J. Smith following the loss of his beloved brother, Dionay,\\" the statement said. \\"We join the rest of our city as we afford T.J. and his family privacy during this difficult time.\\" T.J. Smith said that his brother, the father of three toddlers, worked two jobs to support his family and volunteered his time in the Kids Safe Zone, which provides a safe setting in which children can play. Dionay Smith's children — two boys and a girl, all 2 years old — had spent the day at their father's home, but left a short time before he was shot, T.J. Smith said. \\"He was really good-hearted,\\" T.J. Smith said. \\"He had defied a number of odds, and he was doing every single thing he could to do the right thing.\\" Despite a significant age difference, the brothers were close, T.J. Smith said. They talked frequently, bantering back and forth as brothers do. The younger brother idolized the elder, and made no secret of it. \\"I still looked at him as a kid,\\" T.J. Smith said. \\"But I was proud of him, and I know that he was proud of me.\\" He chuckled when he recalled a recent post on Instagram in which his brother reacted with humorous indignation to what he perceived as an official misstep. \\"He posted on Instagram that he was going to run for mayor,\\" T.J. Smith said. \\"That was the thing about Dionay.

(CNN) -- An explosive century from birthday boy Ross Taylor helped New Zealand crush Pakistan by 110 runs and go top of their group at the Cricket World Cup. Taylor hit an unbeaten 131 off just 124 balls as the Kiwis smashed an incredible 100 runs off the final five overs of their innings. New Zealand looked set to post a modest total as they labored to 164-4 with ten overs remaining but fireworks from Taylor -- who hit seven sixes -- and Jacob Oram saw them amass 138 more runs. Finishing on 302-7 off their 50 overs the Kiwis shell shocked Pakistan, who contributed to their own downfall with sloppy fielding and poor bowling.

Write an article based on this summary: – With a growing number of people quitting soda, Coke and Pepsi have been venturing more into energy drinks, craft sodas, and milk, in an effort to boost sales. That's left room for smaller brands like LaCroix to enjoy huge success with sparkling water. LaCroix sales have jumped 45% since last year to an estimated 175 million, reports Bloomberg. Sales of other fizzy waters like Perrier and San Pellegrino have also spiked recently, while Sparkling Ice sales jumped from 27 million in 2010 to 550 million last year, the Washington Post reported. But big brands like Coke and Pepsi aren't having as much success. Whereas the market share for LaCroix maker, National Beverage—the fourth-largest soda maker in North America—rose 67% from 2010 to 2014, Coke and Pepsi's market shares fell 4% and 5.5%, respectively. Why are people attracted to a neon can that looks like it came straight out of the 1980s? A major advantage is that it avoids corporate associations, notes Bloomberg. Then there are the flavors—12 in total including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse (grapefruit), per Grist—which have attracted a kind of indie cult following. National Beverage says the flavors are based on a secret brew of \\"natural essence.\\" But for one young consumer, who used LaCroix to help kick his energy drink and soda habit, \\"it's less about the taste\\" and \\"more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing and it can replace soda.\\" LaCroix—which got a \\"letter of recommendation\\" in the New York Times Magazine in March—is certainly marketing itself as a soda alternative. It's latest flavor: cola. Article:","completion":"The Changing Face of Beverages: How LaCroix Found Success by Embracing the Sparkling Water Trend In a world where consumers have become increasingly health-conscious, traditional soda giants like Coke and Pepsi are facing a decline in sales, prompting them to expand their product offerings. Tapping into the energy drink sector, milk, or even exploring the world of craft sodas, these behemoths are working to recover lost sales and maintain their market share. However, amidst this shift, smaller independent brands like LaCroix are thriving in the race for consumer affection, particularly in the sparkling water market. A glance at the sales figures is enough to illustrate the remarkable growth LaCroix has achieved: in 2015, sales shot up by 45% to an extraordinary 175 million, as reported by Bloomberg. Other sparkling water brands, such as Perrier and San Pellegrino, have also seen a spike in sales recently. A prime example is Sparkling Ice, which experienced skyrocketing sales growth, going from 27 million in 2010 to a staggering 550 million in 2015, as highlighted by The Washington Post. In contrast, big brands like Coke and Pepsi have not been as successful with their sparkling water offerings. An analysis of 2010 to 2014 data revealed that both companies suffered a reduction in market share, 4% for Coke and 5.5% for Pepsi. In stark contrast, the market share for LaCroix's parent company, National Beverage - the fourth-largest soda maker in North America - rose an impressive 67% during the same period. So, what gives LaCroix its glowing edge in the world of sparkling water? For starters, its unique design: a neon-lit can that screams Eighties nostalgia yet manages to feel modern. One critical contributing factor to its success is clever marketing that detaches itself from established corporate associations. Furthermore, LaCroix offers a wide range of flavors that target a variety of customer segments, totaling 12 flavors, each displaying unique taste profiles. The flavors, including lemon, lime, apricot, and pamplemousse (grapefruit), boast a \\"natural essence\\" derived from a secret recipe that has piqued consumer curiosity and cultivated a devoted following. National Beverage's artful approach has resulted in LaCroix establishing itself as an alternative to traditional soda, a shining example being its latest flavor offering - cola. For many consumers, the fizzy sensation of LaCroix products carries tremendous appeal, emphasizing the ability to \\"replace soda\\" rather than directly competing with it. One young consumer, who relied on LaCroix to help him overcome his energy drink habit, says \\"it's less about the taste\\" and \\"more about how it's an interesting fizzy thing,\\" highlighting the niche that LaCroix has successfully filled in the market. Evidently, LaCroix's prosperity can be attributed to its unique branding, offering various flavors, and positioning itself as a fresh alternative to conventional sodas. Its meteoric rise among health-conscious customers demonstrates the industry-wide shift towards healthier, fizzy beverages. As LaCroix continues to bask in success and accolades - including a recent \\"letter of recommendation\\" in the New York Times Magazine - it remains to be seen if this will serve as a wake-up call for the soda industry giants to pivot and bring more originality to the table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Paragraph: Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people.

Review: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 out of 5 stars) I've been using the com.google.android.stardroid app for quite some time now, and I must say that it has completely transformed my stargazing experience. As an astronomy enthusiast, this app has provided me with a vast array of features that have greatly enhanced my understanding and enjoyment of the night sky. One of the most valuable aspects of the app is its accuracy and depth of information, which allows me to quickly and easily identify numerous celestial objects such as planets, stars, and constellations. The app's user interface is incredibly intuitive, and even as a beginner, I was able to navigate through it with ease. The design is sleek and aesthetically pleasing, making it a joy to use. What I also love about this app is the real-time sky mapping feature, which helps me track the movement of celestial objects as they appear in the sky. This is especially useful during meteor showers and other astronomical events, as it ensures I never miss a moment. The augmented reality feature is a true game-changer. Seeing the constellations and planets superimposed over the actual sky is a breathtaking and immersive experience. Furthermore, the app's customization options allow me to tailor my stargazing experience to my preferences. I can choose the level of details displayed on the screen, adjust the brightness, and even toggle on/off the sounds. Additionally, the app offers an offline mode, which is perfect for when I venture into more remote areas where internet connectivity may be limited. Lastly, I must commend the development team on their consistent updates and improvements to the app. This truly reflects their dedication to providing users with the best possible experience. Overall, I highly recommend the com.google.android.stardroid app to anyone looking to explore the beauty of the night sky.

Question 2: \\"Would you use a robot chef to save time cooking?\\" This question is asking if the respondent would consider using a robot chef specifically for the purpose of saving time while cooking. The focus is on the potential time-saving benefit of using a robot chef. Now, let's analyze the meanings to determine if the questions have the same meaning: While both questions involve the use of a robot chef, they are not exactly the same. Question 1 is about choosing between a human chef and a robot chef, whereas Question 2 is about using a robot chef specifically for its time-saving benefits.

Movie title: Transformers: Dark of the Moon Context: During the final days of the war that devastated the planet Cybertron, a spacecraft known as The Ark attempted to escape. Piloted by the great Autobot leader named Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy), the ship was said to contain special items that could help the Autobots win the war over the Decepticons. However, the ship was hit by enemy missiles, and the ship and its crew were lost into the far reaches of space.In 1961, the crash of the Ark on the moon is detected by NASA. Fearing that the Russians may beat them to finding out what this unidentified object is, President John F Kennedy pushes for NASA to land men on the moon to investigate. 8 years later, in 1969, Apollo 11 lands on the moon, and astronauts Neil Armstrong (Don Jeanes) and Buzz Aldrin (Cory Tucker) secretly explore the craft. They return with samples and pictures, and future moon missions bring back more information, before the manned moon missions are cancelled.In the present day, The Autobots are still working with the NEST Team to track down Decepticons loose on the planet, as well as anything unusual. While the Autobots Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Enzo, and Que attempt to take out an illegal Middle-Eastern nuclear plant, Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is informed by a Ukranian official, Alexi Vokshod, about something strange going on around the Chernobyl disaster site. Lennox leads a team along with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) into the radioactive site. Inside the plant, Prime discovers a fuel cell from the Ark, and something even more shocking: the Decepticon Shockwave (Frank Welker) and a giant drilling robot at his command. After a short fight, Shockwave and the driller retreat. During the battle, a Decepticon assassin, Laserbeak (Keith Szarabajka), ambushes Vokshod kills him.Eventually, Prime and the other Autobots return to NEST's headquarters.

Answer:","completion":"In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the second-in-command to the Decepticon leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving) is the cunning and ruthless Starscream (Charlie Adler). Starscream is a skilled fighter and tactician, often taking on leadership roles within the Decepticon ranks when Megatron is absent or incapacitated. However, his ambition and desire for power often lead him to undermine Megatron's authority, plotting to overthrow him and take his place as the Decepticon leader. Throughout the film, Starscream works alongside Megatron and other notable Decepticons such as Shockwave, Laserbeak, and Soundwave (Frank Welker) in their efforts to defeat the Autobots and claim victory for the Decepticons. Starscream's abilities as a fighter and his unyielding loyalty to the Decepticon cause make him an invaluable asset to Megatron's plans and a constant source of tension within the ranks of the Autobots. As the events of Transformers: Dark of the Moon unfold, Starscream continues to support Megatron in their quest to outmaneuver and defeat the Autobots, engaging in various battles and pursuing the powerful artifacts from The Ark. Ultimately, Starscream meets his demise at the hands of the human protagonist, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who uses a powerful grappling device to attach an explosive to Starscream's body, causing him to explode and perish. In conclusion, Megatron's second-in-command in Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Starscream, who plays a pivotal role in the Decepticons' plans and continuously proves to be a formidable adversary to the Autobots. His cunning tactics and fierce ambition make him a powerful force in the ongoing battle between these two factions and a key figure within the Decepticon hierarchy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a blacksmith's shop, the blacksmith uses tools like hammers, anvils, and tongs to heat, forge, shape, and join metals to create the desired object. Let's examine the other options: - Jail: A jail is a place for holding individuals who have been arrested, are awaiting trial, or have been sentenced to serve a short-term sentence. It is not a suitable location for manufacturing stool legs. - Internet Cafe: An internet cafe is a place where customers can use computers with internet access, often for a fee. It is primarily a place for online activities, such as browsing, gaming, and communication, and it is not equipped for the production of stool legs. - Building: A building, in general, could refer to any structure with a roof and walls, including residential homes, offices, or commercial facilities. While it is possible that a building could house a workshop or factory for making furniture parts, the term \\"building\\" itself is too vague to be the correct answer. - Bar: A bar is an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages, often with accompanying food and entertainment. While bars may have stools for customers to sit on, they are not involved in the actual production or manufacturing of the stool legs.

These nightly narratives stir up a cacophony of emotions, ranging from joy to fear and everything in between. Interestingly enough, our dreams have the potential to open doors to our subconscious and offer insights into our inner selves. One effective way to harness this wellspring of information is by keeping a dream journal. In this article, we will discuss why and how to keep a dream journal, as well as the benefits it offers for your personal growth. Step-by-Step Approach to Keeping a Dream Journal 1. Place your dream journal next to your bed: To ensure you remember as much of your dreams as possible, keep a dedicated journal and a pen on your bedside table, within easy reach. This setup encourages you to record your dreams right away, maximizing the chances of retaining crucial details while they are still fresh in your mind. 2. Upon waking, keep your eyes closed: As you wake up, fight the urge to open your eyes and move about. Instead, keep your eyes closed and remain as still as possible to retain your connection to your dreams. 3. Remember and record: Try to recall your dreams, replaying them in your head and focusing on any images, emotions, or sensations that stand out. Once you have a vivid recollection, open your eyes and begin recording what you remember, jotting down even the most minor details. Write in the present tense to help maintain the immediacy of the dream. 4. Avoid creating a plot: Dreams can often be disjointed and enigmatic. When recording your dream, refrain from constructing a linear plot or cohesive storyline if none is apparent. Simply describe the events, emotions, and impressions as they occurred, and resist the temptation to make assumptions or fill in gaps. 5. Don't interpret the dream while recording: During the initial documentation process, focus solely on capturing your dream in its purest form. Avoid assigning meaning or interpreting the events at this stage. This practice preserves the sanctity of the dream, allowing for a more genuine and accurate reflection when you revisit it later. 6. Title each dream: Properly categorizing and organizing your dream entries will aid you in identifying patterns, themes, and recurring symbols. Assigning an evocative and descriptive title to each dream can help you remember its unique elements and navigate your entries more efficiently. Benefits of Keeping a Dream Journal 1. Enhanced self-awareness: By regularly recording and revisiting your dreams, you are diving into the realm of your subconscious. This practice can lead to a deeper understanding of your emotions, desires, fears, and motivations, subsequently fostering personal growth and emotional resilience. 2. Improved problem-solving skills: Dreams can often present unique and imaginative solutions to real-life issues. Analyzing your dreams can provide fresh perspectives and possibilities, encouraging creative thinking and enhanced problem-solving abilities. 3. Strengthened memory and cognitive skills: The act of recalling and recording dreams can improve both your short-term and long-term memory. This habit demands mental and cognitive rigor, which ultimately helps in sharpening memory retention and concentration. 4. Increased emotional well-being: Confronting the emotions within your dreams promotes self-exploration and emotional healing. By addressing underlying feelings and unresolved issues, you can cultivate emotional well-being and a more balanced state of mind. Conclusion Embarking on a dream journaling journey can be an exciting and revelatory endeavor. Taking advantage of these nocturnal narratives offers a unique window into the depths of your subconscious and ultimately leads to self-discovery, personal growth, and heightened cognitive function.

SINGAPORE — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \\"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \\"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\\" \\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\\" The U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" Question: Where will the next summit be held?

The subject of the paper is abiotic stress. For his paper, he is analyzing two different forests of differing stress levels and writing about the differences seen in the environments. For the area with a low level of stress Henry chose the Narshe Forest, located near the mountains of Harkal. The area of high stress that Henry will be looking at is the Midgar forest. After choosing the two areas, Henry feels he deserves a break from his paper and goes to watch a baseball game. But I can use this background: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. What is an answer for this question: Will the animal population be higher or lower in the Midgar forest? A:","completion":"Given the background information on how abiotic stress affects biodiversity, it can be expected that the animal population will be lower in the Midgar forest compared to the Narshe forest. This is because the Midgar forest is described as having a high level of abiotic stress, which typically leads to reduced biodiversity and consequently lower animal populations. In contrast, the Narshe Forest has a low level of stress, resulting in higher biodiversity and animal populations. It is important to note that the relationship between abiotic stress and endangered species suggests that species in the Midgar forest are more likely to be population threatened, endangered, or even extinct due to the harsher abiotic stress conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: âLike a garden beset by blight, orchestras across the United States and Canada are under attack. Regardless of the plantâs age or hardiness, nearly every variety is affected.â So began a 2003 article in the Montreal Gazette on the state of symphonic affairs in North America. At the time, some 47 ensembles were in dire financial straits. Many well-regarded smaller orchestras in the U.S. were on the brink of closing (including the San Antonio and Tulsa symphonies) and even the most venerable and formerly rich ensembles (including two of the so-called âBig Fiveâ orchestras, the New York Philharmonic and the Cleveland Symphony) had to retrench. North of the border, the once-robust Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra had run up a debilitating 3-million deficit and the Toronto Symphony was reeling from a three-fold humiliation: in a cluster of events around the turn of the millennium, the ensemble nearly went bankrupt, the players walked out, as did the conductor, Jukka-Pekka Saraste; for a time, no suitable candidate could be found to take up the baton. In 2003, the experts agreed that an orchestral ice age was in the offing. They were wrong. âThree years ago, all around there were these sob stories — orchestras were complaining that everything was on the wane and dying,â says Bramwell Tovey, music director and conductor for the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. âWeâve turned a corner, though.â After more than a half-century of resolutely resisting change in the name of purism, our symphonies, with nothing to lose, began experimenting, and have largely succeeded in bulking up their audiences and making a start at balancing their books. Insiders remain edgy, worried about the future. They voice concerns about the efficacy of subscriptions (younger people tend not to book in advance) and the increasing scarcity of patrons willing to donate money and time to orchestras. But overall, the mood has become markedly more bullish in the orchestral world. Some have belatedly turned to technology, using live video during concerts and setting up internet chat rooms for their often amusingly rabid fans. Others are expanding their playlists to include, for example, the various Star Wars themes written by Canadian-based film composer John Williams, or putting on concerts with pop artists (as the VSO did in recent gigs with Jann Arden and Spirit of the West). Theyâre also offering pre- and post-concert discussions with audiences to make the experience less daunting to the uninitiated. In this time, even maestros with credentials from the oldest of old schools have given themselves makeovers, learning to downplay the hauteur that was their traditional stock in trade and transforming themselves into amiable hosts of an evening out. The change began quietly, almost a decade ago â before the crisis really erupted â at one of the nationâs oldest orchestras, the Regina Symphony. Their conductor and music director, Victor Sawa, started introducing the pieces to be played, sharing with concertgoers gossip about the composers, discussing the artistic movements that gave rise to the compositions in question and commenting on the music to follow (ânote especially the shift in mood when the cellos come inâ). This may not seem so revolutionary, but traditionally, the maestroâs job was simply to pace majestically onto the stage and conduct the pieces, not to coddle the audience with impromptu music appreciation lessons. âWeâve done a great job of selling a certain idea of classical in the last 100 years,â says Rob Gold, senior marketing manager at Ottawaâs National Arts Centre Orchestra. âThe vision is one with a dark and stormy maestro, grand soloists with flying capes and long white hair, and in the audience, furs and tuxedos.â The crowd of upper-crust habituÃ©s also knew what was required of them: that they worship politely, clap at the right moments (never between movements), donate generously (so as to see their names in the program) and dress snappily (to show their respect for the privilege conferred on them). The fastest baton in the east: Peter Oundjian conducts the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Courtesy TSO. No longer. At a spring concert by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, its new music director and conductor â Canadian-born, English-bred Peter Oundjian â introduced an evening of Viennese music by speculating idly on why the Austrian capital became the classical powerhouse it did in the 18th and 19th centuries. The crowd was noticeably younger than in days gone by, many taking advantage of the symphonyâs cheap-tickets-for-under-30s program. âPerhaps if Mozartâs father hadnât been so difficult, he wouldnât have left Salzburg for Vienna,â began Oundjian in his slightly English accent, an accent that still bestows cultural authority on its user. âIf Beethoven hadnât become so disillusioned with Napoleon,â he continued, âmaybe the composer would have left Vienna for France.â Little thought-provokers; nothing too heavy. Of the most challenging pieces on his program, he declared, âItâs not easy, not a quickly appreciated piece, but the orchestra just loves it.â With that intro, weâre left puzzling as we listen, trying to figure out what, precisely, these seasoned musicians admire about the piece. Oundjian is a man with the most blue-chip of classical educations (from Juilliard and Londonâs Royal College of Music); a former violinist with the world-renowned Tokyo Quartet, heâs trying to entice us, without condescension, into his world. Still, the indoctrination isnât always so painless. When asked what sorts of questions he has to field in post-show meetings with audiences, Tovey snorts, âItâs stuff like, why do all the violinists turn the page at the same time, what does the conductor really do, why are viola players playing bigger instruments than the violinists?â When I point my finger, that means a tympani solo: Conductor Bramwell Tovey. Courtesy Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. More revolutionary still than the pre- and post-concert talks (at least, in this traditionally reactionary sphere) are the technological experiments essayed by Tovey at the VSO. In an effort to bolster dipping attendance, two years ago the Vancouver ensemble (with the help of local film schools) introduced live video at several of their concerts. âThere were some glitches at first,â Tovey admits, on a break from a summer tour conducting the Luxembourg Symphony and the prestigious New York Philharmonic. âEarly on, we had a camera that inadvertently focused for a long time on my shoes.â But the glitches were soon corrected, and audience numbers for the video concerts have taken off. The screens show close-ups of performers during the performance and, for new compositions, often feature interviews with the composers beforehand. A former conductor of Londonâs Saddlers Wells orchestra and the Winnipeg Symphony, Tovey remembers a particularly effective use of the screens. âWhen the violinist Vadim Gluzman came to Vancouver in the fall of last year, he played the Tchaikovsky Concerto,â Tovey recalls. âThe [Stradivarius] that he plays used to belong to Leopold Auer, who was the violinist who played most of Tchaikovskyâs material but told Tchaikovsky that the concerto was unplayable. Everyone in the building wanted to look at the violin — the instrument so connected to the music — which they could, over the screens.â Conductor-violinist Pinchas Zukerman, one of the leading figures in the international classical music establishment, has also been an unlikely convert to the technology, using video screens for Ottawaâs National Arts Centre Orchestraâs habitually sold-out childrenâs concerts. Not everyone is a fan, however — the TSOâs Oundjian finds the live video, with its several seconds of delay, distracting for the players. As yet, no ensemble in Canada has gone as far as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which recently played a program of video-game music, displaying graphics above the troupe and speeches between sets by leading game creators. Let's do it for the kids: Conductor Pinchas Zukerman with the National Arts Centre Orchestra. Courtesy National Arts Centre. Concerts for children, like those offered at the NAC, have also become commonplace across the country. Some troupes are considering going further along the get-them-while-theyâre-young road. Englandâs London Symphony Orchestra recently pioneered a set of hands-on workshops for babies and toddlers, and several Canadian ensembles are considering trying them out after seeing them in action at a conference held by the umbrella group, Orchestras Canada, in the other London â London, Ontario. âWhen I first heard that I needed to recruit 10 babies between six and 12 months of age for a hands-on workshop to be delivered by the visiting members of the London Symphony,â says Katherine Carleton, executive director of Orchestras Canada, âI thought, âGood God, what mayhem will break out.ââ But the babies behaved, shaking their rattles in time, learning about loud and soft, and moving to the music. âI have to believe theyâll grow up enjoying the music more,â Carleton says. âMost people who enjoy classical have that door opened sometime in their youth.â Again, this trend is getting its legs first out west — a high-rise developer near the VSOâs home, the Orpheum, has reserved two lower floors for a state-of-the-art education centre. But for all the positives, thereâs still some naysaying in the orchestral community. Some groups arenât yet out of the woods — this spring, the players with the Orchestre symphonique de MontrÃ©al walked out, leaving one of the nationâs top two groups (the OSM and the TSO share bragging rights) in limbo, at least until incoming music director Kent Nagano arrives next year. And Carleton is particularly concerned with whether the younger portion of the symphony audience will continue to support the symphonies beyond buying tickets. âThe new audiences,â she says, âtend to think of orchestras more as providers of entertainment than as charities. They donât see why they would give donations to the Toronto Blue Jays or to the Mirvishes or the Rolling Stones, so why give to symphonies.â Sheâs also worried about the change in listening habits. âHow do we deal with moving away from mass culture, with people looking for an increasingly personalized iPod-shuffle kind of approach?â she asks rhetorically. âI know some sophisticated music listeners who include classical music in their diet of songs going through their earphones on a regular basis, but in the context of an incredibly diverse array of music: electronica, world music, jazz. A lot of that music is just fantastic.â Still, in an unguarded moment, Carleton admits happier days are, for the present at least, here again for the orchestras. âThereâs this superstition in the orchestral community â if things are going really well, you never admit it.â Write a title for it.","completion":"Reviving the Symphony: How North American Orchestras Adapted and Thrived in the Face of Crisis"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony, PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start, and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes. The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation's most successful console in terms of units sold. Furthermore, PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start, and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series (regarding cross-platform games, Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006, although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed), and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360.

Gibson was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Can we draw the following conclusion? At least 10 people were in the movie ransom","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided and the list of main actors/actresses, we can draw the conclusion that there were at least 10 people in the movie Ransom (1996). Here, I will provide more details on the Ransom's storyline, the cast members, and accolades received by the film. The plot of \\"Ransom\\" revolves around a wealthy airline owner, Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), who faces the kidnapping of his son, Sean Mullen (Brawley Nolte). The kidnappers, led by Detective Jimmy Shaker (Gary Sinise), demand a 2 million ransom for Sean's safe return. Tom's wife, Kate Mullen (Rene Russo), is distraught by the abduction, and the couple initially cooperates with the FBI task force, led by Agent Lonnie Hawkins (Delroy Lindo). However, Tom decides to take a bold move and turns the tables on the kidnappers by offering the ransom money as a bounty on their heads. This high-stake gamble ignites a dangerous game of cat and mouse between Tom and the criminals. As mentioned earlier, the main cast of \\"Ransom\\" includes well-known actors and actresses, such as: 1. Mel Gibson as Tom Mullen 2. Rene Russo as Kate Mullen 3. Gary Sinise as Detective Jimmy Shaker 4. Brawley Nolte as Sean Mullen 5. Delroy Lindo as Agent Lonnie Hawkins 6. Liev Schreiber as Clark Barnes 7. Evan Handler as Miles Roberts 8. Donnie Wahlberg as Cubby Barnes 9. Lili Taylor as Maris Conner Note that this list only includes nine names. However, there are undoubtedly supporting characters, lesser-known actors, and extras who appeared in various scenes throughout the film, which can easily bring the total number of people involved in \\"Ransom\\" to well over 10. Furthermore, \\"Ransom\\" was a commercial success, grossing over 300 million against a 70 million production budget. In addition to Mel Gibson's Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor, the film received other nominations and accolades, including a BMI Film Music Award for James Horner's score and a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Gary Sinise). In summary, we can conclude that there were at least 10 people in the movie \\"Ransom.\\" The film featured a main cast of nine well-known actors and actresses, and it is reasonable to assume that there were other supporting actors and extras involved in the making of the film. Also, \\"Ransom\\" received notable recognition for its performances and became a commercial success under the direction of renowned filmmaker Ron Howard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: The posterior pituitary is an extension of what anatomical structure? A: Answer:","completion":"The posterior pituitary, also known as the neurohypophysis, is actually an extension of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is a small but crucial part of the brain. It plays an important role in many vital functions, such as releasing hormones and regulating body temperature, thirst, hunger, sleep, mood, sex drive, and the secretion of other hormones. It's located at the base of the brain, just above the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus is considered the control center for the pituitary gland. It sends signals to the pituitary to release or inhibit the release of hormones into the bloodstream. In essence, the hypothalamus is what directs the pituitary gland to do its job. The hypothalamus communicates with the anterior pituitary through blood vessels, sending it releasing and inhibiting hormones to control its activity. Now, the pituitary gland itself is divided into two parts: the larger anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) and the smaller posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). Despite being part of the same gland, these two sections function slightly differently and have different origins during fetal development. The posterior pituitary doesn't generate any hormones of its own. Instead, it serves as a storage and release site for hormones made in the hypothalamus, specifically oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (also known as vasopressin). These hormones are transported down axons that run from the hypothalamus directly into the posterior pituitary, through long fibers in the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract. So, when the posterior pituitary releases a hormone, it's actually distributing hormones that were created in the hypothalamus. In other words, it is an extension of the hypothalamus. It's sort of like a 'messenger' or 'mailbox' that delivers the 'messages' or 'mail' created in the hypothalamus to the rest of the body. This intimate connection between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary thus allows for seamless communication and coordination in the body's response to various stimuli."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lennon first met Yoko Ono on 9 November 1966 at the Indica Gallery in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit. They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire!

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration.

Choose the next sentence.Abu Usama appears to be in his late 20s. With a neat ginger beard and a rifle slung over his shoulder, he addresses fellow Muslims back in Germany from his new home in northern Syria. In a 9-minute video released by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), he explains that he took his name from Osama bin Laden, because \\"he hit the head of injustice, and he is the one who terrorized [the West] as they terrorized us. Since they did not stop doing this, we will treat them in kind.\\" He asks his audience: \\"Are you happy with your life in Germany? Going to the nightclubs and having female friends?\\" according to a translation of the video by SITE Intelligence. Many analysts expect retaliation would be against OPTIONS: - Abu Usama interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Denmark interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Europe interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - France interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Germany interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - ISIS interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Iraq interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Islamic State of Iraq and Syria interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Muslims interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Osama bin Laden interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - SITE Intelligence interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Syria interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - U.S. interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - West interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. - Western interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself.","completion":"Many analysts expect retaliation would be against Germany interests overseas, rather than the in homeland itself. This assumption is mainly due to Abu Usama's direct address to the German Muslim population, insinuating that Germany may be a prime target for ISIS's actions. By mentioning life in Germany, as well as his new home in northern Syria, he is drawing connections between the two locations, suggesting that Germany may be chosen as an immediate target for extremist groups such as ISIS. The fact that Abu Usama took his name from Osama bin Laden, the notorious al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attacks on the United States, further highlights the connection to terrorist activities targeting Western interests. By openly expressing admiration for bin Laden's actions, he is sending a clear message to other extremist groups and potential supporters that the goal is to disrupt and attack Western countries, such as Germany, that he perceives as being unjust to Muslims. Moreover, targeting Germany's interests overseas rather than within the country itself can be viewed as a strategic move by the extremist groups or ISIS. By doing so, they are able to instill fear and tension with a lesser risk of immediate retaliation from the German authorities or military. Furthermore, attacking German interests overseas may potentially catch Germany off-guard and less prepared in comparison to encountering such attacks on their homeland. Additional reasons for focusing on Germany's interests overseas may be due to the country's involvement in the Global Coalition Against Daesh, which aims to defeat ISIS through military actions, blocking financial resources, and countering the group's propaganda. This coalition's efforts directly impact ISIS operations, making Germany's involvement a possible motive for retaliation from the extremist group. In conclusion, considering the connections drawn between Germany and Abu Usama's message within the 9-minute video, along with the country's involvement in counter-terrorism efforts, it is likely that analysts would focus on potential retaliation against Germany's interests overseas. By choosing this strategy, extremist groups can project their power and influence while instilling fear and uncertainty within the Western society, all while minimizing the risk of direct confrontation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - alone - story book - herb garden - great outdoors - sky The answer is \\"great outdoors\\" because The answer is:","completion":"\\"great outdoors\\" because bees are naturally found in the diverse and expansive environments of the great outdoors. While bees can be encountered in various settings, such as herb gardens or even the sky, the great outdoors as a whole consistently provides these incredible creatures with their natural habitat. Bees have evolved to live and thrive in environments that offer diverse and abundant food sources. The great outdoors provides them with a myriad of flowers and plants, which are essential for their survival. By foraging for nectar and pollen from these plants, bees obtain the necessary nutrients to sustain their life cycles and build their hives. Moreover, bees play a crucial role in the great outdoors as pollinators. As they move from flower to flower in search of nectar, they inadvertently transfer pollen, which fertilizes plants, allowing them to reproduce. In fact, bees are responsible for pollinating around 80% of the world's flowering plants. This makes them indispensable for the overall health and biodiversity of many ecosystems. While herb gardens can often attract bees due to their abundance of flowering plants and delicious scents, they represent just a small fraction of the vast landscape where bees can be found. The great outdoors encompasses not only herb gardens but also forests, meadows, and countless other ecosystems teeming with plant life. These environments provide bees with the ideal habitat to carry out their daily activities and establish their colonies. The sky and story books may be associated with bees in some instances, such as when bees fly through the air to move from one plant to another or when they are depicted in books and illustrations. However, these options do not inherently reflect the natural habitat of bees, which is why they can be ruled out. Another option, \\"alone,\\" does not accurately represent the life of a bee since they are social insects known for their highly organized, cooperative colonies. Though it might be possible to find an individual bee foraging alone for a brief period, the hive is their natural residence within the great outdoors. In these colonies, bees work harmoniously together to perform tasks, such as caring for the queen and larvae, producing honey, and defending the hive from potential threats. In conclusion, bees are naturally found in the great outdoors, where they enjoy diverse plant life, which not only serves as their food source but also allows them to play their vital role as pollinators. From forests to meadows and other flourishing ecosystems, the great outdoors offers the perfect environment for bees to thrive, contribute to the balance of nature, and maintain the health of our planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many is the differencein the yards of the field goal made by Gostkowski and the yards of the TD pass to Bennet?","completion":"Well, dear kiddo, before we can answer this question, there's something we need first. That would be the actual numbers or yards of the field goal Stephen Gostkowski made and of the touchdown (TD) pass to Martellus Bennett. These numbers are not provided in the question, and they can vary from game to game. Keep in mind that a field goal in football is when the ball is kicked through the big tall 'Y' or 'U' shaped posts at the end of the field. This can be from varying distances, but typically, they are kicked from anywhere between 20 to 50 yards out. On the other hand, a TD pass is when a player throws the ball to another player who catches it in the endzone. This can also vary in distance, but is usually made from closer range, within the 20-yard line. To show you how to find the difference, here's a little example. Let's say, in this imaginary game, Gostkowski made a field goal from 45 yards out and Bennett caught a TD pass 15 yards away. The difference between the two would be calculated by subtracting the smaller number (Bennett's 15 yards) from the bigger number (Gostkowski's 45 yards). So the answer would be 45 - 15 = 30. So, in our pretend game, there would be a 30 yard difference between Gostkowski's field goal and Bennett's TD pass. Remember, we just used made up numbers for this example. The real numbers may be different depending on the game. We still need the actual numbers to give the real answer."},{"prompt":"Build a movie plot around this: Whom do Labiche and Didont meet Spinet.","completion":"Title: The Maestro's Heist Genre: Action/Adventure, Comedy, Mystery Plot Summary: In a world where the love for music is almost mythical, Bernard Labiche and Gustave Didont are small-time thieves whose heists are inspired by the great orchestrations of history. One day, they cross paths with the renowned and reclusive composer Armand Spinet who is in desperate need of their unique skills. Together, they uncover a secret society plotting to control the world through the power of music, and embark on a daring quest to save the world, all while discovering more about themselves along the way. Act I: Bernard Labiche and Gustave Didont are a duo of quirky burglars with a shared passion for classical music. They plan heists around the musical compositions that inspire them and have gained some notoriety and a criminal following. One night, as they drunkenly celebrate their latest successful robbery, they receive a mysterious message asking for their skills in an unexpected heist. Intrigued, they set up a meeting with the mysterious composer Armand Spinet, a genius musician who has disappeared from public life for a decade due to personal tragedy. Act II: At the meeting, Spinet reveals his true intentions: he has recently discovered a secret society called the Symphony, which uses rare and mystical musical instruments to manipulate the world's political and social events. The organization is led by a mysterious figure known only as the Maestro. Spinet admits that he was once a member of the Symphony but has become disillusioned with their intentions. He now seeks to dismantle their power by stealing these instruments, which are guarded in the Maestro's secret vault. Nevertheless, stealing the instruments is not an easy task. They must first decode a complex musical cipher, leading them through various obstacles and trials inspired by famous musical compositions. Along the way, they are pursued by the Maestro's enforcer, a skilled assassin named Timpani, who has a personal grudge against Labiche from a past heist gone wrong. Act III: As Labiche and Didont manage to decode the cipher and navigate the perilous obstacles, they eventually infiltrate the Symphony's secret fortress, only to find that the instruments are guarded by a small orchestra of brainwashed musicians playing a deadly melody that can manipulate minds. Didont, a gifted musician himself, manages to counter the melody using his own violin, breaking the spell over the guards and allowing them to confront the Maestro. In the climactic final battle, the Maestro uses his mastery of the mystical instruments to unleash powerful sound waves that threaten our heroes. With their combined expertise, Labiche, Didont, and Spinet destroy the instruments and defeat the Maestro, saving the world from the tyranny of the Symphony. In the aftermath, Labiche and Didont have a newfound appreciation for music, choosing to use their talents for good instead of crime. As for Spinet, his time with the thieves has helped him find renewed purpose and inspiration, and he returns to the world of music with a powerful new composition that incorporates elements from their shared adventure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Who might be supposed to portray Iphigenia' friends mourning? from the following article ? Though she did not again win the Sulman, she was successful in having works hung in that competition on many occasions, including the 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950 shows. Bellette continued to paint classical scenes, and around 1950 produced the work Chorus without Iphigenia. Purchased by the National Gallery of Australia in 1976, this oil painting shows five figures, \\"posed like statues in a tableau vivant, [and who] possess a kind of erotic energy\\". Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death. In 1951, Bellette came second in the Commonwealth Jubilee Art Competition, behind the young Jeffrey Smart. The following year, she won a competitive exhibition sponsored by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Girl With Still Life.Although Haefliger never critiqued his wife's exhibitions, others occasionally stepped in to provide reviews in the Herald.

Lose-lose for Democrats Democrats have reason to worry. It is easy to see how a defeat for the president on Syria will effectively bring his presidency to a standstill. But, honestly, even getting his way on Syria will make liberals unhappy. A presidential loss on a resolution for the use of force would be extraordinary. The rebellion by Democrats that would result in such a defeat would complete the humiliation for President Obama and deprive him of the ability to flail at Republican straw men. After a loss on the resolution, Republicans and Democrats alike would readily conclude that they don’t have much reason to follow the president’s lead for the remainder of his term. Like the foreign policy he has propounded, Obama would be perceived as weak, unimpressive and easily ignored. If he can’t persuade the country and/or Congress on matters of war and peace, how is he going to sway them on the budget or other domestic matters? His lame-duck status would be a given. If the resolution fails, those Democrats who went out on a limb on Syria to support the use of force would find themselves vulnerable, while those on the left who rejected the use of force would realize the president’s political survival is at odds with the progressive agenda; the president, they soon would recognize, can be sacrificed for the sake of the left. The dream-boat presidency would be in tatters, with the most liberal elements of the party ready to put Obama behind them. But if Obama wins then Democrats face a different set of problems. The sequester cuts on defense would prove difficult to sustain. How would they pay for Syria? The Republican leadership that backs the president would have shown some muscle and could beat the rap that they are rejectionists. Having put country before politics, they would be newly confident in any future face-off against Obama. And progressives would be mightily disappointed, seeing their political idol mimic President George W. Bush once again (as he has on drones and the NSA). Moreover, in a country newly engaged in military action — with left and right railing at the president — there may be little appetite for the president’s domestic agenda. This truly is a lose-lose for Democrats. Voting with the president sacrifices their own political standing with the left for very little, giving up on their “nation building at home” mantra; they’ll be shifting the nation’s agenda to war and endorsing American unilateralism. Abandoning the president on Syria, however, virtually guarantees the president’s collapse. Either way this works, out you can expect a segment of Democrats to give up on him, sending his poll numbers into Bush territory. All of this said, the president’s personal plea not to humiliate him domestically and internationally may keep sufficient numbers of Democrats on his side to pass the resolution. Those who see the horrible ramifications in the United States’ failure to act should hope he does guilt Democrats into standing by him. As for Democrats, sooner or later they must decide the fate of their post-Obama party. Syria will only hasten that process and, in all likelihood, and give a boost to the most liberal elements in the party (they’ll either be the aggrieved losers or triumphant in derailing a war). That’s good for the far left and for Republicans (if they can seize the center once again); it’s really bad for Hillary Clinton, who once again will find herself out of step with her party. What was this article about?","completion":"The article discusses the lose-lose situation for Democrats regarding President Obama's stance on Syria. If the president loses a resolution for the use of force, it will likely bring his presidency to a standstill and weaken his influence on foreign and domestic matters.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. This film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years. It is one of the few films, perhaps the only one, that actually gave me shivers: not even Pasolini´s Sálo, to which this film bears comparison, affected me like that. I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini, Fassbinder and others. I had to ask myself, what was it about the film that made me feel like I did? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film, but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. Typically, in a horror film, horrible and frightening things will happen, but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses, deserted hotels, castles, churchyards, morgues etc. This handling of the subject in horror is, I think, a sort of defence mechanism, a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer. So, from this perspective, Hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society, and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film. But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre, especially concerning the body and its violation, the stages of fright and torture it can be put through. What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday, middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression, loneliness, lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror, but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape. It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidl´s film resides. Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday, displays them in quotidian repetition, rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre. One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films, a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism, domination, desire, questions concerning ownership, sexual property and control, fascism and capitalism etc. Seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder; like this German ally, he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films. During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year, at which Seidl was a guest, he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated, subjugated women in Hundstage, but no instances of a woman fighting back, liberating herself. Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women, but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it. An artistic statement as good as any, I think. Thank you.

Apple Potpourri can be especially fun in large groups, as there will be more options for the judge to choose from. Apple Potpourri is a perfect alternative for groups where the judges tend to choose the most entertaining card combinations. ” To up the stakes of the game and keep things interesting, make each round count double. The judge will turn over two green cards instead of just one, and players will have to choose a red card that is best described by both of the terms on the green cards. This variation of the game forces players to think more carefully about each pay, as red cards has to be associated with two different terms, and rounds are worth two green cards. For the 2-For-1 Apples version of the game, you can decide whether the same number of cards is necessary to win, resulting in a quicker paced game, or whether to also double the number of green cards needed and only increase the difficulty of each round. What is a summary?","completion":"In summary, the article discusses various alternative ways to play the popular card game, Apples to Apples, to enhance the experience and make it more challenging and entertaining. These alternative versions include the \\"Crab Apple\\" version, where players select red cards that are opposite to the green card in play; the \\"Apple Potpourri\\" version, where players choose a red card before the green card is revealed, resulting in more random and amusing outcomes; and the \\"2-For-1 Apples\\" version, where each round counts double, making players think more carefully about their card choices. These variations aim to break the monotony of the standard game and provide a more engaging and enjoyable experience for players in different group settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer to this question? who won time's person of the year award in 1970?","completion":"In 1970, Time magazine awarded its \\"Person of the Year\\" title to Willy Brandt, the former Chancellor of West Germany. Brandt was recognized primarily for his efforts to improve relations between East and West Germany, as well as his work in fostering better diplomatic ties with the Eastern Bloc countries during the Cold War era. Willy Brandt was born Herbert Frahm on December 18, 1913, in Lübeck, Germany. He adopted the name \\"Willy Brandt\\" during the 1930s while living in exile from Nazi Germany. Brandt's political career was an impressive one, as he played pivotal roles in German and global politics for much of the mid-20th century. He started his political journey with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), eventually rising through the ranks to become the party's leader. During his tenure as the Chancellor of West Germany from 1969 to 1974, Brandt set in motion a series of diplomatic overtures that came to be known as \\"Ostpolitik.\\" This policy aimed to create a détente with the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies, as Brandt sought to ease tensions and create a foundation for a unified German nation. Some of the key components of Ostpolitik included the recognition of East Germany as a separate, sovereign nation, the establishment of diplomatic relations with other Eastern Bloc countries, and the signing of treaties aimed at enhancing cooperation and communication. One of the most significant outcomes of Brandt's efforts was the signing of the \\"Treaty of Moscow\\" in 1970 and the \\"Treaty of Warsaw\\" in 1971. Both agreements provided groundwork for mutual recognition, non-aggression, and the inviolability of borders in Europe. These treaties were a major factor in the eventual easing of Cold War tensions, leading toward improved international relations throughout the continent. The culmination of these efforts came in 1971 when Willy Brandt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless work in promoting European stability and unity. His leadership and diplomatic prowess made him an ideal choice as Time's \\"Person of the Year\\" in 1970, as the magazine sought to honor him for bringing the world significantly closer to peace and understanding during one of the most challenging periods in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Title: Best Translation Thus far Review: This Louise Varese version of Rimbaud's \\"A Season in Hell\\", in my opinion, is the best translation to appear in English, with the French on each opposing page, for Varese has nothing to hide. I feel that the recent translations to appear attempt to differ from the Varese version, in order to bring a more literal and therefore less poetic vision to this visionary poetry. Compare the opening page:\\"My Life was a Feast...\\" to the end of the pagewith any other version. The Varese version simply best convey's the spirit of the poem.When I read any other version, I actually find myself substituting Vareses' choices.Varese was the wife of avant-garde composer, Edgard Varese, the first to write electronic music.There is nothing electronic, or robotic, however, with regard to these translations.They are as fresh, still, as freshly-cut flowers.Robert Shapiro (author of \\"Les Six: The French Composers and Their Mentors Jean Cocteau and Erik Satie\\" published by Peter Owen in 2011) Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The review provided is primarily positive. The reviewer expresses their strong approval of the Louise Varese translation of Rimbaud's \\"A Season in Hell,\\" asserting that it is the best English translation they have encountered thus far. They appreciate the side-by-side presentation of the French and English texts, as it allows the reader to compare the original with the translation. The review argues that other recent translations attempt to deviate from Varese's version with the intention of creating a more literal rendering, which, according to the reviewer, compromises the poetic integrity of the visionary poetry. By comparing the opening page of Varese's translation with other translations, the reviewer highlights the superiority of Varese's version in capturing the spirit of the poem. Moreover, the reviewer points out the association of Varese with her husband, the avant-garde composer Edgard Varese, who was a pioneer in electronic music. They emphasize that her translation is neither mechanical nor robotic; instead, it is vibrant and alive, akin to freshly-cut flowers. In conclusion, the reviewer, Robert Shapiro, offers a positive and enthusiastic endorsement of Louise Varese's translation of Rimbaud's \\"A Season in Hell,\\" finding it to be the most poetic and faithful to the original work among the available translations."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Everyone was trying to hear the movie but Lee was talking too much.

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command.

Write a question about the following article: At the Battle of Nesjar, in 1016, Olaf Haraldsson won the kingdom of Norway from the Danes. It was at some time after Eirkr left for England, and on the death of Svein while retreating to Sweden, maybe intent on returning to Norway with reinforcements, that Erikr's son Hakon went to join his father and support Cnut in England, too. Cnut's brother Harald may have been at Cnut's coronation, in 1016, returning to Denmark as its king, with part of the fleet, at some point thereafter. It is only certain, though, that there was an entry of his name, alongside Cnut's, in confraternity with Christ Church, Canterbury, in 1018. This is not conclusive, though, for the entry may have been made in Harald's absence, perhaps by the hand of Cnut himself, which means that, while it is usually thought that Harald died in 1018, it is unsure whether he was still alive at this point. Entry of his brother's name in the Canterbury codex may have been Cnut's attempt to make his vengeance for Harald's murder good with the Church. This may have been just a gesture for a soul to be under the protection of God. There is evidence Cnut was in battle with pirates in 1018, with his destruction of the crews of thirty ships, although it is unknown if this was off the English or Danish shores. He himself mentions troubles in his 1019 letter , written as the King of England and Denmark. These events can be seen, with plausibility, to be in connection with the death of Harald.

DEVASTATED friends and family are mourning Hope Carnevali who died after Monday night’s thunderstorm asthma ­disaster. Ms Carnevali, 20, died in her family’s arms in front of their Hoppers Crossing home. It was reported she was a “lifelong asthma sufferer” and had a “severe attack” during the storm. An ambulance did not arrive until 31 minutes later. media_camera Hope Carnevali, 20, from Werribee, died after a thunderstorm asthma outbreak in Melbourne. Picture: Supplied The law student’s uncle, John Carnevali, said Ambulance Victoria should let people know if there were going to be long delays. “So maybe we can take them straight to hospital where it can save a life, because I’ve lost my niece, maybe for that reason,” he said in tears. A second person is also believed to have died after a perfect storm triggered hundreds of thunderstorm asthma attacks and plunged Melbourne’s hospitals into their busiest night. Victoria ran out of ambulances as emergency calls jumped 450 per cent, while several hospitals enacted disaster management plans. WHAT IS THUNDERSTORM ASTHMA? media_camera The stormfront hits the city. Picture: Norm Oorloff The perfect storm of a high pollen count, northerly winds and humid conditions triggered the rare phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma from 7pm on Monday, with emergency services receiving ­triple 0 calls every four to five seconds and Ambulance Victoria deploying 60 extra crews. More than 1870 calls for ambulances were made between 6pm and 11pm. AV regional services general manager Mick Stephenson said he was aware two people had died while waiting for ambulances but it was not known if the asthma ­phen­omenon was responsible. Mr Carnevali described his niece as a beautiful woman who died too soon. “She was a very kind-hearted, beautiful gorgeous little girl. She’d do anything for anyone,” he said. “If somebody needed her, she’d be there. She was an angel. We’re going to miss her so much.” Friends also paid tribute on social media. Erin Carlile said: “A beautiful soul taken away too soon.” Ashleigh Zammit wrote: “Fly high beautiful girl. ­Heaven has gained another angel.” Premier’s sons suffered ‘significant asthma attacks’ Premier Daniel Andrews expressed his condolences for the families of the two people who died during the thunderstorm asthma disaster. He promised a full investigation into what went wrong. “Our thoughts and our prayers and our best wishes are with the families of those two Victorians who had everything in front of them, and for those families to have to deal with this tragedy is desperately sad,” Mr Andrews said. “Our commitment to those families is we will learn from what has gone on here, we will make the necessary improvements.” The Premier said his two sons had suffered “quite significant asthma attacks” during Monday’s storm. Health Minister Jill Hennessy said claims that two people died while waiting for ambulances would be the subject of a full investigation. “No doubt, there will be lessons to learn, there always are in these cases, but every part of our emergency management surge occurred correctly,” Ms Hennessy said. Extra staff were brought into hospitals, the MFB increased its cap­acity to work as first responders and police conducted welfare checks, while private hospitals opened their emergency departments for public patients. Royal Melbourne Hospital ran out of Ventolin and spacers while the Royal Children’s Hospital had almost 500 emergency presentations. State health commander Paul Holman said this was a first in his 40 years in the job, calling it a “state disaster”. But the man who discovered the phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma in 1992, Deakin University’s Assoc Prof Cenk Suphioglu, said it could have been predicted. He said resources were needed to set up an alert system. media_camera The storm front near Torquay yesterday afternoon amid high winds and hundreds of lightning strikes.

Picture: Norm Oorloff While his Deakin AIRwatch website predicted this weather combination would trigger an extreme event, Assoc Prof Suphioglu said more resources were needed to set up an alert system. “If it is well resourced we can give alerts — how seriously they (emergency authorities) take those alerts will be up to them,” Assoc Prof Suphioglu said. “This is a well know thing. Melbourne is dubbed as not only the allergy capital of the world, but also the thunderstorm capital of the world.” Royal Melbourne Hospital’s director of Emergency Professor George Braitberg said they had to borrow Ventalin from neighbouring centres after seeing a day’s worth of patients in 12 hours. “There really wasn’t any warning,” he said. “Most people I saw weren’t asthmatics or hadn’t had it for 25 years. It was an extraordinary situation; the worse I’ve experienced in 30 years in the job.” St Vincent’s Hospital had to enact it’s emergency management plan reserved for disasters and set up a second six-bed emergency department in its day unit when it became overwhelmed with 216 presentations — more than double what sees on a typical night. Out of The Royal Children’s Hospital’s 500 emergency presentations — two and a half times the normal number off sick children — resulted in about 50 cases being admitted. “Just the sheer number of patients. it is unprecedented in our history,” RCH director of general medicine Dr Tom Connell said. “There will certainly be lessons learnt about dealing with demands, but it is hard to predict these and I think we have all coped very well by pulling together in a true team spirit.” media_camera Stacee Krepis was forced to drive Nicholas to the Royal Children's Hospital.

Stacee Krepis called 000 at 4am on November 21 after her son Nicholas, 11, had chest pains, and had struggled to breathe from about 6pm the night before. But when the paramedic arrived to her Coburg home in a station wagon shortly after, he urged Ms Krepis she needed to take Nicholas straight to the Royal Children’s Hospital while suffering from “Thunderstorm asthma”. “I rang the ambulance, but a paramedic came on his own, and when he saw Nicholas, he said yes, I needed to take him to the Royal Children’s straight away,” Ms Krepis said. But after a dash to the hospital, Ms Krepis was confronted with dozens of children in the waiting room, coughing and wheezing. “Looking at some of those kids in there, they were really struggling; it was really scary, especially seeing your child unable to breathe,” Ms Krepis said. Ms Krepis said when she finally got to see a doctor, he told her the “line was out the door with children with similar symptoms” by midnight. media_camera Chris Wookey had his first asthma attack last night. Picture: David Caird Perfect storm a rare event “THUNDERSTORM asthma” is a rare Spring event, which occurs when a thunderstorm, sudden change in humidity, a northerly wind change and high pollen count are combined. This perfect storm causes pollen “packages” to be blown from the north. The humidity change bursts these capsules, which explode tiny pollens at concentrations million times higher than what is usually in the air which irritate airways. People with mild asthma, or who have never experienced an asthma attack, are often most affected because they aren’t actively taking treatment or have management plans. Melbourne is the “thunderstorm” capital of the world; with epidemics recorded in 1987, 1989, and November 2010. Royal Melbourne Hospital’s head of respiratory medicine, Associate Professor Lou Irving said the event was a reminder to mild asthmatics that their condition could suddenly become severe and they needed an action plan and current medication. therese.allaoui@news.com.au ||||| At least four people have died after the sudden outbreak of \\"thunderstorm asthma\\", prompting an investigation into the emergency response to the medical crisis that swept across Melbourne on Monday. Forty-eight hours after the massive asthma event pushed the city's healthcare system to its limits, two more people were confirmed dead.

Photo: Jason South Noble Park father-of-two, Clarence Leo, and 35-year-old man, Apollo Papadopoulos, died after suffering asthma attacks that are believed to be due to the unprecedented weather event. As more information about the emergency response came to light on Wednesday - including details of after-hour clinics, doctors and pharmacies struggling to cope with a surge in patients - questions were raised about why a public warning was not sent out to asthma sufferers. Health Minister Jill Hennessy, who commissioned the Inspector-General for Emergency Management to review the emergency response, said the thunderstorm asthma event could not have been predicted, but that work was underway to create new models to anticipate the effect of extreme weather on health. \\"Unpredictable weather patterns and the impact on health I think is a new emerging frontier for public health risks,\\" she said.

Doctor Mark Hotusaid he arrived at 16-year-old Angelique's Altona home about 4am Tuesday after she had woken up \\"unable to breathe\\" and been turned away from hospital. He sent her back to hospital with a note for a doctor to see her immediately and she was finally admitted. On Wednesday morning, Ms Hennessy said there were two confirmed deaths - 20-year-old law student Hope Carnevali and Greenvale high-school student Omar Moujalled. But within hours, the grieving families and friends of two other men spoke of their loss after thunderstorm asthma struck. Mr Leo, a bouncer, was well known in Melbourne's nightclub scene. His business partner, Andrew Christodoulou, described him as a \\"gentle giant\\". Friend Danny Saddoo remembered Mr Leo as a doting father and husband and \\"a really lovely, kind-hearted man\\". He said he suffered a \\"massive\\" asthma attack at 4.30am on Tuesday and died before paramedics arrived. Mr Papadopoulos' sister, Bianca Becker, said her brother was \\"the best man you'll ever meet. We're devastated.\\" His mother, Emma Papadopoulos, said the \\"chaos\\" she witnessed at the hospital on Monday night was unlike anything she had ever seen. \\"I can't believe the amount of people there that were having problems breathing,\\" she told Channel 10. Charles Guest, chief health officer for the Department of Health and Human Services, would not comment on the number of fatalities, saying the department was aware of a \\"number of deaths\\" that may be associated with the event. He declined to comment further until a cause of death had been \\"attributed\\" for these cases. At least eight people were still in intensive care on Wednesday evening. It is understood one man is in a critical condition after suffering a cardiac arrest during the thunderstorm asthma. Hospitals were inundated with more than 1000 people seeking help on Monday night after the sudden change in weather triggered respiratory problems in people across the city. There were almost 2000 calls for ambulances in five hours and about 30 people were admitted into intensive care units. Sunshine Hospital was one of the worst hit, with 18 ambulances banked up in the early hours of Tuesday morning as crews frantically worked on patients. A Western Health spokeswoman said it was \\"unheard of\\" to have that many ambulances waiting outside the suburban emergency department at one time. After-hours clinics and pharmacies were also swamped with patients as they struggled to treat people with dwindling drug supplies. The Age spoke to 10 Melbourne late night pharmacies, six of them completely sold out of Ventolin on Monday night. Staff at 24-hour Mill Park Superclinic described the night thunderstorm asthma hit Melbourne as like \\"a bomb had gone off\\". Ambulance Employees Australia acting general secretary, Danny Hill, said ambulance crews were flat out during the emergency. \\"It's almost the equivalent of a major terrorist attack,\\" he said, adding that crews reported the system functioned well. \\"So while there would have been quite a lot of ramping across the city [paramedics] were pretty happy the crooker patients got dealt with quite quickly.\\" Asthma Foundation Victoria chief executive Robin Ould said he would write to Ms Hennessy calling for an action plan to deal with future asthma events. But asthma sufferers also needed ensure they were managing their condition, Mr Ould said. \\"We need to make people aware of what their own triggers are so they can manage their asthma.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Friends and family are mourning Hope Carnevali, a 20-year-old law student who died after an outbreak of thunderstorm asthma in Melbourne.

George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide.

It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method . The planet is at least 24 % more massive than Jupiter . The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth 's distance from the Sun. However , the orbit is very eccentric , so at periastron this distance is almost halved , and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000 , a group of scientists proposed , based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite , that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8 ° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination . If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk , which seems a plausible assumption , it would have an inclination of 40 ° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter , however later observations failed to confirm the disk 's existence . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. - HD 210277 is a 7th magnitude star in the constellation of Aquarius. It is a yellow dwarf star (spectral type G0V) with a mass around 0.92 times that of our Sun. Since its distance is about 70 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With binoculars it is easily visible. What object entity has the relation of 'constellation' with the subject 'hd 210277 b'?

Aquarius is a constellation in the celestial sphere, while crater refers to an impact crater, which is a depression in the surface of a solid celestial body caused by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body.

In his remarks to lawmakers, according to White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, Trump \\"endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb so-called \\"chain migration,\\" and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\\" Republican Rep.

The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist/bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Following the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, a largely hip hop-based label. The band accepted and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. Gone were the complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits, ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures. Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song \\"Angel of Death\\" which detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in the United States. In October 1986, Slayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US, and Malice in Europe. The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month in, drummer Lombardo left the band: \\"I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.\\" To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987. At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" for the film Less Than Zero.

Iraq Takes Aim at U.S.-Tied Sunni Groups’ Leaders But it is causing a rift with the American military, which contends that any significant diminution of the Awakening could result in renewed violence, jeopardizing the substantial security gains in the past year. United States commanders say that the practice, however unconventional, of paying the guerrillas has saved the lives of hundreds of American soldiers. “If it is not handled properly, we could have a security issue,” said Brig. Gen. David Perkins, the senior military spokesman in Iraq. “You don’t want to give anybody a reason to turn back to Al Qaeda.” Many Sunni insurgents had previously been allied with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and other extremist groups. Even before the new pressure from the government, many Awakening members were growing frustrated — and at an especially delicate time. United States and Iraqi negotiators have just completed a draft security agreement that next year, Iraqi officials say, would substantially pull American forces back from cities and towns to be replaced by Iraqi security forces. Awakening members complain, with rising bitterness, that the government has been slow to make good on its promises to recruit tens of thousands of its members into those security forces. General Perkins said only 5,200 members had been recruited in a force of about 100,000. “Some people from the government encouraged us to fight against Al Qaeda, but it seems that now that Al Qaeda is finished they don’t want us anymore,” said Abu Marouf, who, according to American officials, was a powerful guerrilla leader in the 1920s Revolutionary Brigade west of Baghdad. “So how can you say I am not betrayed?” After he said he discovered his name on lists of 650 names that an Iraqi Army brigade was using to arrest Awakening members west of Baghdad, Abu Marouf fled south of Falluja. His men, he said, “sacrificed and fought against Al Qaeda, and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them.” The Shiite-dominated government has never been pleased with the continuing American plan to finance and organize Sunni insurgents into militia guards, charging that they will stop fighting only as long as it serves their interests. “These people are like cancer, and we must remove them,” said Brig. Gen. Nassir al-Hiti, commander of the Iraqi Army’s 5,000-strong Muthanna Brigade, which patrols west of Baghdad, said of the Awakening leaders on his list for arrest. The Awakening began in western Anbar Province in 2006 as the violence in Iraq peaked and Sunni tribal leaders began feeling pressure from all sides, and then spread around the country as a means of Sunni self-preservation. The United States military focused its operations on Sunni insurgent groups, cooperating meantime with the Shiite-led government. The bodies of dozens of Sunnis surfaced on streets every morning, the victims of Shiite death squads. And many Sunnis themselves grew disgusted with the large number of civilian casualties in near-daily suicide bombings. The American military began paying many members of the Awakening movement as the program expanded, even including Shiite members who make up about one-fifth of the program. Now they are paid roughly 300 a month by the United States to guard checkpoints and buildings and — for those who used to be insurgents — to no longer blow up American convoys and shoot American troops. Although the “surge” is often described as the turning point that led to lower violence, a number of American officers contend the Awakening that began well before the surge in 2006 in Anbar Province and continued in Baghdad last year was the most significant reason for the decline. In some places, American casualties plunged within weeks of the Sunnis joining with American forces. Col. Kurt Pinkerton, the former American battalion commander who oversaw the Awakening program established west of Abu Ghraib last year, said it was critical to quelling violence. “I don’t think that area would have been calmed without those guys,” he said, giving credit to three of the most important members, including Abu Marouf, who are now being tracked down by General Nassir. General Nassir says he has orders to arrest Abu Marouf, whose older brother, Col. Faisal Ismail Hussein, was also a guerrilla leader before he became the Falluja police chief. General Nassir also says he has orders to arrest Abu Azzam and Abu Zachariyah, brothers who were leaders of the Islamic Army of Iraq but who were publicly hailed by Colonel Pinkerton and other American commanders last year for bringing relative peace to an insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. The general says his orders come from the military’s Baghdad Operations Center, which he said is taking orders from Iraqi judicial authorities. He acknowledged some disenchanted fighters may take up arms again “like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again.” But he says that reconciliation is impossible and that he would quit before he ever worked with former insurgents with blood on their hands. “They committed crimes and attacked the Iraqi Army and the American Army, and there is no way to rehabilitate them,” he said. Despite the government’s new aggressiveness against the Awakening, the program is far from finished. While going after hundreds of leaders and people the government considers dangerous, relations remain largely good with Sunni tribal sheiks in Anbar, where the Awakening was born. General Perkins also noted that American and Iraqi officials had tentatively agreed to a plan to hopefully transfer 58,000 American-paid militia guards this year onto Iraqi government payrolls under the command of the Baghdad Operation Center, which reports to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. But he said the transfer will not happen until crucial issues are resolved, such as how militiamen are vetted and what sort of jobs or training programs they will eventually go into. And while American officials are insistent that the program to pay militia guards continue to operate, General Perkins said it was not yet clear what recourse the military would have to prevent the Iraqi government from ending the program once it took control. “We don’t want this to be a dead-end, kick them to the curb kind of thing,” he said. Despite the threat of arrest by General Nassir’s troops if he returns to his home village west Baghdad, Abu Azzam, who had been an Awakening leader between Abu Ghraib and Falluja, said he has been able to travel to Baghdad to meet with aides to Mr. Maliki to discuss how the Shiite-dominated government and former Sunni guerrillas might be able to reconcile. “Our men worked hard and deserve appreciation and not punishment from the government,” he said. He described the discussions as “not going well,” though he said some Maliki aides preferred a more conciliatory tack. “For now, everything is stopped,” he said. He also said he feared the pullout of American troops, whom he saw as restraining the Shiite government from taken even harsher action against the Awakening. “America is the only one asking us not to fight the Maliki government.” As part of the Awakening’s efforts to transform itself into a political movement, Abu Azzam has organized a political slate for the coming provincial elections and says he has renounced violence for good. He is optimistic that some former fighters will not return to armed conflict if the government refuses them jobs, he said. But he acknowledged, “Part of them will fight the government if they are not recruited into the security forces.” An article on Aug. 22 about efforts by the Shiite-dominated government in Iraq to drive out many leaders of the Awakening movement, the organization of largely Sunni militias credited with helping reduce violence, referred incompletely to an assertion about militia disarmament by Sheik Jalaladeen al-Sagheer, a leading Shiite member of Parliament. While the sheik said in an interview that the government could not accept the existence of the Awakening and that its “days are numbered,” as the article reported, he was talking about all militias, including the Shiite-led Mahdi Army. His complete quotation was, “When the government attacked the Mahdi Army, it sent the message to all the militias including the Awakening that their days are numbered.” This correction was delayed because the sheik only recently contacted The Times about it, and his original quotation had to be rechecked with the Iraqi reporter who had interviewed him. Reporting was contributed by Mohammed Husain from Baghdad and Ibrahim Bin Ali, Iraq; Riyadh Mohammed from Baghdad; Campbell Robertson from Diyala Province; Ranya Kadri from Amman, Jordan; and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Falluja, Ramadi and Diyala.

The fighters in the Awakening are also unhappy because the government promised to give them jobs, but has been slow to do that.

Read this and answer the question Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \\"Illyric\\", \\"Slavic\\", \\"Slavonian\\", \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Dalmatian\\", \\"Serbian\\" or \\"Croatian\\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \\"Serbian\\" or \\"Croatian\\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \\"Bosnian\\", \\"Croatian\\", and \\"Serbian\\" were considered to be three names of a single official language. Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozović advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (‘Bosnian’ and ‘Montenegrin’). Today, use of the term \\"Serbo-Croatian\\" is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match. It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative, though alternative names have been used, such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS), which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal.

The Broncos were attempting to add to their lead on the Vikings' side of the field, however, quarterback Peyton Manning was intercepted by Vikings' linebacker Anthony Barr, who returned the football to the Broncos' 27-yard line. Two plays later, the Vikings narrowed the Broncos' lead, with quarterback Teddy Bridgewater finding wide receiver Mike Wallace alone in the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown just before halftime. The Broncos took the opening possession of the second half, and added to their lead, with a 1-yard touchdown pass from Manning to tight end Owen Daniels on a 4th-and-goal. Each team alternated punts on the next four possessions, until Vikings' running back Adrian Peterson went untouched for a 48-yard touchdown on a 4th-and-1, with 10:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Broncos' next possession, Manning was intercepted by safety Harrison Smith, and nine plays later, the Vikings pulled even at 20-20, with a 33-yard field goal by Walsh. The Broncos took a 23-20 lead two plays after the two-minute warning, with a 39-yard field goal by McManus. The Vikings had one last possession with 1:51 remaining in the game, however, on the sixth play of their final drive, Broncos' safety T. J.

First, I will focus on understanding the context provided in the review: The reviewer mentions that they initially did not enjoy the movie after watching it once in the theater. However, after purchasing the DVD and watching it two more times, they found the movie to be impressive and emotional. The reviewer recommends others to watch the movie at least twice to appreciate its greatness and experience the wonders of Japanese cinema. They also suggest watching with subtitles due to the low volume of the actors' voices. 2. Next, I will assess the overall tone and sentiment: Although the reviewer mentions initially not understanding the movie and not finding it enjoyable, their sentiment changes after watching the movie multiple times. They eventually describe it as powerful and moving, and encourage others to watch it. This change in opinion suggests a positive sentiment towards the movie. 3. Finally, I will consider the weight of both positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review: The negative aspect (not initially enjoying the movie) is outweighed by the positive recommendations and praise for the movie after multiple viewings. Based on this analysis, I can classify the review as \\"POS\\" since the overall sentiment of the review is positive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Don't worry; I'll explain everything! We have this equation: -30*c - 5005 + 4765 = 0 First, let's combine the numbers: -5005 + 4765, which is equal to -240. So now we have: -30*c - 240 = 0 Now, we need to get rid of that -240. We'll do this by adding 240 to both sides of the equation. This will give us: -30*c = 240 We're almost there! Now we need to solve for \\"c.\\" Since -30 is multiplied by \\"c,\\" we'll do the opposite and divide both sides by -30. This will look like: c = 240 / -30 Now, simply divide 240 by -30.

Perhaps you specialize in a specific chicken breed and feel you can market it to high end restaurants in your area. Or, you may be able to sell eggs at a lower price than your competitor. Do some research and visit your local farmer’s markets to see what types of eggs and meats are selling. You should also look at the menus of local restaurants and see if you can fill a gap in their supplies. You should also think about how you are going to get your products to your target audience. If your target audience seems to be more at local farmer’s markets, you should have all the supplies necessary to package and sell your products. If your target audience seems to be more in restaurants or the dining industry, you may need to consider using a nearby processing plant that is USDA-approved to ensure you can fulfill large orders for these clients. To turn a profit with your farm, you will need to focus on marketing your products to local food vendors and suppliers in your area. This will allow you to turn a bigger profit, selling larger units of your products, and to build working relationships with your buyers. Get the word out by advertising your products online and using local online databases that are setup to connect buyers with local farms. You can also create a Facebook page for your farm and update it regularly with announcements and photographs of the farm. This can act as free marketing for you and allow you to connect to buyers outside of your local area. You may want to consider creating business cards and a business website for your farm. This will allow you to advertise your farm and keep your customers informed on changes or updates in your products. Many chicken farmers will focus on local customers and sell their products at farmer’s markets in their area. This is a good option for beginning farms as it usually requires a very short travel time and you can build a customer base every week at the same markets. Your products should be properly labeled, with your farm logo or name, and notes on being locally farmed and preservative free. If you use organic feed for your chickens or if you pasture your chickens, you should also note this on the packaging. This will entice customers who are health conscious and environmentally conscious to buy your products. After several weeks to months of selling your products to your target audience, you should re evaluate your chickens. Note if one product from one chicken breed is selling more than the same product from a different chicken breed. Consider adjusting your chicken selection so you have more chickens who produce eggs and meat that sell well. This will ensure your farm is sustainable and responding to the needs of your customers.","completion":"This article talks about how to sell chicken and eggs from your farm.

He's no reality TV star. Isn't on anyone's list of 2016 presidential candidates. And the local press thinks he's so bland they call him the \\"Oatmeal Governor.\\" But Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell deserves national name-recognition for one reason: He's taking on one of the most important issues of our time. He's trying to get Alaska to talk about the \\"resident evil\\" of rape. \\"It's culturally permissible to be silent about it,\\" and that must change, Parnell told me in a recent interview at the governor's office in Juneau. (You commissioned that trip, by the way, as part of CNN's Change the List project. More on that here.) For years, this state -- which has the highest reported rate of rape in the country, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates -- denied it had a problem. Politicos and advocates said maybe Alaskans reported rape more often than people in other states -- but, gosh, it couldn't be a bigger problem here than elsewhere, could it? Related: The rapist next door. Parnell has helped end that era of senseless denial. In our interview, he called violence against women an \\"epidemic.\\" Like an alcoholic must admit he has a problem in order to face it, he told me, the governor of the state with the highest rape rate must, too, fess up to the problem in order to solve it. \\"I can't wave a wand and solve alcoholism, I can't wave a wand and solve domestic violence, but I can work to create a climate where it's culturally permissible to speak about these things with our family and friends, get people to help who cross our paths, to stand up for those who are being abused and hurt,\\" he said. \\"To me that's a win in the end.\\" True enough. The cornerstone of Parnell's campaign is his \\"Choose Respect\\" initiative, which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from Palin. Now nearing the end of his first full term and seeking re-election in 2014, Parnell, a Republican, oversees a state that has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention at a time when the overall state budget is shrinking. The \\"Choose Respect\\" program would receive 12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor's proposed budget were approved. That's only 0.1% of the total proposed budget, but it's still considerable. The laid-back 51-year-old governor, who looks like a kinder version of Sean Hannity plus Vladimir Putin, was born in California but moved to Anchorage at age 10, according to a biography on the Republican Governors Association website. His dad was in the Army and later served in the state legislature. Parnell, an attorney, once worked as a lobbyist for ConocoPhillips and other oil and gas interests. He served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to Palin. Even liberals in the state, like Caren Robinson, who started the first women's shelter in Juneau, praise the fact that he has supported addressing domestic violence and rape since the 1990s as a member of the legislature. Parnell was elected to the Alaska House at age 29. I disagree with some of Parnell's policies -- he's not giving enough autonomy to Native Alaskan communities and courts, for instance, which may be well poised in some cases to handle cases of sexual and gender-based violence; his decision to block part of Obamacare is unwise; and, despite substantial efforts to change things, parts of the state is so remote they're almost totally lawless, which leads people to rape and abuse with a sense of near-impunity. The lawless 'end of the land' But the governor's efforts to get Alaska to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves. No policy will be able to fix this problem as long as silence and shame surround rape and abuse. Someone's got to speak up. I saw some results of the \\"Choose Respect\\" program firsthand:. â€¢ In Juneau, I met members of the Thunder Mountain High School basketball team, which participates in a program called Coaching Boys into Men. The team's coach, John Blasco, talks with his players regularly about healthy dating relationships and respect for women. A star shooting guard, Matt Seymour, 18, told me there have been instances when he's told teammates not to use demeaning language about women because of what he learned as part of the program. â€¢ In one small town in southwest Alaska, I met young people who are learning about the Yupik Eskimo culture in after-school programs at the Tundra Women's Coalition, which receives funding from the state. The idea is that traditional culture can strengthen society and, ultimately, reduce rates of sexual assault. I also met women who were flown into a shelter run by the coalition from outlying villages that are not connected to road systems. â€¢ Across Alaska, I saw the power of a statewide survey analyzed by the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center, and funded by the state. The survey effectively ended debate about whether Alaska has a problem with domestic violence and sexual assault, said Andre Rosay, director of the center. The 2010 survey of 871 adult women found 37% had suffered sexual violence and 59% had been the victim of sexual violence and/or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes. \\"It was shocking and distressing for many people\\" to see how common violence against women really was in Alaska, said Lauree Morton, executive director of the Alaska Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, a state-funded agency. That survey also has spurred change. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska. Alaska shouldn't have needed those shocking numbers in order to act, but they do underscore the need for urgent action, and that information has won converts. Parnell told me he is convinced Alaska can change in part because his own grandfather was verbally and physically abusive to his family. But violence stopped with Parnell's father, who was never violent, he said. \\"That gives me hope for the future of our country, when I see people taking that responsibility to live larger than what they've been taught,\\" the governor said. Parnell is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts Alaska and should not be tolerated. The state promotes a series of \\"Choose Respect\\" marches, which were organized in more than 140 communities across the state last year and will be held again in the spring. Those rallies help create a climate where \\"more people come to safety and more people are willing to speak about the unspeakable,\\" Parnell said. \\"That's been the hardest part about the evil among us: We haven't been willing to talk about it,\\" the governor added. \\"The 'Choose Respect' initiative has given Alaskans permission to speak about these things.\\" Meet Alaska's pioneer woman. He added: \\"I'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame. They do not need to carry the guilt and shame -- and we are willing to embrace and love them unconditionally.\\" Parnell would like the \\"Choose Respect\\" campaign to spread across the country. He told me sports figures, in particular, have the power to raise awareness about ending sexual violence. \\"This is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people,\\" he said. \\"To have a nation where every person lives free of fear ... and every person has that hope and opportunity for the future, that's my dream. But it's going to take everybody -- it's going to take 'real-deal' heroes standing up and speaking out and giving people permission to speak about this.\\" Those \\"real-deal heroes\\" should include people like Sarah Palin, the woman still more associated with the governorship in the American public's mind than Parnell. And -- forget celebrity -- they should include you, too. Hold a \\"Choose Respect\\" march in your community and let me know about it by tagging your photos #chooserespect on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis? a). yes; b). it is not possible to tell; c). no;","completion":"b). it is not possible to tell; Before proceeding with an analysis on whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first break down the given statements: 1. Premise: Maybe a man. This statement is suggesting that there is a possibility that the subject in question is a man, but it neither confirms nor denies that the subject is indeed a man. The term \\"maybe\\" indicates uncertainty and suggests other potential outcomes (i.e., the subject could also not be a man). 2. Hypothesis: Perhaps many things, a man included. The hypothesis puts forth the idea that the subject could be any number of things, with a man being one of the possibilities. Similar to the premise, the hypothesis does not commit to a specific assertion, as it also introduces the term \\"perhaps\\" which indicates uncertainty. Now, let's consider the concept of entailment: Entailment in logic refers to the relationship between statements where if one statement (the premise) is true, then another statement (the hypothesis) must also be true as a result of the first statement's truth. If the truth of the hypothesis is entirely dependent upon the truth of the premise, then the premise is said to entail the hypothesis. Given the definitions of the statements and entailment, it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis in this case. The premise and hypothesis both express uncertainty, and neither statement claims the subject is definitively a man. In other words, there is no concrete information presented that would allow concluding that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis or vice versa. However, there is a possible intuitive connection between the premise and the hypothesis: both are uncertain statements that consider the subject could be a man among other possibilities.

Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: We learn that since the year 2006, fish farming has been _ . Options: A: earning more money than traditional fisheries B: developing rapidly around the world C: growing at a rate of 6.6 percent each day D: producing 46% of the world's supply of fish The answer is:","completion":"B: developing rapidly around the world Justification: The article states that fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year, and it now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish, which represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006.

Given that economists were expecting a mark closer to 200,000, the figure represents a \\"huge round of job creation\\" to end the year, reports CNBC. The department also raised the number of jobs added in October and November, bringing the average monthly jobs gain for the year to 221,000, reports the Wall Street Journal. \\"That’s below 2014’s monthly average of around 260,000,\\" writes Kristen Scholer. \\"But it’s still above what’s been the psychologically-important 200,000 level.\\" The take from AP writer Christopher Rugaber: \\"The strong figures underscore the resilience of the US economy at a time of global turmoil stemming from China's slowing economy and plummeting stock market.\\" China's markets were much calmer Friday morning, notes MarketWatch, boding well for US exchanges. Expand this summary.","completion":"The latest jobs report from the US Labor Department indicates that US employers added 292,000 jobs in December 2015, surpassing expectations and maintaining the unemployment rate at 5%. Economists had predicted an increase of around 200,000 jobs, so this report represents a significant boost in job creation at the end of the year. In addition to the December report, the Labor Department also revised its previous numbers for October and November upward, resulting in a 2015 average of 221,000 new jobs per month. While the 2015 average is below the previous year’s monthly average of approximately 260,000 jobs, it remains a crucial milestone, as it is above the psychologically significant 200,000 level, reflecting a consistent and sustained upward trend in the US job market. Several industries experienced notable job growth in December, with the construction industry adding 45,000 jobs, health care adding 39,000 jobs, and business services contributing 73,000 positions. The manufacturing and mining sectors, which struggled in 2015, showed modest growth in December. Average hourly earnings, however, remained unchanged, highlighting the continuing issue of wage stagnation in the United States. Despite the relatively positive outlook for the US labor market, global concerns, especially the economic slowdown in China, have raised concerns that the country’s troubles may eventually spill over to the US economy. The Federal Reserve will no doubt be keeping a close eye on these developments, as it may affect their plans for further interest rate hikes in 2016. This stronger-than-expected jobs report provides evidence that the US economy remains resilient amidst the turmoil and uncertainty in global financial markets and economies, particularly China’s slowing economy and fluctuating stock market. Although China's markets have started to stabilize, analysts are still cautious about the possibility of long-term effects on the global economy. In summary, the recent jobs report from the US Labor Department sets a positive tone for the US labor market, displaying continual growth in various sectors and signaling ongoing domestic economic recovery. The US economy has remained steady at a time when global challenges have the potential to impact other nations adversely. While the long-term effects of the global economic situation remain uncertain, this jobs report reflects a secure and strengthening US labor market for now."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reference to the collar suggests that the jacket is being worn correctly, with the collar exposed and accessible for the boutonniere placement. c) Orange rose as a boutonniere: This detail does not directly relate to the statement \\"A human in a jacket,\\" but it does provide additional context for the action taking place in the given sentence. Now, let's consider the resulting statement: 2. \\"A human in a jacket.\\" This statement focuses on the presence of a human being, wearing a jacket. Based on the information provided in the original sentence, we know that there is indeed a human present, as there are actually two humans mentioned: the woman and the man. Furthermore, the man is specifically described as wearing a suit jacket, confirming that there is a human wearing a jacket. It is important to note that the resulting statement simplifies the action. The original sentence provides detailed context for an event wherein a woman places a boutonniere on a man's jacket, but the resulting statement does not convey this specific action. Instead, the statement \\"A human in a jacket\\" provides a simplified, overarching description of the situation. In conclusion, based on the presence of both a woman and a man in the original sentence, and the specific mention of the man's suit jacket collar, the statement \\"A human in a jacket\\" logically follows. The statement may not capture all the details and context of the given sentence, it does correctly identify the presence of a human being wearing a jacket."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Question What may happen before morning comes ? Answer:","completion":"Before morning comes, several events and activities may take place, both in the individual's life and the world around them. Here are some possibilities: 1. Dreaming: As the individual goes to sleep, they may experience vivid dreams that are influenced by their thoughts and emotions from the day. Dreaming is a natural part of the sleep cycle, and it's believed to help with processing memories and emotions. 2. Tossing and turning: The individual may experience some degree of restlessness during their sleep, adjusting their position several times throughout the night. This can happen due to various factors, such as stress or an uncomfortable sleeping environment. 3. Late-night thoughts: Sometimes, even when we try to sleep, our mind continues to churn with thoughts and ideas. The person might spend some time reflecting on their day and planning for tomorrow, further processing their feelings of guilt, their hair color change, and their search for the perfect strappy shoes. 4. Nighttime routines: Others in the household might be completing their bedtime routines, such as brushing their teeth, reading, or watching a movie before finally drifting off to sleep. These activities can contribute to the background noise and ambiance of the night. 5. Natural occurrences: Outside, various natural occurrences can take place, such as changes in weather, the movement of nocturnal animals, or the lunar cycle impacting the visibility of the night sky. These events may go unnoticed as the person sleeps but are essential aspects of the world transitioning from night to day. 6. Early morning activities: Some people might start their day before the sun rises, engaging in activities such as exercise, meditation, or preparing for work. The individual in question might hear some of these early risers as they go about their morning, which could affect the quality of their sleep. 7. Unexpected events: There's always the possibility of unexpected events happening during the night, such as a power outage, a loud noise, or a sudden rainstorm. These unpredictable occurrences could potentially interrupt the individual's sleep and create a sense of anticipation or anxiety about what the morning might bring. In summary, as the night progresses, many events and activities can take place both within the individual's personal life and the world around them. From natural occurrences to mental processes and household routines, the transition from night to day is filled with countless experiences that shape the person's morning and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"Q:Information: - Malaysia is a federal constitutional monarchy located in Southeast Asia.

This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares, Lynch provides a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both. The simple true story of an Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) who rides a lawn mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, stricken brother, there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes (some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland, filmed by veteran cinematographer Freddy Francis) to make it an undeniable Lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way, allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life, and Sissy Spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter (whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time. But that's vintage Lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best.

With its national treasure once again missing, the Shah of Lugash requests the assistance of Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) of the SÃ»retÃ©, as Clouseau had recovered the diamond the last time it was stolen.

Researchers at the University of Chicago who studied mother-child interactions found that the type of praise children receive affects their attitudes towards challenges later in life. Specifically, praise that focused on their behavior and the choices that kids made helped them deal with difficult experiences better five years later, compared with praise that focused more on the child himself, like \\"You're a good boy.\\" The study, which appears in the journal Child Development, is the first major study of praise and child development done outside of a lab setting. \\"It's exciting to see _ play out in the real world,\\" said Elizabeth Gunderson who led the study. \\"Praising the efforts, actions and work of kids is going to be more beneficial in their long-term persistence and desire to be challenged and work hard in the future.\\" Such \\"process praise\\" includes comments such as \\"You worked really hard\\", which emphasize a child's actions. \\"Person praise\\" includes comments like \\"You're so smart\\", which focus on a child's personal qualities. These distinctions aren't new in the field of psychology, but exactly how they affect children's development over the years hasn't always been clear. As part of the study, the researchers visited the homes of more than 50 kids between the ages of 1 and 3, and filmed their daily interactions with their parents during 90-minute sessions. Five years later, the researchers followed up with the families, measuring the children's attitudes towards challenges and problem solving. The children who grew up with more process praise were more open to challenges. Though person praise didn't seem to have any negative effect on the children, the study suggests that process praise teaches children that their talents and abilities can be developed and improved, while person praise sends the message that their abilities are fixed and therefore not easily changed.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. New York police detective Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals, leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law. He has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used. Dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals. He is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence. When a rich Texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill), Dixon is assigned to the case. Scalise tells Dixon's superior officer Detective Lieutenant Thomas (Karl Malden) that the victim had been accompanied by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his wife Morgan (Gene Tierney) and that Paine had committed the murder. Dixon goes to Paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when Paine punches him, Dixon retaliates and Paine collapses and dies. Dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river. Paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at Scalise's place, adds that her father had gone to Paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she'd returned home with facial bruising. Paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), had threatened that if it happened again he would beat Paine up. This information leads to Taylor being arrested and charged with murder. Nobody accepts Dixon's explanation that Scalise had killed the Texan and then had Paine killed to eliminate him as a witness. Dixon continues to make various attempts to get Scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in Paine's death and the cover up. He does this and also records that he is going alone to confront Scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for Dixon's murder. The confrontation with Scalise and the eventual means by which Dixon achieves his own redemption, provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller. Dana Andrews' strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow Paine's accidental death. Dixon, however, isn't the only one to experience misfortune as Morgan, a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her. Her father, who'd some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police, unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit.

Article: There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. Information in long-term memory can be remembered at a later time when it is needed. The information may be kept for days or weeks. However, information in short-term memory is kept for only a few seconds, usually by repeating the information over and over. The following experiment shows how short-term memory has been studied. Henning studied how students who are learning English as a second language remember vocabulary. The subjects in his experiment were 75 college students. They represented all levels of ability in English: beginning, intermediate , and native speaking students. To begin, the subjects listened to a recording of a native speaker reading a paragraph in English. Following the recording, the subjects took a 15-question test to see which words they remembered. Each question had four choices. The subjects had to circle the word they had heard in the recording, Some of the questions had four choices that sound alike. For example, weather, whether, wither, and wetter are four words that sound alike. Some of the questions had four choices that have the same meaning. Method, way, manner, and system would be four words with the same meaning. Finally the subjects took a language proficiency test. Henning found that students with a lower proficiency in English made more of their mistakes on words that sound alike; students with a higher proficiency made more of their mistakes on words that have the same meaning. Henning's results suggest that beginning students hold the sound of words in their short-term memory, and advanced students hold the meaning of words in their short-term memory.

Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up has the potential to fall. It has potential energy. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in 1.5 Figure below. Gravitational potential energy depends on two things. It depends on its weight, because a large falling rock can do more damage than a leaf falling from a tree. It also depends on its height above the ground. Like the skateboarder, the higher the ramp, the faster he will be going when he reaches the bottom. Like all energy, gravitational potential energy has the ability to do work. In this case, weight has the potential to deliver a force. More important for us is that it has the ability to cause change. What kind of change you may ask? Gravitational potential energy has the ability to cause motion.

(May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has a distinguished World War II record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling Â£125 from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson). Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries. Carrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred Â£100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe. As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement.

A:","completion":"A: No, a Vodka Martini and Flirtini do not contain the same ingredients. Although both cocktails feature vodka as a primary component, their other ingredients and preparation methods lead to quite distinct tastes and presentations. Below is a comparison of the two cocktails, highlighting their ingredients and preparation methods. Vodka Martini: - Ingredients: 1. Vodka (typically 2 ounces, or 60 milliliters) 2. Dry vermouth (typically 0.5 ounce, or 15 milliliters) 3. Olives or a lemon twist for garnish - Preparation: 1. In a mixing glass filled with ice, combine the vodka and dry vermouth. 2. Stir the mixture well to chill and dilute the ingredients. 3. Strain the mixture into a chilled Martini glass. 4. Garnish with olives or a lemon twist, as desired. Flirtini: - Ingredients: 1. Vodka (typically 1.5 ounces, or 45 milliliters) 2. Pineapple juice (typically 2 ounces, or 60 milliliters) 3. Cointreau or Triple Sec (typically 0.5 ounce, or 15 milliliters) 4. Lime juice (typically 0.25 ounce, or 7.5 milliliters) 5. Champagne or sparkling wine (1-2 ounces, or 30-60 milliliters) 6. Fresh raspberries or pineapple chunks for garnish - Preparation: 1. In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, combine the vodka, pineapple juice, Cointreau or Triple Sec, and lime juice. 2. Shake the mixture vigorously to thoroughly mix and chill the ingredients. 3. Strain the mixture into a chilled Martini or cocktail glass. 4. Top the drink with Champagne or sparkling wine. 5. Garnish with fresh raspberries or pineapple chunks, as desired. In summary, while both the Vodka Martini and Flirtini feature vodka as a primary ingredient, the other components and preparation methods differ considerably. The Vodka Martini is a classic cocktail with a dry, crisp taste resulting from the blend of vodka and dry vermouth. On the other hand, the Flirtini is a fruitier, modern cocktail made from a combination of vodka, pineapple juice, an orange liqueur, lime juice, and sparkling wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - The , literally \\"Army of the Greater Japanese Empire\\", was the official ground-based armed force of the Empire of Japan, from 1871 to 1945. It was controlled by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of War, both of which were nominally subordinate to the Emperor of Japan as supreme commander of the army and the navy. Later an Inspectorate General of Military (Army) Aviation became the third agency with oversight of the army. During wartime or national emergencies, the nominal command functions of the emperor would be centralized in an Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ), an ad-hoc body consisting of the chief and vice chief of the Army General Staff, the minister of war, the chief and vice chief of the Naval General Staff, the inspector general of military aviation, and the inspector general of military training. - The as part of the Supreme War Council was established in 1893 to coordinate efforts between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy during wartime. In terms of function, it was approximately equivalent to the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff Committee. - The Southern Expeditionary Army ( Nanp gun ) was an army group of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. It was responsible for all military operations in South East Asian and South West Pacific campaigns of World War II. Its military symbol was NA . The Southern Expeditionary Army Group was formed on November 6 , 1941 , under the command of Gensui Count Terauchi Hisaichi , with orders to attack and occupy Allied territories and colonies in South East Asia and the South Pacific . - The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and is the ceremonial head of state of Japan's system of constitutional monarchy. According to the 1947 constitution, he is \\"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\\" Historically, he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu, and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs, including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation. - The was the historical Japanese nation-state and great power that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 to the enactment of the 1947 constitution of modern Japan. What is the relationship between 'southern expeditionary army group' and 'empire of japan'? Answer:","completion":"The Southern Expeditionary Army Group was an integral part of the Empire of Japan's military forces during World War II. The relationship between the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and the Empire of Japan can be understood in terms of their common goal, organizational structure, and the role of the Emperor in their operations. 1. Common goal: The primary objective of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group was to advance and secure the interests of the Empire of Japan in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. They were tasked with attacking and occupying Allied territories and colonies to expand Japan's influence and control in the region. This goal was aligned with the broader strategic aims of the Empire of Japan, which sought to establish itself as a dominant power in Asia. 2. Organizational structure: The Southern Expeditionary Army Group fell under the command and control of the Imperial Japanese Army, which was one of the two principal components of the Empire of Japan's military forces, the other being the Imperial Japanese Navy. The army's structure and hierarchy were determined by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and the Ministry of War, and during wartime, the Imperial General Headquarters (IGHQ) would oversee and coordinate efforts between the army and the navy. 3. Role of the Emperor: As the supreme commander of the Empire of Japan's military forces, the Emperor of Japan was the ultimate authority over the actions and decisions of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group. While the emperor's role was largely ceremonial, his figure represented the unity and the will of the nation. The commanders and soldiers of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group were duty-bound to serve and fulfill the Emperor's directives, and their loyalty to him played a crucial role in motivating and justifying their actions in the field. In summary, the Southern Expeditionary Army Group was a vital component of the Empire of Japan's military strategy during World War II and served as an instrument to advance the empire's interests in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. The group was organizationally subordinate to the Imperial Japanese Army and, ultimately, to the Emperor of Japan, who symbolized the unity and purpose of the nation. The relationship between the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and the Empire of Japan was one of interdependence, with the army group working to advance the goals of the empire and the empire providing the organizational structure, leadership, and ideological foundation for the army group's actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

Plot title: Counter-Attack Movie plot: In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process of a bird building its nest is as follows: 1. Selecting a suitable location: Before the bird begins collecting materials for the nest, it first selects a suitable location that meets specific criteria. These criteria include factors such as safety from predators, protection from the elements, proximity to resources such as food and water, and the bird's species-specific nesting preferences. After this crucial first step, the process proceeds as the original description outlines: 2. The bird collects twigs and other refuse: Once the bird has chosen an ideal location for its nest, it starts gathering materials. These materials can include twigs, leaves, grass, moss, and even human-made items like string or paper. The bird collects these materials over time and brings them back to the nest site. 3. The bird makes a flat base with twigs: With a stash of materials at its disposal, the bird then starts constructing the nest by forming a strong and flat base. This base may consist mostly of twigs, arranged and interwoven to create a stable foundation. 4. The bird makes sides with twigs and other things: Once the base is established, the bird begins adding layers to create the sides of the nest. This involves weaving more twigs, grass, and other materials together to form a sturdy cup or bowl-like structure. 5. The bird adds softer material to the inside: After the main structure of the nest has been completed, the bird adds softer materials to the interior. This can include feathers, moss, or other soft materials, providing a comfortable and warm place for eggs or hatchlings. 6. The nest is done: With the previous steps completed, the bird's nest is now finished. The bird can then lay its eggs and raise its young in this carefully constructed home. In conclusion, the missing first step in this process is the selection of a suitable location for the nest. This is essential for the bird as it ensures that the nest provides a safe, secure, and suitable environment for raising its offspring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing.

We have this equation: -55 * g + 2197 = -2185 + 4052 First, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation: -2185 + 4052 = 1867 Now, our equation looks like this: -55 * g + 2197 = 1867 Next, we need to move the 2197 from the left side to the right side. We do this by subtracting 2197 from both sides of the equation: -55 * g = 1867 - 2197 Now, let's subtract the numbers on the right side: 1867 - 2197 = -330 Our equation now looks like this: -55 * g = -330 To finish solving for 'g', we need to divide both sides by -55: g = -330 / -55 Finally, let's divide the numbers: -330 / -55 = 6 So, the answer is: g = 6"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The hellish exoplanet that you will never want to visit, even if you could An international team of scientists has used a ground-breaking technique to study the atmosphere of an Earth-sized exoplanet for the first time, revealing an utterly inhospitable but equally fascinating world. Lead by scientists from University College London in the UK, the group were able to observe the surprisingly dense atmosphere of exoplanet 55 Cancri e using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and a swathe of new analysis techniques. The team’s research, soon to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, indicated that the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e comprised largely of hydrogen and helium, but the absence of water vapour suggested that finding life on this far-flung world was highly unlikely. “This is a very exciting result because it’s the first time that we have been able to find the spectral fingerprints that show the gases present in the atmosphere of a super-Earth” said Angelos Tsiaras, a PhD student who helped develop the techniques used to analyse the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e. “The observations of 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere suggest that the planet has managed to cling on to a significant amount of hydrogen and helium from the nebula from which it originally formed.” While 55 Cancri e is described as a ‘super-Earth’ due to its close approximation in size, that is where the comparisons end. A year on 55 Cancri e is just 18 hours long. (ESA/Hubble, M. Kommesser) Artists impressions of the distant planet, which orbits a different sun-like star to Earth, reveal an incredibly dangerous and hellish landscape, where a year is just eighteen hours long and where temperatures soar to over 2000 degress celcius – hot enough to melt titanium. Apart from hydrogen and helium, the data also revealed hints of hydrogen cyanide in the atmosphere, an extremely toxic and explosive compound that can kill humans within minutes. The scientists were able to make the observations by sweeping the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) quickly across the parent star to reveal the spectrum of its starlight. The data was then analysed by software to reveal the spectrum of 55 Cancri e, illuminated by the light of the star it orbits. Little was previously known about 55 Cancri e before these close observations, only that it had a mass approximately eight times that of Earth, and that it was roughly 40 light years from Earth. The planet has made headlines in previous years after research determined that its interior is carbon-rich, leading to the nickname “the diamond planet”.

Andy Ticer and Michael Hudman have been friends since childhood - that is after the two of them got past the habit of badmouthing each other every time their rival Catholic schools met on the playing field. Though the duo were born and raised in Memphis, both come from large, Italian-American families that ritualize meals and celebrate their culinary heritage. The two 2013 Food & Wine Best New Chefs preserve and progress their dual Southern/Italian culture at their restaurants Andrew Michael Italian Kitchen and Hog & Hominy. Their recently-published cookbook, \\"Collards and Carbonara\\" shares many of the techniques and recipes, so their ever-growing fan base can explore this soulful, seasonal meld at home. And you can't nail the Italian half of the equation without mastering fresh pasta. Here are five shapes that - with a little practice - may make you say \\"Ciao!\\" to the boxed stuff for good. Five classic pasta shapes to make at home: Andy Ticer and Michael Hudman 1. Sciatelli \\"When we were studying in Calabria, this was the pasta that we had the privilege to eat every Sunday. It is labor-intensive, so you rarely see it anymore, but we want to keep it alive. Supposedly, it was originally shaped with broom bristles, which eventually were replaced by metal rods similar to the wire used to make coat hangers. We watched our instructor make this dish one day, took notes like crazy, and all I could think about was what would happen if we couldn't re-create it back home. Michael mastered it on the first try. I made him write down everything he did, step-by-step.\\" – Andy To make sciatelli: Make basic pasta dough as directed. Roll the pasta dough twice through a standard pasta machine on the number 1 setting. Lay 1 pasta sheet on a work surface and, using a sharp knife, cut the sheet lengthwise into strips 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Roll up the strips into rods. Cut the rods into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Using a wooden skewer or a thin metal rod (about the diameter of a coat hanger), place the cut pasta onto the skewer and roll it around the skewer into a noodle. Give a gentle twist and pull to remove the skewer and leave a small hole through the pasta. Place the noodles, not touching, on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. – Basic Pasta Dough Makes about 2 lb (1 kg) 4 large eggs 1 tablespoon olive oil 8 cups (21⁄2 lb/1.25 kg) 00 flour In a large liquid measuring pitcher, combine the eggs, oil, and enough lukewarm water to measure 21∕2 cups (20 fl oz/625 ml). Whisk until well blended. Put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml) of the egg-oil mixture into the well. Then, using a fork, slowly draw the flour into the egg-oil mixture. Continue to incorporate the flour until all of it is combined with the liquid and a shaggy dough has formed. Add more egg-oil mixture if needed to help the dough come together. Once the dough comes together, turn it out of the bowl onto a clean work surface and knead until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 45 minutes before using. 2. Gnocchi \\"Gnocchi will always be on our menu in some fashion. We have a special board on which we roll the finished dumplings to create grooves in which the sauce can catch. For me, making the little potato dumplings is a form of meditation. Everything else falls away.\\" – Michael To make gnocchi: 4 russet potatoes 2 large egg yolks 15 grates fresh nutmeg Kosher salt and freshly cracked pepper 2 cups (10 oz/315 g) 00 flour To make the gnocchi, preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Using a fork, poke holes all over the potatoes. Put them on the oven rack and bake until very tender when pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Cut the potatoes open lengthwise across the top and let the steam escape. As soon as they are cool enough to handle, use a large spoon to scoop all of the potato flesh from the skins. Put the still-warm potato flesh in a food mill set over a bowl and turn the crank until all the potato flesh is in the bowl; do this quickly as you don’t want the flesh to cool completely before you make the dough. Using a kitchen scale, weigh out 2 lb (1 kg) of the potato flesh and place in a bowl. Add the egg yolks, nutmeg, a large pinch of salt, and 4 turns pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon or your hands. Add 11⁄2 cups (71⁄2 oz/235 g) of the flour and use your hands to incorporate it gently into the dough. Take care not to over-mix or the gnocchi will be heavy. Add additional flour a tablespoon at a time if the dough seems too wet. On a clean work surface, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, shape it into a short cylinder. Place the fingers of both hands on the cylinder and roll it back and forth on the clean surface (flour on the surface will make it difficult to roll the cylinders), gradually shifting your hands to the ends, to form a log about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Make logs out of the remaining 3 dough pieces. Next, using a knife, cut each log into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Roll each piece across a gnocchi board to create grooves in which the sauce can collect. If you don’t have a gnocchi board, gently press the tines of a fork into the top surface of each piece of gnocchi. 3. Pappardelle On this wide noodle that stands up to heavier ingredients, Andy says, \\"When I was growing up, my mom made the best pot roast with potatoes and carrots, and this recipe is an homage to that memorable dish. It was a perfect meal during cold-weather months, and I can remember coming indoors from playing football in the front yard and the house would smell like beef stew. Michael wanted to bring out the red wine in the dish, so we decided to start the pasta with wine rather than water.\\" To make red wine pappardelle 4 large eggs Extra-virgin olive oil About 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml) dry red wine 8 cups (21⁄2 lb/1.25 kg) 00 flour Semolina flour for dusting Crack the eggs into a large liquid measuring pitcher and add 2 glugs (about 2 tablespoons) of olive oil. Pour the wine into the pitcher until it measures 21∕2 cups (20 fl oz/625 ml) total liquid. Whisk the ingredients together. Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the center. Pour the wine mixture into the well. Using your hands, work the liquid into the flour until the mixture starts to come together in a ball. Turn the dough ball out onto a clean work surface and knead the dough until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. To form the pasta sheets, roll the pasta dough through a standard pasta machine to the number 4 setting. Working with 1 sheet at a time, dust it on both sides with flour and lay it on a work surface. Cut the sheet lengthwise into sections 8 inches (20 cm) long. Using a fluted or straight pasta cutter, cut down the length of the pasta sheet to make noodles about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Place the noodles, not touching, on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. 4. Malfatti \\"Malfatti means 'poorly made' or 'misshapen.' We like the notion that not all food needs to be perfect to be delicious, so we purposely make our malfatti into slightly different sizes. Our favorite dough for malfatti is made from pumpkin puree, which we make in the fall and winter when we get fresh pumpkins from our local farm.\\" – Michael To make pumpkin malfatti Make the pumpkin malfatti dough as directed. On a clean work surface, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Working with 1 dough piece at a time, and covering the unused portions of the dough with a damp kitchen towel as you work, shape it into a short cylinder. Place the fingers of both hands on the cylinder and roll it back and forth on the work surface, gradually shifting your hands to the ends, to form a log about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Next, using a knife, cut each log into about 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Roll each piece across a gnocchi board to create grooves in which the sauce can collect. If you don’t have a gnocchi board, gently press the tines of a fork into the top surface of each piece of malfatti. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When the water is boiling, drop in the malfatti and cook until they float to the top, then set a kitchen timer and cook for 5 more minutes. – Pumpkin Malfatti Dough Makes about 2 lb (1 kg) 1 cup (8 oz/250 g) pumpkin purée, homemade (page 235) or canned 1 cup (8 oz/250 g) good-quality fresh ricotta cheese 2 large eggs 1⁄4 cup (1 oz/30 g) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Finely grated zest of 1 orange 12 grates fresh nutmeg Pinch of kosher salt 4 cups (11⁄4 lb/625 g) 00 flour Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin purée, ricotta, eggs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, orange zest, nutmeg, and salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the flour, 1 cup (5 oz/155 g) at a time, and use your hands to incorporate the ingredients until they come together in a ball. The less flour you add, the less dense the dough will be. You’re aiming for a texture that is slightly heavier than potato gnocchi but with a strong pumpkin flavor. 5. Strozzapreti \\"This little pasta has some interesting stories behind it's name, which translates literally to 'priest' stranglers.' Our favorite story is the one about a rotund priest in a small town in Emilia-Romagna who ate the pasta only once a year. Avoiding gluttony was not his strong suit, however, so on that day he would cram as much of the pasta as fast as he could down his gullet until he nearly choked to death. Our version of the dish (with rabbit ragu, pictured above) came from a play on rabbits eating carrots.\\" – Michael To make Strozzapreti Make the carrot-top pasta dough as directed. To form the pasta sheets, roll the pasta dough through a standard pasta machine to the number 4 setting. Working with 1 sheet of pasta at a time, and covering the unused portions of the dough with a damp kitchen towel as you work, cut the sheet lengthwise down the center. Using a sharp knife, cut the sheet crosswise into 1∕2-inch (12-mm) strips. To form the shapes, take 2 of the strips and, using your fingers, pinch them together in the center. Roll them back and forth in the palm of your hand, so that the pieces adhere in the center but the ends are still separate. The finished shapes will resemble a cross between cavatelli (oblong pasta shells) and bow ties. As the strozzapreti are formed, place them, not touching, on a semolina-dusted baking sheet. – Carrot-top pasta dough Makes about 2 lb (1 kg) 12 oz (375 g) carrot tops 8 cups (21⁄2 lb/1.25 kg) 00 flour 4 large egg yolks Extra-virgin olive oil Semolina flour for dusting Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil, add the carrot tops, and blanch just to set the color, about 30 seconds. Plunge the carrot tops into ice water to lock in the color, then drain and transfer to a blender. Add 2 cups (16 fl oz/500 ml) water and purée until smooth. Pour the purée through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring pitcher, add the egg yolks and 3 glugs (about 3 tablespoons) of olive oil, and whisk until blended. Put the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the center. Pour 2 cups of the carrot top–egg mixture into the well. Then, using a fork, slowly draw the flour into the egg mixture. Continue to incorporate the flour until all of it is combined with the liquid and a shaggy dough has formed. Add more carrot top-egg mixture if needed to help the dough come together. Once the dough comes together, turn it out of the bowl onto a clean work surface and knead until it is smooth and has nice elasticity (it should spring back immediately when you press it with a fingertip), about 10 minutes. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes before using. Is there someone you'd like to see in the hot seat?

He drew on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent. Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both groups to expand his wealth and power in the country. During Richard's rule, John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland, and he continued this policy as king. In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country and used a new charter to order compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland. John stopped short of trying to actively enforce this charter on the native Irish kingdoms, but historian David Carpenter suspects that he might have done so, had the baronial conflict in England not intervened. Simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for England.

Here are possible answers to this question: - to be alone - believe in god - enjoy themselves - face each other - group together I believe the correct choice is \\"enjoy themselves\\", here's why: A:","completion":"Attending a party is typically associated with having a good time, socializing, and enjoying various activities, thus the answer 'enjoy themselves' is the most suitable choice out of the presented answers. To begin with, consider the nature of a party: it's a social gathering usually organized for entertainment or celebration. Commonly, parties feature music, dancing, food, beverages, and other forms of entertainment that foster a relaxing and enjoyable environment. Parties can recognize special occasions like birthdays, weddings, graduations, or holidays, or they might simply serve as an opportunity for people to gather and refresh their minds. The option 'to be alone' does not align with the social aspect of a party. Parties are fundamentally about bringing people together to share a unified experience. While one might find moments of solitude at a party, the main focus is on communal interaction and not isolation. 'Believe in god', as an answer, is not typically relevant in the context of attending a party. While certain ceremonies or religious celebrations can incorporate aspects of a party, faith or religious belief is not a general reason why someone might attend a party. The option 'face each other' could be considered relevant in a metaphorical sense as people attend parties to interact and engage with each other. However, this answer does not capture the broader aspects of attending a party. It restricts the motive to a confrontation or meeting, while parties often involve more casual and enjoyable interactions instead. The choice 'group together' is partially accurate, as parties indeed involve grouping together. Nevertheless, this lacks the underlying motivation of attending a party; it doesn't account for the enjoyment and celebration that are central to the party experience. Grouping together could occur in any number of scenarios, many of which wouldn't be defined as 'parties.' Therefore, given the options, 'enjoy themselves' is the most fitting answer. It captures the primary reason why people attend parties—for entertainment, celebration, and pleasure. This option speaks to the fun, enjoyment, and relaxation inherent in party environments, covering a wide range of party types, from casual get-togethers to formal galas. It is the pleasure of socialization, laughter, dance, music, and generally having a good time that attracts people to parties and keeps them coming back for more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

Drugstore Cowboy's exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its Portland setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed My Own Private Idaho (1991). Only with the success of Cowboy was Van Sant now given license to make Idaho (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now New Line Cinema had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the Idaho script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an Independent Spirit Award for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his Drugstore Cowboy screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the Venice Film Festival among others. In addition, it helped Reeves--previously best known for his work in the Bill and Ted movies--to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him. Van Sant's next film, a 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins' Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of 8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including Uma Thurman, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister Rain (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster. Van Sant's 1995 film To Die For helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of Joyce Maynard's novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clark's Kids; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy.

He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother.

The medium can store any kind of digital data and is widely used for software and other computer files as well as video programs watched using DVD players. DVDs offer higher storage capacity than compact discs while having the same dimensions. - In computing and optical disc recording technologies, an optical disc (OD) is a flat, usually circular disc which encodes binary data (bits) in the form of pits (binary value of 0 or off, due to lack of reflection when read) and lands (binary value of 1 or on, due to a reflection when read) on a special material (often aluminium ) on one of its flat surfaces. The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor.

Here is a news article: Propaganda video circulated Tuesday claims to show beheading of photojournalist, who went missing in Syria in 2012 Militants from Islamic State (Isis) claimed to have killed an American journalist long held captive in Syria in retaliation for ongoing US air strikes against its forces in Iraq. A propaganda video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man dressed in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Wright Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The masked executioner spoke in English, with what sounded like a British accent, and said the slaying came in response to the air strikes ordered by President Barack Obama against Isis 12 days ago. Isis, whose chief spokesman came under US state department sanctions on Monday, warned of further revenge – including on another man purported to be a captured US journalist, Steven Sotloff – and in the video the victim was made to read a statement blaming the US for his own murder. Foley has been missing in Syria since November 2012, where he went to report on the bloody struggle to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. He was initially thought to have been captured by forces loyal to the Assad regime. Foley’s mother later released a statement saying her son gave his life to expose the suffering of the Syrian people. Diane Foley asked his kidnappers to release their other captives. “He was an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,” she said. “We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world. “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” YouTube took down the gruesome video, but not before it sparked a debate on social media about the ethics of sharing it. Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the video appeared to be genuine, and that the killer could well be a Briton. He said that although further analysis would need to be carried out, the man “on the face of it appears to have been a British person” and that this would not be surprising given the “significant number” of Britons fighting with Isis in Syria and Iraq. Screengrab from the ISIS video showing the execution of James Foley Photograph: Youtube Foley, 40, a former Stars and Stripes reporter, was captured in November 2012 near the Syrian town of Taftanaz. It was not his first detention while reporting: in 2011, he was taken while reporting on the uprising against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi’s forces ultimately released him after six weeks in captivity. A friend of Foley’s and his fellow captive in Libya, journalist Clare Morgana Gillis, wrote in a 2013 essay that captivity was “the state most violently opposite his nature.” Gillis described Foley as gentle, friendly, courageous and impatient with “anything that slows his forward momentum.” In a January 2013 interview with local television news near her Rochester, New Hampshire home, Foley’s mother Diane said her son was “passionate about covering the story in Syria, passionate about the people there.” Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said US intelligence was working to determine the authenticity of the video. “If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,” Hayden said in a statement. A day after Obama declared that Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US warplanes had broken Isis’ hold on the critical Mosul Dam, US Central Command announced two strikes near it on Monday, to “further expand control of the area.” One strike was said to have destroyed an Isis checkpoint while the other was “not successful.” Obama has offered no timeframe for the length of his campaign against Isis. The US military has bombed over 90 targets attributed to Isis, including vehicle convoys, mobile artillery and fixed positions, since 8 August. Most of the strikes have come in the past few days, near the dam. The other strikes have occurred either to blunt an Isis advance on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil or to lift an Isis siege on Mount Sinjar, where it chased thousands of Iraqi Yazidis whom it threatened to kill unless they converted to Islam. The US considers the siege broken. ||||| After Hurricane Maria, one family in Boston has been unable to speak to relatives in Puerto Rico.

Furthermore, the job involved lots of outdoor playtime. This suggests that the person or persons being cared for were active and required physical activities to keep them engaged. Now, let's consider the possible choices: i. Wife: It is unlikely that a wife would require all of these services, especially baths, stories, and supervised outdoor playtime. ii. Dogs: While dogs might need some of these care services, such as outdoor playtime, they would not typically need assistance with baths and stories, nor would one typically cook breakfast, lunch, and snacks for them. iii. Kids: The tasks mentioned in the context, such as cooking meals, baths, stories, and outdoor playtime, are all activities commonly associated with children. This makes it highly probable that children were the ones being cared for in this scenario. iv. Cats: Cats, like dogs, would not typically require baths, stories, or cooked meals. Outdoor playtime might be more applicable to cats, but not to the extent mentioned in the context. Based on the analysis of the context and the possible choices, the answer is: iii. Kids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: This article: Since the recording of \\"Good Vibrations\\" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \\"modules\\"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of \\"party tracks\\"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with Beach Boys' Party! in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for \\"Good Vibrations\\". Most of Smiley Smile was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of organ, honky-tonk piano, and electronic bass played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered Baldwin organ during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre. Most of the piano was played by Brian, and most of the bass was played by Carl. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with varispeed being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On \\"She's Goin' Bald\\", a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: \\"He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'\\" When asked if Brian was \\"still the producer of Smiley Smile\\", Carl answered, \\"Most definitely.\\" Brian acknowledged: \\"We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the group whose vocal pitch was raised by a new device called the Eltro Information Rate Changer?, what is it ?

Summarize this article: A local district attorney says that the probe into Sandra Bland's death after a traffic stop is being treated \\"like a murder investigation,\\" despite preliminary information indicating that she committed suicide. Bland was arrested July 10 after a traffic stop and died three days later in her cell, sparking questions about the manner of her death and outrage. An autopsy found that she died by asphyxiation and that she used a plastic trash bag to hang herself from a partition in her cell. \\"This is being treated like a murder investigation,\\" Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday evening. \\"I want fingerprints run. I want...DNA tests run on the trash bag.\\" He also called for \\"any other valid scientific testing that we have so we can say with certainty what happened in her cell.\\" \\"There are too many questions that still need to be resolved,\\" Mathis added. The case is being run by the Texas Rangers and is being supervised by the FBI, Mathis said. But local church pastors say they and Bland’s relatives believe the case should be investigated by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Department of Justice. Her relatives have called for an independent autopsy to be completed as well, with the results expected by Tuesday. The DA's statement about the case came as Capt. Brian Cantrell, of the Waller County Sheriff's Office, gave a more detailed account of what happened after Bland's arrest as their department released three hours of footage from inside the jail. Cantrell said that Bland was taken to Waller County Jail after refusing medical attention on the scene after a confrontation with police. There, she was placed in a cell alone because she was deemed a \\"high risk\\" inmate to the safety of others based on the nature of the charge against her, Cantrell said. On the morning of Monday, July 13, jailers checked on Bland and she said she was \\"fine,\\" according to Cantrell. The jailer also said that she could use a phone that was located in the cell using a PIN number. There were no records of a call being made, Cantrell said. Just before 9 a.m., when jailers returned to see if she wanted to go to the recreation hall, they found her hanging from the privacy portion of her cell. According to Cantrell, they then put her on the ground to administer CPR. Preliminary information from the medical examiner's office indicated that she died from self-inflicted asphyxiation, Cantrell said. \\"The death of Miss Bland was a tragic incident, not one of... criminal intent,\\" Cantrell told reporters. He also expressed the department's \\"sincere condolences\\" for the death. In the wake of the incident, all trash bag liners were removed from the cells at the jail. No jailers have been disciplined as of yet. Dash cam footage of the traffic stop may be released Tuesday, Cantrell said. Mathis said that Bland appeared to be \\"very combative\\" during the traffic stop. \\"It was not a model traffic stop and it was not a model person that was stopped,\\" Mathis told reporters, referring to whether or not Bland was compliant. He noted that the dash cam footage may not clarify what happened because much of the activity takes place in Bland's car, of which there was a limited view. Supporters of Bland, a 28-year-old woman and Black Lives Matter activist who was arrested July 10 and found dead in her cell three days later, said today they have already seen the dash-cam video that they say shows an officer dragging Bland out of her car and chastising her for smoking in her vehicle. \\"She has the right to smoke in her car. That is her right,\\" the Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant of Baltimore, who has been working to raise awareness of the case, said at a news conference in Texas this morning. Mathis said that the assertion that Bland was pulled out of her car window was untrue. Byrant said “there are many questions that must be answered.” “We are not satisfied with the explanation that she committed suicide,” he said. “We are in a state of emergency here in Texas. We are not afraid of ISIS, we're afraid of the police.” ||||| Authorities in Texas have released a video covering the three hours before Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell. NBC Chicago's Phil Rogers reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015) Texas authorities on Monday released a three-hour video taken from outside a jail cell where an Illinois woman arrested during a traffic stop was found dead. The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest. Video Footage Shows Hours Leading Up to Illinois Woman's Jail Cell Death The video from a motion-operated camera shows there was no activity for 90 minutes in the hallway leading to the cell where authorities say 28-year-old Sandra Bland was found hanged on July 13, three days after her arrest. NBC Chicago's Regina Waldroup reports. (Published Monday, July 20, 2015) Authorities also said dashcam video of Bland's arrest is expected to be released Tuesday. Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathis said Monday the video is consistent with information the officer has provided about the traffic stop. The Texas Department of Public Safety has said Bland was arrested after she allegedly kicked an officer. But Mathis cautioned that the dashcam video shows only restricted views of the stop in Prairie View, Texas. The Chicago-area black woman's death at the Waller County jail in Hempstead, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers. The FBI and the Texas Rangers are investigating. \\"This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,\\" Mathis said. Bland's death been ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, a finding that supporters and relatives dispute. Bland's family and others have called for a Justice Department probe and an independent autopsy. \\"This was not a case of suicide, but homicide,\\" Rev. Jamal Bryant, of the Empowerment Temple AME Church of Baltimore, said earlier Monday. He said he was in Hempstead at the Bland family's request. DPS has said the trooper who stopped Bland violated traffic stop procedures and the department's courtesy policy, but hasn't elaborated further. The trooper is on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Bland may have been trying to text or email in the moments after she was pulled over for an improper lane change, Mathis said Monday. \\"Sandra Bland was very combative,\\" the district attorney said. \\"It was not a model traffic stop ... and it was not a model person that was stopped on a traffic stop. I think the public can make its own determinations as to the behaviors that are seen in the video.\\" The video from the jail released Monday shows no activity in the hallway leading to Bland's cell for about 90 minutes until an officer goes to check on her. It shows a deputy reacting to what she sees while looking in the cell, triggering a frenzy of activity involving other deputies. An EMT crew arrives with a wheeled stretcher. The video does not show the inside of her cell or even her cell door. Deputies and medical personnel are seen coming and going, but a body isn't visible. Capt. Brian Cantrell, head of the sheriff's department criminal investigation division, said the video was motion sensitive, indicating if nothing is taking place after a certain amount of time, it turns off. He said the FBI has been given hard drives to determine if there's been any manipulation. Cantrell said a guard checked with Bland about two hours before she was found dead and Bland told her, \\"I'm fine.\\" About an hour later, she asked to make a telephone call from her cell and was advised the phone was on a wall in the cell, according to Cantrell. There is no record of her ever making a phone call, he said. Mathis also said jail records show Bland was offered a medical checkup but declined. Cantrell declined to describe Bland's death in detail. He described the plastic garbage bag used as a ligature by extending his hands about 5 to 6 feet apart. The bags, he said, had been approved by a jail inspector, but have since been removed from all cells. Relatives and friends have insisted she was upbeat and looking forward to a new job at Prairie View A&M University, the school where she graduated in 2009. She was in the area to interview for the job and accepted it. Mathis also said the dashcam video doesn't provide a complete view. The trooper's dash cam shows a view forward toward Bland's car, but not inside and not to the side, where she wound up on the ground after authorities said she kicked the officer. \\"It doesn't show how she got on the ground,\\" Cantrell said. Copyright Associated Press / NBC Chicago ||||| HEMPSTEAD, Tex. — The authorities on Monday offered new details of the final hours of the life of a Chicago-area woman who was found hanged in a jail cell in Texas three days after she was arrested during a traffic stop. A Waller County sheriff’s official described a timeline for the jail cell of the woman, Sandra Bland, that started early in the morning of July 13, when she refused a breakfast tray around 6:30 a.m., until a jailer found her hanging shortly after 9 a.m. For about 90 minutes during that period, there was no movement by jail officials in the hallway leading to her cell, according to a video that the authorities released from a camera inside the jail. “This investigation is still being treated just as it would be a murder investigation,” the Waller County district attorney, Elton Mathis, said. He said the case is likely to be turned over to a grand jury expected to be impaneled in August. Mr. Mathis said he expected investigators to release a dashboard camera video of Ms. Bland’s arrest on Tuesday. “There are too many questions that need to be resolved,” Mr. Mathis told reporters, saying that the Bland family “does make valid points” that Ms. Bland seemed to “have a lot of things going on in her life for good.” Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff’s Office said that Ms. Bland replied “I’m fine” when a jailer was conducting rounds shortly after 7 a.m. and later inquired about how to make a phone call. But shortly after 9 a.m., a female jailer saw Ms. Bland hanging in her cell and summoned help. Other officers and emergency medical personnel tried unsuccessfully to administer CPR. The death of Ms. Bland has set off protests and calls for a federal investigation from her relatives and supporters, who have sharply disputed the official ruling by the Harris County medical examiner that her death was a suicide. They said Ms. Bland, who was black, was a vocal opponent of police brutality, and they have requested an independent autopsy. United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, on Monday urged the Justice Department to investigate the death. Photo “Someone’s child died; some young woman died that this family loves, and we owe them an explanation,” Ms. Jackson Lee said in asking Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch to begin an inquiry. “I cannot sense under the facts that I know now that a 28-year-old young woman, excited about a new job, posed a threat to anybody in Waller County, including any law enforcement officer.” The Texas Department of Public Safety has said the Texas Rangers and the F.B.I. are also investigating the case. Hempstead, the county seat of Waller County, is about 60 miles northwest of Houston. Ms. Bland had come to the county from her home in Naperville, Ill., for a job at Prairie View A&M; University. Ms. Bland was arrested on July 10 in Waller County by an officer with the Department of Public Safety on a charge of assaulting a public servant. She had been pulled over for failing to signal a lane change. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story A lawyer for the family, Cannon Lambert, told NBC News that the dashcam video showed that the encounter between Ms. Bland and the state trooper became confrontational after she refused the officer’s demand to put out a cigarette. The authorities said she hanged herself with a plastic bag, resulting in death by self-inflicted asphyxiation. A handful of supporters of Ms. Bland gathered Monday in sweltering midday heat outside the Waller County Sheriff’s Office, which holds the jail cell where she died, continuing a vigil that began last week. Brandi Holmes of Houston held a sign reading, “What happened to Sandy Bland?” Another sign read, “State police profiling — you stopped her for what.” The Rev. David Madison, president of the A.M.E. Ministers Alliance in Houston, said the demonstrators were united behind the calls for a Justice Department investigation. “We’re not accepting the report of death suicide,” said the minister, who is pastor of the Greater Ward A.M.E. Church in Houston. “Sandra Bland had just moved from Chicago to Houston to start a new job. You don’t come all the way to Houston just to kill yourself.” The death has fueled additional tensions over the treatment of African-Americans in police custody and comes roughly three months after the death of Freddie Gray, 25, an unarmed African-American in Baltimore who died from injuries sustained while being transported in a police van. Photo Ms. Jackson Lee was among a bipartisan group of Houston-area officials who were in Hempstead over the week to express concern about the case and meet with members of Ms. Bland’s family. The group included Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican; State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat; and State Senator Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. |||||","completion":"Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, was arrested on July 10th after a traffic stop and found dead in her cell three days later.

Michelle Dockery, resplendent in Rosie Assoulin, met Micaela through her make-up artist. When the 12 Years A Slave star Lupita Nyong'o stepped out at last year's Oscars, left, in a flowing blue Prada gown, with a slashed yet sophisticated neckline, she became a muse. Her red Ralph Lauren gown at last year's Golden Globes was also exquisite. Lupita Nyong'o looking chic in a Giambattista Valli couture dress at the Marie Claire Fresh Faces Party in 2014, left, and pushing the style boundaries in Prada at last year's MET Ball. The 31-year-old actress's striking minimalist style curated by Micaela has had the fashion world buzzing. Hits have included her silk Prada jersey maxidress with ethereal gold lattice embroidery at the Toronto Film Festival for the premiere of 12 Years A Slave. Her striking red Ralph Lauren number from the Golden Globes was simple yet stunning, while her punky Chanel gown at the MTV Movie Awards showed her ability to experiment with trends. Manhattan-born, Connecticut-raised Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers, such as Carolina Herrera, great Hollywood couturier Valentina and Chanel but works to pick a dress that reflects her client's personality and tastes. Lupita, for example, landed on every glossy magazine's best-dressed list thanks to her fresh, modern, and compellingly confident style; Micaela helps her take risks but in a wearable way. According to Vanity Fair, Micaela, who began working for the late Annabel Tollman, who was known for styling Scarlett Johansson, creates private Pinterest boards for each client. Here, as well as via text, she shares her ideas with them and what looks and styles she thinks would suit them. 'It's a conversation, a collaboration, down to a T,' she said of the process. Michelle Dockery, left, in a form-fitting Barbara Casasola dress at the Lovegold lunch last January, and, right, at 2013's Emmy Awards in a two-tone Prada gown in ruby-red satin and burgundy silk. 'We're always looking to tell a story through image. In some ways, I almost feel that the red carpet is the runway now and it’s up to, in some part, the talented actors and actresses that walk that red carpet to show the world what fashion can be.' Speaking about Micaela's influence on the red carpet, Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'Micaela is what every A-lister wants in their life: a friend, fashion insider and super stylist all tied into one. 'She has all the best designers - both established and budding - on speed dial and actually takes the time to get to know her clients and figure out what works for them. She turns to fashion-insider favorites, such as Suno, power players like Prada and fledgling designers such as Rosie Assoulin, who Michelle Dockery looks phenomenal in.' Micaela, pictured with Olivia Munn, creates private Pinterest boards for each client and shares her ideas with them. Micaela, who studied at Parsons the New School for Design, turns to trusted and classic designers when dressing her clients. Micaela won't be the only stylist working overtime around awards season - and it seems most stars have a go-to fashion expert on speed dial. Elizabeth Olsen's on-trend red carpet style has often impressed the fashion pack. But the American Godzilla actress revealed it is thanks to no natural flair of her own. The 25-year-old admitted she was forced to seek the services of Cher Coulter, a celebrity stylist, in order to keep up with the fashionable Hollywood starlets that surround her when she first started out. The younger sister of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen told The Hollywood Reporter: 'There's no way you can figure it all out, especially when you are working on films. You literally have to use a stylist. 'Whatever you wear is like a huge statement out to the world so you have to have someone help you figure it all out.' Red carpet fashion in the 90s was a whole different story, as proved by Kim Basinger, left, in mint green Escada at the 1998 Oscars and Helena Bonham Carter, right, in an off-pink prom-esque gown at the same event. Gwyneth Paltrow in a candy coloured prom gown as she arrives for the 71st annual Academy Awards in 1999, left, and Uma Thurman at the same event. Fast-forward to 2007 and the red carpet was still all about feathers, drama and show-stopping gowns. The actress added that she 'had no clue' what to wear when she began making public appearances. She said: 'I didn't even like to wear dresses to begin with.' It wasn't until the late 1980s that the 'stylist' was born, with Giorgio Armani being hailed as the gamechanger. He dressed A-listers such as Julia Robers and Jodie Foster in his designs and others began to follow suit. The classic silhouettes of the Nineties were the strapless mermaid look, and the waisted ball gown, loved by Gwyneth Paltrow. Retro glamour was the order of the day but now, stars want to stand out from the crowd and are opting for more spontaenous and somewhat risque designs. Luckily for today's stars, red carpet fashion has come a long way since the 90s. Gone are the days when stars - Cate Blanchett (left, at the Golden Globes in 1999 and, Jennifer Aniston in 2003) - played it safe in black. Cher, left, at the Oscars in 1988, right, Celine Dion in a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999. There are, of course, moments in red carpet history that will go down as game changers. Remember when Cher wore her barely-there Bob Mackie gown to pick up her Best Actress Oscar in 1988? Or when Celine Dion chose to wear a white tuxedo backwards to the Oscars in 1999? These moments of true individuality have, ultimately, paved the way for new stars to be able to express themselves on red carpets the world over. Now, we are all a little disappointed if Jennifer Aniston just wears black, or if Reese Witherspoon chooses another strapless number. We want more from our celebrities. And thanks to the efforts of designers, a lot of whom create up to six collections a year, there are thousands of bold, unique, and sometimes hand-embellished couture dresses to pick from. A prom-style dress, or something that is 'old school' (and not in a good way), won't cut it anymore. Stars such as Tilda Swinton, Kate Hudson, Julianne Moore and Lupita are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries. And it has made the world a much brighter place, fashion-wise. Stars like Kate Hudson, left, at the Oscars 2014, and Julianne Moore, right, at the Golden Globes, are very much led by creative stylists who push boundaries, shunning standard black dresses for more daring cuts and textures. The more extreme dressers, like Lady Gaga and Rihanna, are pushing the envelope even further, often championing new and emerging designers; something we wouldn't have seen years ago. And we mustn't forget the late, great Joan Rivers - the one fearless, say-what-she-thought red carpet critic who single-handily turned red carpets into a thing to be watched by the whole world. Speaking about the shift, celebrity dresser and HTC selfie stylist, Alexis Knox, who has worked with the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rita Ora, said: 'Red carpet style makes me so happy because it's not necessarily about sticking strictly to trends but more about wearing what you love and letting it be an extension of your personality. 'We've seen everything from tuxedos to top and skirt combos and while I think it's important to dress appropriately, you only get one shot on the red carpet so you may as well maximise your experience through your outfit. Getting ready is half the fun!'. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Awards season is a time when famous people wear nice clothes on a red carpet.

The piece of paper raises an ages-old question about Jesus, whose life and teachings form the heart of Christianity. Could Jesus have been married? Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen King recently explained the Coptic wording on the papyrus. She says the words mean that Jesus called Mary Magdalene, an early Christian, \\"my wife.\\" She says he did this while speaking to his disciples, or followers. \\"I don't think that this text is that significant. There are so many barriers for it to get over. You've got to show that it's reliable, and there are real questions about whether that text is reliable.\\" Professor Bock expresses other concerns about the papyrus. For example, he says, there is not enough writing on it to establish the real meaning of the words. He says the word \\"wife\\" may not mean \\"wife\\" in the traditional way. And, he says the papyrus is just one text showing that Jesus might have been married. \\"And then you've got the fact that this is one text out of many, many, many texts that don't indicate that Jesus was married. And I think had Jesus been married, the early tradition about Jesus would have reflected that.\\" Options: A the words on the papyrus are too few to be translated exactly. B the number of texts which indicate that Jesus was married is much too small. C Jesus' marriage has never been reflected in the early tradition. D the word \\"wife\\" can't have the same meaning as it had in the long past. Answer: D the word \\"wife\\" can't have the same meaning as it had in the long past. Question: The answer to this question is:","completion":"What concern does Professor Bock raise about the interpretation of the word \\"wife\\" on the papyrus in relation to Jesus' marriage?

It is unlikely that Cameron would choose to upset the dog further, considering his previous actions of escaping from it. Option 2: Reach safety next Since Cameron was trying to evade the dog and had just successfully climbed the fence, his primary concern would be to ensure that he is safe. It makes sense that he would want to continue distancing himself from the threat and reach a safe place. Option 3: Adopt a dog next Cameron's actions indicate that he was fleeing from the dog in fear. In this situation, it seems unlikely that he would want to adopt a dog, as he was trying to avoid one.

Dozens of affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union have issued travel alerts for people heading to Arizona this Fourth of July holiday weekend -- the group's latest effort to condemn the state's new immigration law. Arizona's measure stipulates that police can ask the residency status of people being investigated for a crime. \\"Although the law is not scheduled to go into effect until July 29, the ACLU is concerned that some law enforcement officers are already beginning to act on provisions of the law,\\" the ACLU said on its website. \\"We hope the alerts provide people with some measure of protection from illegal harassment from law enforcement and inform them of their rights should they encounter it.\\" The travel alerts -- issued by ACLU affiliates from as far away as Alaska and New York -- inform people of their rights when stopped by law enforcement in Arizona, the ACLU said. Critics say the new law will lead to racial profiling and prevent police from doing their jobs by undermining trust in the Latino community. City governments and organizations opposed to the law have targeted Arizona with protests and boycotts. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other state officials say the law is necessary because of the increasing number of people illegally entering the state from Mexico. In addition, Brewer has said the law does not target an individual's specific ethnicity. \\"It wouldn't matter if you are Latino or Hispanic or Norwegian,\\" she said last month. \\"If you didn't have proof of citizenship and the police officer had reasonable suspicion, he would ask and verify your citizenship. I mean, that's the way that it is. That's what the federal law says. And that's what the law in Arizona says.\\" In late May, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 57 percent of those surveyed favored Arizona's new law, while 37 percent opposed it.

Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J.

The 2012 Orionid meteor shower peaked early Sunday (Oct. 21), with forecasters predicting up to 25 meteors an hour for patient stargazers with clear skies well away from city lights. Based on accounts sent into SPACE.com, the meteor shower did not disappoint. In Norway, photographer Tommy Eliassen captured a spectacular view of the Orionids and Earth's dazzling northern lights. \\"An Orionid meteor streaking over the sky, the aurora borealis in the northern horizon and the Milky Way over my camp,\\" Eliassen told SPACE.com in an email from Korgfjellet, Hemnes in Norway. \\"A very cold but perfect night to photograph the Orionid meteor shower.\\" [Amazing Orionid Meteor Shower Photos of 2012] In Clinton Township, Mich., observer Dale Mayotte said this year's Orionid meteor display was extra special for him since he finally managed to catch a meteor on camera. \\"It only took me about 700 pictures to get this one beautiful meteor, but this is the first one I have ever captured and it happened on my 38th birthday for an EXCELLENT present to myself,\\" Mayotte told SPACE.com in an email. \\"Sitting in the cold for 2.5 hours was well worth this result.\\" The Orionid meteor shower occur every October when the Earth passes through a stream of dust left over by Halley's Comet. They appear to radiate out of the well-known constellation Orion, which is why they are called the Orionids. The meteors flare up in brilliant displays when they streak through Earth's atmosphere at about 65 kilometers per second (that's nearly 150,000 mph), according to NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams. Adams hosted a live web chat of the Orionid meteor shower late Saturday and early Sunday from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., where a camera beamed live views of the \\"shooting stars\\" display across the Internet. Adams assured her web chat audience that there will be Orionid meteors visible in the night sky tonight night and early Monday, just not as many as at the peak time between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. local time this morning. The Orionids are one of two meteor showers created by Halley's Comet each year. The Earth passes through a second stream of the comet's debris in May, leading to the Eta Aquarid meteor shower.

Options: - halitosis - fullness - overeating - gas - gain energy The answer is \\"gain energy\\" because Answer:","completion":"The primary biological purpose of eating breakfast is to \\"gain energy.\\" After a long period of sleep and fasting overnight, your body needs to replenish its energy reserves to function effectively throughout the day. By eating breakfast, you are essentially \\"breaking the fast\\" and providing your body with the necessary fuel to jump-start your metabolism and restore glucose levels. Glucose, a sugar obtained from the foods you eat, is the primary source of energy for your body. Consuming breakfast provides a steady supply of glucose to your brain and muscles, helping you maintain focus, productivity, and physical strength during the day. Skipping breakfast may not only lead to a lack of energy but also affect your mood, memory, and concentration. Furthermore, individuals who regularly eat breakfast have been shown to have better overall dietary habits and healthier body weights. Eating breakfast also prevents overeating later in the day, reducing the risk of developing obesity and associated health problems. In conclusion, the biological purpose of eating breakfast is to gain energy for your body's functions, including brain function and muscle activity, while improving overall health and promoting effective weight management."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? For Vegas, I would expect a little better. I was in Vegas for a big fight weekend, staying at the Luxor. Our group debated back and forth between Tender at the Luxor and Strip Steakhouse at Mandalay. Out of convenience we chose Tender. That was a mistake. The staff was friendly, the decor was pleasant. And then it went slightly downhill. The appetizers were just okay. The oysters were oysters and tasted fairly fresh. The salads were pretty unimaginative across the table. I ordered the standard Iceberg wedge and it was okay. I ordered the beef strip steak. It was fatty and a little grisly. Another guy ordered the ribeye medium rare and it came as beat-red rare as I've seen. Not to mention the meat was not that TENDER. Two guys ordered the grass-fed bison steaks and those were pretty good. They had a nice grass-fed taste and were cooked proper. But they weren't brilliantly seared or overly juicy. The sides were pretty mediocre as well. We had the mushrooms, the creamed spinach, and mac and cheese. Nothing out of the ordinary or memorable. Overall, it wasn't the worst steakhouse experience by any stretch. It was \\"just okay\\". We left FULL but UNIMPRESSED.

Such a question expects a response that paints a detailed picture of Sasha's personality, demeanor, or position, possibly including descriptions related to her appearance, mannerisms, and roles.

This reveals that there is an establishment or organization by this name. 2. Type of Entity: By the term \\"High School\\", it can be derived that St. Vincent-St. Mary is a certain type of educational institution.

I can use this background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \\"permanently disabled\\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Land combat did not expand outside of the immediate Iraq/Kuwait/Saudi border region, although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across Iraq, and Iraq fired missiles on Israeli and Saudi cities.\\".

Carter (our protagonist), is a reckless but brilliant inventor, working on a top-secret project that has captured the attention of the city's elite - a time machine. Convinced that his invention will make him famous, the ambitious inventor dedicates himself entirely to his work, paying no attention to the world around him. One evening, at a prestigious event, Carter overhears a conversation that leads him to uncover a plot that would threaten the entire country. A powerful secret organization plans to alter history and guarantee their continued dominance in the future. Carter, sensing the danger, decides to use his time machine to stop the malevolent group. As Carter activates his time machine, he is unexpectedly transported to the year 1868. Disoriented and on the run, he soon discovers that he has been labeled as a dangerous criminal by the secret organization and framed for a crime he didn't commit. The year they plan to arrest him is 1868. Realizing what has transpired, Carter embarks on a journey to find the truth, clear his name, thwart the sinister organization's plan, and make it back to his own time before the year ends. Carter unites with a group of courageous outcasts - an ex-convict, an excorist nun with knowledge of the secret organization, and a rebellious, charming woman who holds the key to a hidden map. Together, they embark on a thrilling adventure across 1868 America, from the dusty wild west to the corridors of political power in Washington, D.C. As they unravel the mystery and unearth the details of the ambitious plot, they encounter dangerous enemies and allies, groundbreaking technology, double-crosses, and unexpected challenges. Carter begins to realize the weight of the responsibility he carries on his shoulders, as the fate of not only his life but the course of history lies in his hands. In a nail-biting final showdown, Carter and his ragtag team confront the secret organization's ruthless leaders in their hidden lair. As the clock ticks down to his impending arrest, Carter must rely on his ingenuity, courage, and newfound friendships to restore the timestream and save the future. The film concludes with Carter successfully preventing the secret organization's plans and returning to his own time. However, the experience deeply affects him, instilling in him a new appreciation for the delicate balance of history and the connections he forged along the way. Carter's story ultimately becomes a poignant reflection on the importance of friendship, the pursuit of justice, and the power of one individual to shape the world. Stepping back into his workshop in 1850, Carter lingers for a moment to ponder his incredible adventure through time, determined to use his technological genius for the greater good."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue the pattern like this. REMEMBER THE KNITTING TENSION! In more detail, this knitting instruction can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Begin the row by knitting 5 band stitches in garter stitch. Garter stitch is achieved by knitting every row, resulting in a fabric with a subtle texture that is the same on both sides. 2. Next, knit 1 stitch in stocking stitch. Stocking stitch, also known as stockinette stitch, is created by alternating knit and purl rows. On the right side, you will have knit stitches, and on the wrong side, you will have purl stitches. 3. Then, follow the diagram M.1A as specified in your knitting pattern until 11 stitches remain on the needle. The M.1A diagram will provide visual information about the stitch pattern you need to follow, including which stitches should be knits, purls, increases, or decreases. Ensure that you follow the diagram closely for the best results. 4. After completing the M.1A diagram, finish the row with the diagram M.1B. This diagram will include 6 stitches to complement the design established in M.1A. 5. Finally, knit the last 5 stitches in garter stitch again, completing the row. 6. Continue this pattern as described above for subsequent rows. Be sure to maintain consistency in your knitting tension throughout the project. Proper knitting tension will ensure that your final piece is even, well-shaped, and matches the desired measurements specified in your pattern. Remember, as you work on your knitting project, it's essential to consistently check your gauge and tension, especially if the pattern has specific size requirements. Maintaining an even tension throughout will result in a beautiful, finished piece that matches the original design. Happy knitting!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH) were a British band formed in Liverpool, England, in 1980. The group was fronted by Holly Johnson (vocals), with Paul Rutherford (vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar), and Brian Nash (guitar). The group's 1983 debut single \\"Relax\\" was banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number six in the charts and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks, going on to enjoy prolonged chart success throughout that year and ultimately becoming the seventh best-selling UK single of all time. It also won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single. On the B-side to the group's first single, Johnson explained that the group's name derived from a page from The New Yorker magazine, featuring the headline \\"Frankie Goes Hollywood\\" and a picture of Frank Sinatra, although the magazine page Johnson referred to was actually a pop art poster by Guy Peellaert. The original group named \\"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\" dates from 1980. The nucleus of the group emerged from the late 1970s Liverpool punk scene. Lead singer Johnson had played bass with Big in Japan and had also released two solo singles. Local musicians Peter Gill (drums), Jed O'Toole (bass), and O'Toole's cousin Brian Nash (guitar) initially joined Johnson, calling themselves the Sons of Egypt. This line-up secured a number of small local gigs before disbanding. The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \\"Ped\\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \\"The Warehouse\\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford - a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys - apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \\"The Leatherpets\\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \\"Krisco Kisses\\", \\"Two Tribes\\", \\"Disneyland\\", and \\"The World Is My Oyster\\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash. In February 1983, the group was invited to record a video for \\"Relax\\" by the Channel 4 show The Tube at the Liverpool State Ballroom. After the broadcast, the Peel session was repeated on radio, and a new session recorded for the BBC, comprising \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\\", \\"The Only Star in Heaven\\" and \\"Relax\\". These performances, along with a repeat of the Tube video, convinced Trevor Horn to sign the group for his new label, ZTT Records, in May 1983.","completion":"This text is about the British band Frankie Goes to Hollywood (FGTH), which was formed in Liverpool, England, in 1980."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, we combine like terms. 76d and -71d are like terms, meaning they both have the factor d. When you subtract 71d from 76d, we get 5d. Our equation becomes: 5d - 25 = 0 Next, we want to get d all by itself on one side of the equation. In order to isolate d, we would need to undo the operations that are currently affecting d. In this case, d is being multiplied by 5 and 25 is being subtracted. To simplify the equation, we need to reverse the subtraction by adding 25 to each side of the equation: 5d - 25 + 25 = 0 + 25 This simplifies to: 5d = 25 Now, we need to undo the multiplication by dividing every term by 5: (5d) / 5 = 25 / 5 This simplifies to: d = 5 So, based on the initial equation given, the solution is d = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Summi Pontificatus is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII published on 20 October 1939. The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835 20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name. - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City. - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries . - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945.
